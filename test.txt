let there be light and there was light and god saw the light that it was good and god divided the lightfrom the darkness and god called the light day and the darkness he called nightand the evening and the morning were the first day and god said let there be a firmament in the midst of the watersand let it divide the waters from the waters and god made the firmament and divided the waters which wereunder the firmament from the waters which were above the firmamentand it was so and god called the firmament heaven and the evening and themorning were the second day and god said let the waters under the heaven be gathered togetherunto one place and let the dry land appear and it was so and god called the dry land earth and the gathering together ofthe waters called he seas and god saw that it was good and god said let the earth bring forth grass the herb yieldingseed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed isin itself upon the earth and it was so and the earth brought forth grass and herb yielding seed afterhis kind and the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself afterhis kind and god saw that it was good and the evening and the morning were the third

fowlof the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and overevery creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so god created man in his own image in the image of god createdhe him male and female created he them and god blessed them and god said unto them be fruitful andmultiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominionover the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air

tree yielding seed to you it shall be for meat and to every beast of the earth and to every fowl of the airand to every thing that creepeth upon the earth wherein there islife i have given every green herb for meat and it was so and god saw every thing that he had made and behold it wasvery good and the evening and the morning were the sixth day thus the heavens and the earth were finished and all the host ofthem and on the seventh day god ended his work which he had made andhe rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made and god blessed the seventh day and sanctified it because thatin it he had rested from all his work which god created and made these are the generations of the heavens and of the earth whenthey were created in the day that the lord god made the earth and theheavens  and every plant of the field before it was in the earthand every herb of the field before it grew for the lord god had notcaused it to rain upon the earth and there was not a man to till theground but there went up a mist from the earth and watered the wholeface of the ground and the lord god formed man of the dust of the ground andbreathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a livingsoul and the lord god planted a garden eastward in eden and there heput the man whom he had formed and out of the ground made the lord god to grow every tree that ispleasant to the sight and good for food the tree of life also in themidst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of good and evil and a river went out of eden to water the garden and from thenceit was parted and became into four heads the name of the first is pison that is it which compasseth thewhole land of havilah where there is gold  and the gold of thatland is good there is bdellium and the onyx stone and the name of the second river is gihon the same is it thatcompasseth the whole land of ethiopia and the name of the third river is hiddekel that is it whichgoeth toward the east of assyria and the fourth river is euphrates and the lord god took the man and put him into the garden ofeden to dress it and to keep it and the lord god commanded the man saying of every tree of thegarden thou mayest freely eat  but of the tree of the knowledgeof good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thoueatest thereof thou shalt surely die and the lord god said it is not good that the man should bealone i will make him an help meet for him and out of the ground the lord god formed every beast of thefield and every fowl of the air and brought them unto adam to seewhat he would call them and whatsoever adam called every livingcreature that was the name thereof and adam gave names to all cattle and to the fowl of the airand to every beast of the field but for adam there was not found anhelp meet for him and the lord god caused a deep sleep to fall upon adam and heslept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh insteadthereof  and the rib which the lord god had taken from man madehe a woman and brought her unto the man and adam said this is now bone of my bones and flesh of myflesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shallcleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh and they were both naked the man and his wife and were notashamed now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field whichthe lord god had made and he said unto the woman yea hath god saidye shall not eat of every tree of the garden   and the woman saidunto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the gardengod hath said ye shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch it lestye die and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die for god doth know that in the day ye eat thereof then your eyes shallbe opened and ye shall be as gods knowing good and evil and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and thatit was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make onewise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also untoher husband with her and he did eat and the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that theywere naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselvesaprons and they heard the voice of the lord god walking in the garden inthe cool of the day and adam and his wife hid themselves from thepresence of the lord god amongst the trees of the garden and the lord god called unto adam and said unto him where artthou   and he said i heard thy voice in the garden and i wasafraid because i was naked and i hid myself and he said who told thee that thou wast naked hast thou eatenof the tree whereof i commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat and the man said the woman whom thou gavest to be with me shegave me of the tree and i did eat and the lord god said unto the woman what is this that thou hastdone and the woman said the serpent beguiled me and i did eat and the lord god said unto the serpent because thou hast donethis thou art cursed above all cattle and above every beast of thefield upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat all thedays of thy life  and i will put enmity between thee and thewoman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy headand thou shalt bruise his heel unto the woman he said i will greatly multiply thy sorrow andthy conception in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children and thydesire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee and unto adam he said because thou hast hearkened unto the voiceof thy wife and hast eaten of the tree of which i commanded theesaying thou shalt not eat of it cursed is the ground for thy sakein sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life  thornsalso and thistles shall it bring forth to thee and thou shalt eat theherb of the field  in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat breadtill thou return unto the ground for out of it wast thou taken fordust thou art and unto dust shalt thou return and adam called his wifes name eve because she was the motherof all living unto adam also and to his wife did the lord god make coats ofskins and clothed them and the lord god said behold the man is become as one of us toknow good and evil and now lest he put forth his hand and take alsoof the tree of life and eat and live for ever  therefore thelord god sent him forth from the garden of eden to till the groundfrom whence he was taken so he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the gardenof eden cherubims and a flaming sword which turned every way to keepthe way of the tree of life and adam knew eve his wife and she conceived and bare cain andsaid i have gotten a man from the lord and she again bare his brother abel and abel was a keeper ofsheep but cain was a tiller of the ground and in process of time it came to pass that cain brought of thefruit of the ground an offering unto the lord and abel he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and ofthe fat thereof and the lord had respect unto abel and to hisoffering  but unto cain and to his offering he had not respectand cain was very wroth and his countenance fell and the lord said unto cain why art thou wroth and why is thycountenance fallen   if thou doest well shalt thou not beaccepted and if thou doest not well sin lieth at the door and untothee shall be his desire and thou shalt rule over him and cain talked with abel his brother and it came to pass whenthey were in the field that cain rose up against abel his brotherand slew him and the lord said unto cain where is abel thy brother and hesaid i know not am i my brothers keeper   and he said whathast thou done the voice of thy brothers blood crieth unto me fromthe ground and now art thou cursed from the earth which hath opened hermouth to receive thy brothers blood from thy hand  when thoutillest the ground it shall not henceforth yield unto thee herstrength a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth and cain said unto the lord my punishment is greater than i canbear behold thou hast driven me out this day from the face of theearth and from thy face shall i be hid and i shall be a fugitive anda vagabond in the earth and it shall come to pass that every onethat findeth me shall slay me and the lord said unto him therefore whosoever slayeth cainvengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold and the lord set a markupon cain lest any finding him should kill him and cain went out from the presence of the lord and dwelt in theland of nod on the east of eden and cain knew his wife and she conceived and bare enoch and hebuilded a city and called the name of the city after the name of hisson enoch and unto enoch was born irad and irad begat mehujael andmehujael begat methusael and

sister of tubalcain was naamah and lamech said unto his wives adah and zillah hear my voiceye wives of lamech hearken unto my speech for i have slain a man tomy wounding and a young man to my hurt if cain shall be avenged sevenfold truly lamech seventy andsevenfold and adam knew his wife again and she bare a son and called hisname seth for god said she hath appointed me another seed insteadof abel whom cain slew and to seth to him also there was born a son and he called hisname enos then began men to call upon the name of the lord this is the book of the generations of adam in the day that godcreated man in the likeness of god made he him  male and femalecreated he them and blessed them and called their name adam in theday when they were created and adam lived an hundred and thirty

shem hamand japheth and it came to pass when men began to multiply on the face of theearth and daughters were born unto them  that the sons of god sawthe daughters of men that they were fair and they took them wives ofall which they chose and the lord said my spirit shall not always strive with man forthat he also is flesh yet his days shall be an hundred and twentyyears there were giants in the earth in those days and also after thatwhen the sons of god came in unto the daughters of men and they barechildren to them the same became mighty men which were of old men ofrenown and god saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth andthat every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evilcontinually and it repented the lord that he had made man on the earth and itgrieved him at his heart and the lord said i will destroy man whom i have created from theface of the earth both man and beast and the creeping thing andthe fowls of the air for it repenteth me that i have made them but noah found grace in the eyes of the lord these are the generations of noah noah was a just man and perfectin his generations and noah walked with god and noah begat three sons shem ham and japheth the earth also was corrupt before god and the earth was filledwith violence and god looked upon the earth and behold it was corrupt forall flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth and god said unto noah the end of all flesh is come before mefor the earth is filled with violence through them and behold iwill destroy them with the earth make thee an ark of gopher wood rooms shalt thou make in theark and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch and this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of the lengthof the ark shall be three hundred cubits the breadth of it fiftycubits and the height of it thirty cubits a window shalt thou make to the ark and in a cubit shalt thoufinish it above and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the sidethereof with lower second and third stories shalt thou make it and behold i even i do bring a flood of waters upon theearth to destroy all flesh wherein is the breath of life from underheaven and every thing that is in the earth shall die but with thee will i establish my covenant and thou shalt comeinto the ark thou and thy sons and thy wife and thy sons wiveswith thee and of every living thing of all flesh two of every sort shaltthou bring into the ark to keep them alive with thee they shall bemale and female of fowls after their kind and of cattle after their kind ofevery creeping thing of the earth after his kind two of every sortshall come unto thee to keep them alive and take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten and thou shaltgather it to thee and it shall be for food for thee and for them thus did noah according to all that god commanded him so didhe and the lord said unto noah come thou and all thy house into theark for thee have i seen righteous before me in this generation of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens the maleand his female and of beasts that are not clean by two the male andhis female of fowls also of the air by sevens the male and the female tokeep seed alive upon the face of all the earth for yet seven days and i will cause it to rain upon the earthforty days and forty nights and every living substance that i havemade will i destroy from off the face of the earth and noah did according unto all that the lord commanded him and noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters wasupon the earth and noah went in and his sons and his wife and his sons wiveswith him into the ark because of the waters of the flood of clean beasts and of beasts that are not clean and of fowlsand of every thing that creepeth upon the earth  there went in twoand two unto noah into the ark the male and the female as god hadcommanded noah and it came to pass after seven days that the waters of theflood were upon the earth in the six hundredth year of noahs life in the second monththe seventeenth day of the month the same day were all the fountainsof the great deep broken up and the windows of heaven were opened and the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights in the selfsame day entered noah and shem and ham and japheththe sons of noah and noahs wife and the three wives of his sonswith them into the ark  they and every beast after his kindand all the cattle after their kind and every creeping thing thatcreepeth upon the earth after his kind and every fowl after his kindevery bird of every sort and they went in unto noah into the ark two and two of allflesh wherein is the breath of life and they that went in went in male and female of all flesh asgod had commanded him and the lord shut him in and the flood was forty days upon the earth and the watersincreased and bare up the ark and it was lift up above the earth and the waters prevailed and were increased greatly upon theearth and the ark went upon the face of the waters and the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth and all thehigh hills that were under the whole heaven were covered fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail and the mountainswere covered and all flesh died that moved upon the earth both of fowl andof cattle and of beast and of every creeping thing that creepethupon the earth and every man  all in whose nostrils was thebreath of life of all that was in the dry land died and every living substance was destroyed which was upon the faceof the ground both man and cattle and the creeping things and thefowl of the heaven and they were destroyed from the earth and noahonly remained alive and they that were with him in the ark and the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fiftydays and god remembered noah and every living thing and all thecattle that was with him in the ark and god made a wind to pass overthe earth and the waters asswaged  the fountains also of the deepand the windows of heaven were stopped and the rain from heaven wasrestrained  and the waters returned from off the earthcontinually and after the end of the hundred and fifty days thewaters were abated and the ark rested in the seventh month on the seventeenth day ofthe month upon the mountains of ararat and the waters decreased continually until the tenth month in thetenth month on the first day of the month were the tops of themountains seen and it came to pass at the end of forty days that noah opened thewindow of the ark which he had made  and he sent forth a ravenwhich went forth to and fro until the waters were dried up from offthe earth also he sent forth a dove from him to see if the waters wereabated from off the face of the ground  but the dove found no restfor the sole of her foot and she returned unto him into the ark forthe waters were on the face of the whole earth then he put forth hishand and took her and pulled her in unto him into the ark and he stayed yet other seven days and again he sent forth thedove out of the ark  and the dove came in to him in the eveningand lo in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off so noah knew thatthe waters were abated from off the earth and he stayed yet other seven days and sent forth the dovewhich returned not again unto him any more and it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year in thefirst month the first day of the month the waters were dried up fromoff the earth and noah removed the covering of the ark and lookedand behold the face of the ground was dry and in the second month on the seven and twentieth day of themonth was the earth dried and god spake unto noah saying  go forth of the ark thouand thy wife and thy sons and thy sons wives with thee bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee ofall flesh both of fowl and of cattle and of every creeping thingthat creepeth upon the earth that they may breed abundantly in theearth and be fruitful and multiply upon the earth and noah went forth and his sons and his wife and his sonswives with him  every beast every creeping thing and everyfowl and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth after their kinds wentforth out of the ark and noah builded an altar unto the lord and took of every cleanbeast and of every clean fowl and offered burnt offerings on thealtar and the lord smelled a sweet savour and the lord said in hisheart i will not again curse the ground any more for mans sake forthe imagination of mans heart is evil from his youth neither will iagain smite any more every thing living as i have done while the earth remaineth seedtime and harvest and cold andheat and summer and winter and day and night shall not cease and god blessed noah and his sons and said unto them befruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beastof the earth and upon every fowl of the air upon all that movethupon the earth and upon all the fishes of the sea into your hand arethey delivered every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you even as thegreen herb have i given you all things but flesh with the life thereof which is the blood thereof shallye not eat and surely your blood of your lives will i require at the hand ofevery beast will i require it and at the hand of man at the hand ofevery mans brother will i require the life of man whoso sheddeth mans blood by man shall his blood be shed for inthe image of god made he man and you be ye fruitful and multiply bring forth abundantly inthe earth and multiply therein and god spake unto noah and to his sons with him saying  andi behold i establish my covenant with you and with your seed afteryou  and with every living creature that is with you of thefowl of the cattle and of every beast of the earth with you fromall that go out of the ark to every beast of the earth and i will establish my covenant with you neither shall allflesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood neither shallthere any more be a flood to destroy the earth and god said this is the token of the covenant which i makebetween me and you and every living creature that is with you forperpetual generations  i do set my bow in the cloud and it shallbe for a token of a covenant between me and the earth and it shall come to pass when i bring a cloud over the earththat the bow shall be seen in the cloud  and i will remember mycovenant which is between me and you and every living creature of allflesh and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy allflesh and the bow shall be in the cloud and i will look upon it thati may remember the everlasting covenant between god and every livingcreature of all flesh that is upon the earth and god said unto noah this is the token of the covenant whichi have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth and the sons of noah that went forth of the ark were shem andham and japheth and ham is the father of canaan these are the three sons of noah and of them was the whole earthoverspread and noah began to be an husbandman and he planted a vineyard and he drank of the wine and was drunken and he was uncoveredwithin his tent and ham the father of canaan saw the nakedness of his fatherand told his two brethren without and shem and japheth took a garment and laid it upon both theirshoulders and went backward and covered the nakedness of theirfather and their faces were backward and they saw not their fathersnakedness and noah awoke from his wine and knew what his younger son haddone unto him and he said cursed be canaan a servant of servants shall he beunto his brethren and he said blessed be the lord god of shem and canaan shall behis servant god shall enlarge japheth and he shall dwell in the tents ofshem and canaan shall be his servant and noah lived after the flood three

of the sons of noah after theirgenerations in their nations and by these were the nations dividedin the earth after the flood and the whole earth was of one language and of one speech and it came to pass as they journeyed from the east that theyfound a plain in the land of shinar and they dwelt there and they said one to another go to let us make brick and burnthem thoroughly and they had brick for stone and slime had they formorter and they said go to let us build us a city and a tower whosetop may reach unto heaven and let us make us a name lest we bescattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth and the lord came down to see the city and the tower which thechildren of men builded and the lord said behold the people is one and they have allone language and this they begin to do and now nothing will berestrained from them which they have imagined to do go to let us go down and there confound their language thatthey may not understand one anothers speech so the lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face ofall the earth and they left off to build the city therefore is the name of it called babel because the lord didthere confound the language of all the earth and from

builded an altar unto the lord and called upon the nameof the lord and abram journeyed going on still toward the south and there was a famine in the land and abram went down intoegypt to sojourn there for the famine was grievous in the land and it came to pass when he was come near to enter into egyptthat he said unto sarai his wife behold now i know that thou art afair woman to look upon  therefore it shall come to pass whenthe egyptians shall see thee that they shall say this is his wifeand they will kill me but they will save thee alive say i pray thee thou art my sister that it may be well withme for thy sake and my soul shall live because of thee and it came to pass that when abram was come into egypt theegyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair the princes also of pharaoh saw her and commended her beforepharaoh and the woman was taken into pharaohs house and he entreated abram well for her sake and he had sheep andoxen and he asses and menservants and maidservants and she assesand camels and the lord plagued pharaoh and his house with great plaguesbecause of sarai abrams wife and pharaoh called abram and said what is this that thou hastdone unto me why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife  why saidst thou she is my sister so i might have taken her to me towife now therefore behold thy wife take her and go thy way and pharaoh commanded his men concerning him and they sent himaway and his wife and all that he had and abram went up out of egypt he and his wife and all that hehad and lot with him into the south and abram was very rich in cattle in silver and in gold and he went on his journeys from the south even to bethel untothe place where his tent had been at the beginning between bethel andhai  unto the place of the altar which he had make there at thefirst and there abram called on the name of the lord and lot also which went with abram had flocks and herds andtents and the land was not able to bear them that they might dwelltogether for their substance was great so that they could not dwelltogether and there was a strife between the herdmen of abrams cattle andthe herdmen of lots cattle and the canaanite and the perizzitedwelled then in the land and abram said unto lot let there be no strife i pray theebetween me and thee and between my herdmen and thy herdmen for we bebrethren is not the whole land before thee separate thyself i pray theefrom me if thou wilt take the left hand then i will go to the rightor if thou depart to the right hand then i will go to the left and lot lifted up his eyes and beheld all the plain of jordanthat it was well watered every where before the lord destroyed sodomand gomorrah even as the garden of the lord like the land of egyptas thou comest unto zoar then lot chose him all the plain of jordan and lot journeyedeast and they separated themselves the one from the other abram dwelled in the land of canaan and lot dwelled in thecities of the plain and pitched his tent toward sodom but the men of sodom were wicked and sinners before the lordexceedingly and the lord said unto abram after that lot was separated fromhim lift up now thine eyes and look from the place where thou artnorthward and southward and eastward and westward  for allthe land which thou seest to thee will i give it and to thy seed forever and i will make thy seed as the dust of the earth so that if aman can number the dust of the earth then shall thy seed also benumbered arise walk through the land in the length of it and in thebreadth of it for i will give it unto thee then abram removed his tent and came and dwelt in the plain ofmamre which is in hebron and built there an altar unto the lord and it came to pass in the days of amraphel king of shinararioch king of ellasar chedorlaomer king of elam and tidal king ofnations  that these made war with bera king of sodom and withbirsha king of gomorrah shinab king of admah and shemeber king ofzeboiim and the king of bela

is by the wilderness and they returned and came to enmishpat which is kadesh andsmote all the country of the amalekites and also the amorites thatdwelt in hazezontamar and there went out the king of sodom and the king of gomorrahand the king of admah and the king of zeboiim and the king of belathe same is zoar and they joined battle with them in the vale ofsiddim  with chedorlaomer the king of elam and with tidal kingof nations and amraphel king of shinar and arioch king of ellasarfour kings with five and the vale of siddim was full of slimepits and the kings ofsodom and gomorrah fled and fell there and they that remained fledto the mountain and they took all the goods of sodom and gomorrah and all theirvictuals and went their way and they took lot abrams brothers son who dwelt in sodomand his goods and departed and there came one that had escaped and told abram the hebrewfor he dwelt in the plain of mamre the amorite brother of eshcol andbrother of aner and these were confederate with abram and when abram heard that his brother was taken captive hearmed his trained servants born in his own house three hundred andeighteen and pursued them unto dan and he divided himself against them he and his servants bynight and smote them and pursued them unto hobah which is on theleft hand of damascus and he brought back all the goods and also brought again hisbrother lot and his goods and the women also and the people and the king of sodom went out to meet him after his return fromthe slaughter of chedorlaomer and of the kings that were with him atthe valley of shaveh which is the kings dale and melchizedek king of salem brought forth bread and wine andhe was the priest of the most high god and he blessed him and said blessed be abram of the most highgod possessor of heaven and earth  and blessed be the most highgod which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand and he gave himtithes of all and the king of sodom said unto abram give me the persons andtake the goods to thyself and abram said to the king of sodom i have lift up mine handunto the lord the most high god the possessor of heaven and earth that i will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet andthat i will not take any thing that is thine lest thou shouldest sayi have made abram rich  save only that which the young men haveeaten and the portion of the men which went with me aner eshcoland mamre let them take their portion after these things the word of the lord came unto abram in avision saying fear not abram i am thy shield and thy exceedinggreat reward and abram said lord god what wilt thou give me seeing i gochildless and the steward of my house is this eliezer of damascus and abram said behold to me thou hast given no seed and loone born in my house is mine heir and behold the word of the lord came unto him saying thisshall not be thine heir but he that shall come forth out of thine ownbowels shall be thine heir and he brought him forth abroad and said look now towardheaven and tell the stars if thou be able to number them and hesaid unto him so shall thy seed be and he believed in the lord and he counted it to him forrighteousness and he said unto him i am the lord that brought thee out of urof the chaldees to give thee this land to inherit it and he said lord god whereby shall i know that i shall inheritit   and he said unto him take me an heifer of three years oldand a she goat of three years old and a ram of three years old and aturtledove and a young pigeon and he took unto him all these and divided them in the midstand laid each piece one against another but the birds divided he not and when the fowls came down upon the carcases abram drove themaway and when the sun was going down a deep sleep fell upon abramand lo an horror of great darkness fell upon him and he said unto abram know of a surety that thy seed shall bea stranger in a land that is not theirs and shall serve them andthey shall afflict them four hundred years  and also thatnation whom they shall serve will i judge and afterward shall theycome out with great substance and thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace thou shalt be buriedin a good old age but in the fourth generation they shall come hither again forthe iniquity of the amorites is not yet full and it came to pass that when the sun went down and it wasdark behold a smoking furnace and a burning lamp that passed betweenthose pieces in the same day the lord made a covenant with abram sayingunto thy seed have i given this land from the river of egypt unto thegreat river the river euphrates  the kenites and thekenizzites and the kadmonites  and the hittites and theperizzites and the rephaims  and the amorites and thecanaanites and the girgashites and the jebusites now sarai abrams wife bare him no children and she had anhandmaid an egyptian whose name was hagar and sarai said unto abram behold now the lord hath restrainedme from bearing i pray thee go in unto my maid it may be that i mayobtain children by her and abram hearkened to the voice of sarai and sarai abrams wife took hagar her maid the egyptian afterabram had dwelt ten years in the land of canaan and gave her to herhusband abram to be his wife and he went in unto hagar and she conceived and when she sawthat she had conceived her mistress was despised in her eyes and sarai said unto abram my wrong be upon thee i have given mymaid into thy bosom and when she saw that she had conceived i wasdespised in her eyes the lord judge between me and thee but abram said unto sarai behold thy maid is in thine hand doto her as it pleaseth thee and when sarai dealt hardly with her shefled from her face and the angel of the lord found her by a fountain of water in thewilderness by the fountain in the way to shur and he said hagar sarais maid whence camest thou and whitherwilt thou go and she said i flee from the face of my mistress sarai and the angel of the lord said unto her return to thy mistressand submit thyself under her hands and the angel of the lord said unto her i will multiply thyseed exceedingly that it shall not be numbered for multitude and the angel of the lord said unto her behold thou art withchild and shalt bear a son and shalt call his name ishmael becausethe lord hath heard thy affliction and he will be a wild man his hand will be against every manand every mans hand against him and he shall dwell in the presenceof all his brethren and she called the name of the lord that spake unto her thougod seest me for she said have i also here looked after him thatseeth me   wherefore the well was called beerlahairoi beholdit is between kadesh and bered and hagar bare abram a son and abram called his sons namewhich hagar bare ishmael and abram was fourscore and six years old when hagar bareishmael to abram and when abram was ninety years old and nine the lord appearedto abram and said unto him i am the almighty god walk before meand be thou perfect and i will make my covenant between me and thee and willmultiply thee exceedingly and abram fell on his face and god talked with him saying as for me behold my covenant is with thee and thou shalt be afather of many nations neither shall thy name any more be called abram but thy nameshall be abraham for a father of many nations have i made thee and i will make thee exceeding fruitful and i will make nationsof thee and kings shall come out of thee and i will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seedafter thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant to be agod unto thee and to thy seed after thee and i will give unto thee and to thy seed after thee the landwherein thou art a stranger all the land of canaan for aneverlasting possession and i will be their god and god said unto abraham thou shalt keep my covenant thereforethou and thy seed after thee in their generations this is my covenant which ye shall keep between me and you andthy seed after thee every man child among you shall be circumcised and ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin and it shallbe a token of the covenant betwixt me and you and he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among youevery man child in your generations he that is born in the house orbought with money of any stranger which is not of thy seed he that is born in thy house and he that is bought with thymoney must needs be circumcised and my covenant shall be in yourflesh for an everlasting covenant and the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin isnot circumcised that soul shall be cut off from his people he hathbroken my covenant and god said unto abraham as for sarai thy wife thou shalt notcall her name sarai but sarah shall her name be and i will bless her and give thee a son also of her yea iwill bless her and she shall be a mother of nations kings of peopleshall be of her then abraham fell upon his face and laughed and said in hisheart shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years oldand shall sarah that is ninety years old bear   and abrahamsaid unto god o that ishmael might live before thee   and godsaid sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed and thou shalt callhis name isaac and i will establish my covenant with him for aneverlasting covenant and with his seed after him and as for ishmael i have heard thee behold i have blessedhim and will make him fruitful and will multiply him exceedinglytwelve princes shall he beget and i will make him a great nation but my covenant will i establish with isaac which sarah shallbear unto thee at this set time in the next year and he left off talking with him and god went up from abraham and abraham took ishmael his son and all that were born in hishouse and all that were bought with his money every male among themen of abrahams house and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin inthe selfsame day as god had said unto him and abraham was ninety years old and nine when he wascircumcised in the flesh of his foreskin and ishmael his son was thirteen years old when he wascircumcised in the flesh of his foreskin in the selfsame day was abraham circumcised and ishmael hisson and all the men of his house born in the house and bought withmoney of the stranger were circumcised with him and the lord appeared unto him in the plains of mamre and he satin the tent door in the heat of the day  and he lift up his eyesand looked and lo three men stood by him and when he saw them heran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself toward theground  and said my lord if now i have found favour in thysight pass not away i pray thee from thy servant  let a littlewater i pray you be fetched and wash your feet and rest yourselvesunder the tree  and i will fetch a morsel of bread and comfortye your hearts after that ye shall pass on for therefore are ye cometo your servant and they said so do as thou hast said and abraham hastened into the tent unto sarah and said makeready quickly three measures of fine meal knead it and make cakesupon the hearth and abraham ran unto the herd and fetcht a calf tender and goodand gave it unto a young man and he hasted to dress it and he took butter and milk and the calf which he had dressedand set it before them and he stood by them under the tree and theydid eat and they said unto him where is sarah thy wife and he saidbehold in the tent and he said i will certainly return unto thee according to thetime of life and lo sarah thy wife shall have a son and sarahheard it in the tent door which was behind him now abraham and sarah were old and well stricken in age and itceased to be with sarah after the manner of women therefore sarah laughed within herself saying after i am waxedold shall i have pleasure my lord being old also   and the lordsaid unto abraham wherefore did sarah laugh saying shall i of asurety bear a child which am old   is any thing too hard forthe lord at the time appointed i will return unto thee according tothe time of life and sarah shall have a son then sarah denied saying i laughed not for she was afraidand he said nay but thou didst laugh and the men rose up from thence and looked toward sodom andabraham went with them to bring them on the way and the lord said shall i hide from abraham that thing which ido  seeing that abraham shall surely become a great and mightynation and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him for i know him that he will command his children and hishousehold after him and they shall keep the way of the lord to dojustice and judgment that the lord may bring upon abraham that whichhe hath spoken of him and the lord said because the cry of sodom and gomorrah isgreat and because their sin is very grievous  i will go downnow and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry ofit which is come unto me and if not i will know and the men turned their faces from thence and went towardsodom but abraham stood yet before the lord and abraham drew near and said wilt thou also destroy therighteous with the wicked   peradventure there be fiftyrighteous within the city wilt thou also destroy and not spare theplace for the fifty righteous that are therein   that be farfrom thee to do after this manner to slay the righteous with thewicked and that the righteous should be as the wicked that be farfrom thee shall not the judge of all the earth do right   andthe lord said if i find in sodom fifty righteous within the citythen i will spare all the place for their sakes and abraham answered and said behold now i have taken upon meto speak unto the lord which am but dust and ashes peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous wilt thoudestroy all the city for lack of five and he said if i find thereforty and five i will not destroy it and he spake unto him yet again and said peradventure thereshall be forty found there and he said i will not do it for fortyssake and he said unto him oh let not the lord be angry and i willspeak peradventure there shall thirty be found there and he said iwill not do it if i find thirty there and he said behold now i have taken upon me to speak unto thelord peradventure there shall be twenty found there and he said iwill not destroy it for twentys sake and he said oh let not the lord be angry and i will speak yetbut this once peradventure ten shall be found there and he said iwill not destroy it for tens sake and the lord went his way as soon as he had left communing withabraham and abraham returned unto his place and there came two angels to sodom at even and lot sat in thegate of sodom and lot seeing them rose up to meet them and he bowedhimself with his face toward the ground  and he said behold nowmy lords turn in i pray you into your servants house and tarryall night and wash your feet and ye shall rise up early and go onyour ways and they said nay but we will abide in the street allnight and he pressed upon them greatly and they turned in unto himand entered into his house and he made them a feast and did bakeunleavened bread and they did eat but before they lay down the men of the city even the men ofsodom compassed the house round both old and young all the peoplefrom every quarter  and they called unto lot and said unto himwhere are the men which came in to thee this night bring them outunto us that we may know them and lot went out at the door unto them and shut the door afterhim  and said i pray you brethren do not so wickedly behold now i have two daughters which have not known man letme i pray you bring them out unto you and do ye to them as is goodin your eyes only unto these men do nothing for therefore came theyunder the shadow of my roof and they said stand back and they said again this one fellowcame in to sojourn and he will needs be a judge now will we dealworse with thee than with them and they pressed sore upon the maneven lot and came near to break the door but the men put forth their hand and pulled lot into the houseto them and shut to the door and they smote the men that were at the door of the house withblindness both small and great so that they wearied themselves tofind the door and the men said unto lot hast thou here any besides son inlaw and thy sons and thy daughters and whatsoever thou hast in thecity bring them out of this place  for we will destroy thisplace because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of thelord and the lord hath sent us to destroy it and lot went out and spake unto his sons in law which marriedhis daughters and said up get you out of this place for the lordwill destroy this city but he seemed as one that mocked unto his sonsin law and when the morning arose then the angels hastened lotsaying arise take thy wife and thy two daughters which are herelest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city and while he lingered the men laid hold upon his hand and uponthe hand of his wife and upon the hand of his two daughters the lordbeing merciful unto him and they brought him forth and set himwithout the city and it came to pass when they had brought them forth abroadthat he said escape for thy life look not behind thee neither staythou in all the plain escape to the mountain lest thou be consumed and lot said unto them oh not so my lord  behold nowthy servant hath found grace in thy sight and thou hast magnified thymercy which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life and i cannotescape to the mountain lest some evil take me and i die behold now this city is near to flee unto and it is a little oneoh let me escape thither is it not a little one and my soul shalllive and he said unto him see i have accepted thee concerning thisthing also that i will not overthrow this city for the which thouhast spoken haste thee escape thither for i cannot do anything till thoube come thither therefore the name of the city was called zoar the sun was risen upon the earth when lot entered into zoar then the lord rained upon sodom and upon gomorrah brimstone andfire from the lord out of heaven  and he overthrew those citiesand all the plain and all the inhabitants of the cities and thatwhich grew upon the ground but his wife looked back from behind him and she became apillar of salt and abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where hestood before the lord  and he looked toward sodom and gomorrahand toward all the land of the plain and beheld and lo the smokeof the country went up as the smoke of a furnace and it came to pass when god destroyed the cities of the plainthat god remembered abraham and sent lot out of the midst of theoverthrow when he overthrew the cities in the which lot dwelt and lot went up out of zoar and dwelt in the mountain and histwo daughters with him for he feared to dwell in zoar and he dweltin a cave he and his two daughters and the firstborn said unto the younger our father is old andthere is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner ofall the earth  come let us make our father drink wine and wewill lie with him that we may preserve seed of our father and they made their father drink wine that night and thefirstborn went in and lay with her father and he perceived not whenshe lay down nor when she arose and it came to pass on the morrow that the firstborn said untothe younger behold i lay yesternight with my father let us make himdrink wine this night also and go thou in and lie with him that wemay preserve seed of our father and they made their father drink wine that night also and theyounger arose and lay with him and he perceived not when she laydown nor when she arose thus were both the daughters of lot with child by their father and the first born bare a son and called his name moab thesame is the father of the moabites unto this day and the younger she also bare a son and called his namebenammi the same is the father of the children of ammon unto thisday and abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country anddwelled between kadesh and shur and sojourned in gerar and abraham said of sarah his wife she is my sister andabimelech king of gerar sent and took sarah but god came to abimelech in a dream by night and said to himbehold thou art but a dead man for the woman which thou hast takenfor she is a mans wife but abimelech had not come near her and he said lord wilt thouslay also a righteous nation   said he not unto me she is mysister and she even she herself said he is my brother in theintegrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have i done this and god said unto him in a dream yea i know that thou didstthis in the integrity of thy heart for i also withheld thee fromsinning against me therefore suffered i thee not to touch her now therefore restore the man his wife for he is a prophet andhe shall pray for thee and thou shalt live and if thou restore hernot know thou that thou shalt surely die thou and all that arethine therefore abimelech rose early in the morning and called all hisservants and told all these things in their ears and the men weresore afraid then abimelech called abraham and said unto him what hast thoudone unto us and what have i offended thee that thou hast brought onme and on my kingdom a great sin thou hast done deeds unto me thatought not to be done and abimelech said unto abraham what sawest thou that thouhast done this thing   and abraham said because i thoughtsurely the fear of god is not in this place and they will slay me formy wifes sake and yet indeed she is my sister she is the daughter of myfather but not the daughter of my mother and she became my wife and it came to pass when god caused me to wander from myfathers house that i said unto her this is thy kindness which thoushalt shew unto me at every place whither we shall come say of mehe is my brother and abimelech took sheep and oxen and menservants andwomenservants and gave them unto abraham and restored him sarah hiswife and abimelech said behold my land is before thee dwell whereit pleaseth thee and unto sarah he said behold i have given thy brother athousand pieces of silver behold he is to thee a covering of theeyes unto all that are with thee and with all other thus she wasreproved so abraham prayed unto god and god healed abimelech and hiswife and his maidservants and they bare children for the lord had fast closed up all the wombs of the house ofabimelech because of sarah abrahams wife and the lord visited sarah as he had said and the lord did untosarah as he had spoken for sarah conceived and bare abraham a son in his old age atthe set time of which god had spoken to him and abraham called the name of his son that was born unto himwhom sarah bare to him isaac and abraham circumcised his son isaac being eight days old asgod had commanded him and abraham was an hundred years old when his son isaac was bornunto him and sarah said god hath made me to laugh so that all that hearwill laugh with me and she said who would have said unto abraham that sarah shouldhave given children suck for i have born him a son in his old age and the child grew and was weaned and abraham made a greatfeast the same day that isaac was weaned and sarah saw the son of hagar the egyptian which she had bornunto abraham mocking wherefore she said unto abraham cast out this bondwoman and herson for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son evenwith isaac and the thing was very grievous in abrahams sight because ofhis son and god said unto abraham let it not be grievous in thy sightbecause of the lad and because of thy bondwoman in all that sarahhath said unto thee hearken unto her voice for in isaac shall thyseed be called and also of the son of the bondwoman will i make a nationbecause he is thy seed and abraham rose up early in the morning and took bread and abottle of water and gave it unto hagar putting it on her shoulderand the child and sent her away and she departed and wandered inthe wilderness of beersheba and the water was spent in the bottle and she cast the childunder one of the shrubs and she went and sat her down over against him a good way offas it were a bow shot for she said let me not see the death of thechild and she sat over against him and lift up her voice and wept and god heard the voice of the lad and the angel of god calledto hagar out of heaven and said unto her what aileth thee hagarfear not for god hath heard the voice of the lad where he is arise lift up the lad and hold him in thine hand for i willmake him a great nation and god opened her eyes and she saw a well of water and shewent and filled the bottle with water and gave the lad drink and god was with the lad and he grew and dwelt in thewilderness and became an archer and he dwelt in the wilderness of paran and his mother took hima wife out of the land of egypt and it came to pass at that time that abimelech and phichol thechief captain of his host spake unto abraham saying god is with theein all that thou doest  now therefore swear unto me here by godthat thou wilt not deal falsely with me nor with my son nor with mysons son but according to the kindness that i have done unto theethou shalt do unto me and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned and abraham said i will swear and abraham reproved abimelech because of a well of water whichabimelechs servants had violently taken away and abimelech said i wot not who hath done this thing neitherdidst thou tell me neither yet heard i of it but to day and abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them unto abimelechand both of them made a covenant and abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves and abimelech said unto abraham what mean these seven ewe lambswhich thou hast set by themselves   and he said for these sevenewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand that they may be a witness untome that i have digged this well wherefore he called that place beersheba because there theysware both of them thus they made a covenant at beersheba then abimelech rose upand phichol the chief captain of his host and they returned into theland of the philistines and abraham planted a grove in beersheba and called there onthe name of the lord the everlasting god and abraham sojourned in the philistines land many days and it came to pass after these things that god did temptabraham and said unto him abraham and he said behold here i am and he said take now thy son thine only son isaac whom thoulovest and get thee into the land of moriah and offer him there fora burnt offering upon one of the mountains which i will tell thee of and abraham rose up early in the morning and saddled his assand took two of his young men with him and isaac his son and clavethe wood for the burnt offering and rose up and went unto the placeof which god had told him then on the third day abraham lifted up his eyes and saw theplace afar off and abraham said unto his young men abide ye here with the assand i and the lad will go yonder and worship and come again to you and abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it uponisaac his son and he took the fire in his hand and a knife and theywent both of them together and isaac spake unto abraham his father and said my father andhe said here am i my son and he said behold the fire and the woodbut where is the lamb for a burnt offering   and abraham said myson god will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering so theywent both of them together and they came to the place which god had told him of and abrahambuilt an altar there and laid the wood in order and bound isaac hisson and laid him on the altar upon the wood and abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slayhis son and the angel of the lord called unto him out of heaven andsaid abraham abraham and he said here am i and he said lay not thine hand upon the lad neither do thouany thing unto him for now i know that thou fearest god seeing thouhast not withheld thy son thine only son from me and abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and behold behindhim a ram caught in a thicket by his horns and abraham went and tookthe ram and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of hisson and abraham called the name of that place jehovahjireh as it issaid to this day in the mount of the lord it shall be seen and the angel of the lord called unto abraham out of heaven thesecond time  and said by myself have i sworn saith the lordfor because thou hast done this thing and hast not withheld thy sonthine only son  that in blessing i will bless thee and inmultiplying i will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven andas the sand which is upon the sea shore and thy seed shall possessthe gate of his enemies  and in thy seed shall all the nationsof the earth be blessed because thou hast obeyed my voice so abraham returned unto his young men and they rose up andwent together to beersheba and abraham dwelt at beersheba and it came to pass after these things that it was toldabraham saying behold milcah she hath also born children unto thybrother nahor  huz his firstborn and buz his brother andkemuel the father of aram  and chesed and hazo and pildashand jidlaph and bethuel and bethuel begat rebekah these eight milcah did bear to nahorabrahams brother and his concubine whose name was reumah she bare also tebahand gaham and thahash and maachah and sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old thesewere the years of the life of sarah and sarah died in kirjatharba the same is hebron in the land ofcanaan and abraham came to mourn for sarah and to weep for her and abraham stood up from before his dead and spake unto thesons of heth saying  i am a stranger and a sojourner with yougive me a possession of a buryingplace with you that i may bury mydead out of my sight and the children of heth answered abraham saying unto him hear us my lord thou art a mighty prince among us in the choice ofour sepulchres bury thy dead none of us shall withhold from thee hissepulchre but that thou mayest bury thy dead and abraham

rebekah is before thee take her and go and let her bethy masters sons wife as the lord hath spoken and it came to pass that when abrahams servant heard theirwords he worshipped the lord bowing himself to the earth and the servant brought forth jewels of silver and jewels ofgold and raiment and gave them to rebekah he gave also to herbrother and to her mother precious things and they did eat and drink he and the men that were with himand tarried all night and they rose up in the morning and he saidsend me away unto my master and her brother and her mother said let the damsel abide withus a few days at the least ten after that she shall go and he said unto them hinder me not seeing the lord hathprospered my way send me away that i may go to my master and they said we will call the damsel and enquire at hermouth and they called rebekah and said unto her wilt thou go withthis man and she said i will go and they sent away rebekah their sister and her nurse andabrahams servant and his men and they blessed rebekah and said unto her thou art oursister be thou the mother of thousands of millions and let thy seedpossess the gate of those which hate them and rebekah arose and her damsels and they rode upon thecamels and followed the man and the servant took rebekah and wenthis way and isaac came from the way of the well lahairoi for he dweltin the south country and isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide andhe lifted up his eyes and saw and behold the camels were coming and rebekah lifted up her eyes and when she saw isaac shelighted off the camel for she had said unto the servant what man is this that walkethin the field to meet us and the servant had said it is my mastertherefore she took a vail and covered herself and the servant told isaac all things that he had done and isaac brought her into his mother sarahs tent and tookrebekah and she became his wife and he loved her and isaac wascomforted after his mothers death then again abraham took a wife and her name was keturah and she bare him zimran and jokshan and medan and midian andishbak and shuah and jokshan begat sheba and dedan and the sons of dedan wereasshurim and letushim and leummim and the sons of midian ephah and epher and hanoch and abidahand eldaah all these were the children of keturah and abraham gave all that he had unto isaac but unto the sons of the concubines which abraham had abrahamgave gifts and sent them away from isaac his son while he yet livedeastward unto the east country and these are the days of the years of abrahams life which helived an hundred threescore and fifteen years then abraham gave up the ghost and died in a good old age anold man and full of years and was gathered to his people and his sons isaac and ishmael buried him in the cave ofmachpelah in the field of ephron the son of zohar the hittite whichis before mamre  the field which abraham purchased of the sonsof heth there was abraham buried and sarah his wife and it came to pass after the death of abraham that god blessedhis son isaac and isaac dwelt by the well lahairoi now these are the generations of ishmael abrahams son whomhagar the egyptian sarahs handmaid bare unto abraham  andthese are the names of the sons of ishmael by their names accordingto their generations the firstborn of ishmael nebajoth and kedarand adbeel and mibsam  and mishma and dumah and massa hadar and tema jetur naphish and kedemah  these are the sonsof ishmael and these are their names by their towns and by theircastles twelve princes according to their nations and these are the years of the life of ishmael an hundred andthirty and seven years and he gave up the ghost and died and wasgathered unto his people and they dwelt from havilah unto shur that is before egypt asthou goest toward assyria and he died in the presence of all hisbrethren and these are the generations of isaac abrahams son abrahambegat isaac  and isaac was forty years old when he took rebekahto wife the daughter of bethuel the syrian of padanaram the sisterto laban the syrian and isaac intreated the lord for his wife because she wasbarren and the lord was intreated of him and rebekah his wifeconceived and the children struggled together within her and she said ifit be so why am i thus and she went to enquire of the lord and the lord said unto her two nations are in thy womb and twomanner of people shall be separated from thy bowels and the onepeople shall be stronger than the other people and the elder shallserve the younger and when her days to be delivered were fulfilled behold therewere twins in her womb and the first came out red all over like an hairy garment andthey called his name esau and after that came his brother out and his hand took hold onesaus heel and his name was called jacob and isaac was threescoreyears old when she bare them and the boys grew and esau was a cunning hunter a man of thefield and jacob was a plain man dwelling in tents and isaac loved esau because he did eat of his venison butrebekah loved jacob and jacob sod pottage and esau came from the field and he wasfaint  and esau said to jacob feed me i pray thee with thatsame red pottage for i am faint therefore was his name called edom and jacob said sell me this day thy birthright and esau said behold i am at the point to die and what profitshall this birthright do to me   and jacob said swear to methis day and he sware unto him and he sold his birthright untojacob then jacob gave esau bread and pottage of lentiles and he dideat and drink and rose up and went his way thus esau despised hisbirthright and there was a famine in the land beside the first famine thatwas in the days of abraham and isaac went unto abimelech king of thephilistines unto gerar and the lord appeared unto him and said go not down into egyptdwell in the land which i shall tell thee of  sojourn in thisland and i will be with thee and will bless thee for unto thee andunto thy seed i will give all these countries and i will perform theoath which i sware unto abraham thy father  and i will make thyseed to multiply as the stars of heaven and will give unto thy seedall these countries and in thy seed shall all the nations of theearth be blessed  because that abraham obeyed my voice and keptmy charge my commandments my statutes and my laws and isaac dwelt in gerar  and the men of the place asked himof his wife and he said she is my sister for he feared to say sheis my wife lest said he the men of the place should kill me forrebekah because she was fair to look upon and it came to pass when he had been there a long time thatabimelech king of the philistines looked out at a window and sawand behold isaac was sporting with rebekah his wife and abimelech called isaac and said behold of a surety she isthy wife and how saidst thou she is my sister and isaac said untohim because i said lest i die for her and abimelech said what is this thou hast done unto us one ofthe people might lightly have lien with thy wife and thou shouldesthave brought guiltiness upon us and abimelech charged all his people saying he that toucheththis man or his wife shall surely be put to death then isaac sowed in that land and received in the same year anhundredfold and the lord blessed him and the man waxed great and went forward and grew until hebecame very great  for he had possession of flocks andpossession of herds and great store of servants and the philistinesenvied him for all the wells which his fathers servants had digged in thedays of abraham his father the philistines had stopped them andfilled them with earth and abimelech said unto isaac go from us for thou art muchmightier than we and isaac departed thence and pitched his tent in the valley ofgerar and dwelt there and isaac digged again the wells of water which they had diggedin the days of abraham his father for the philistines had stoppedthem after the death of abraham and he called their names after thenames by which his father had called them and isaacs servants digged in the valley and found there awell of springing water and the herdmen of gerar did strive with isaacs herdmensaying the water is ours and he called the name of the well esekbecause they strove with him and they digged another well and strove for that also and hecalled the name of it sitnah and he removed from thence and digged another well and forthat they strove not and he called the name of it rehoboth and hesaid for now the lord hath made room for us and we shall be fruitfulin the land and he went up from thence to beersheba and the lord appeared unto him the same night and said i amthe god of abraham thy father fear not for i am with thee and willbless thee and multiply thy seed for my servant abrahams sake and he builded an altar there and called upon the name of thelord and pitched his tent there and there isaacs servants digged awell then abimelech went to him from gerar and ahuzzath one of hisfriends and phichol the chief captain of his army and isaac said unto them wherefore come ye to me seeing yehate me and have sent me away from you   and they said we sawcertainly that the lord was with thee and we said let there be nowan oath betwixt us even betwixt us and thee and let us make acovenant with thee  that thou wilt do us no hurt as we have nottouched thee and as we have done unto thee nothing but good and havesent thee away in peace thou art now the blessed of the lord and he made them a feast and they did eat and drink and they rose up betimes in the morning and sware one toanother and isaac sent them away and they departed from him inpeace and it came to pass the same day that isaacs servants cameand told him concerning the well which they had digged and said untohim we have found water and he called it shebah therefore the name of the city isbeersheba unto this day and esau was forty years old when he took to wife judith thedaughter of beeri the hittite and bashemath the daughter of elon thehittite  which were a grief of mind unto isaac and to rebekah and it came to pass that when isaac was old and his eyes weredim so that he could not see he called esau his eldest son and saidunto him my son and he said unto him behold here am i and he said behold now i am old i know not the day of mydeath  now therefore take i pray thee thy weapons thy quiverand thy bow and go out to the field and take me some venison and make me savoury meat such as i love and bring it to me that imay eat that my soul may bless thee before i die and rebekah heard when isaac spake to esau his son and esau wentto the field to hunt for venison and to bring it and rebekah spake unto jacob her son saying behold i heard thyfather speak unto esau thy brother saying  bring me venison andmake me savoury meat that i may eat and bless thee before the lordbefore my death now therefore my son obey my voice according to that which icommand thee go now to the flock and fetch me from thence two good kids ofthe goats and i will make them savoury meat for thy father such ashe loveth  and thou shalt bring it to thy father that he mayeat and that he may bless thee before his death and jacob said to rebekah his mother behold esau my brother isa hairy man and i am a smooth man  my father peradventure willfeel me and i shall seem to him as a deceiver and i shall bring acurse upon me and not a blessing and his mother said unto him upon me be thy curse my son onlyobey my voice and go fetch me them and he went and fetched and brought them to his mother andhis mother made savoury meat such as his father loved and rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son esau whichwere with her in the house and put them upon jacob her younger son and she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his handsand upon the smooth of his neck  and she gave the savoury meatand the bread which she had prepared into the hand of her son jacob and he came unto his father and said my father and he saidhere am i who art thou my son   and jacob said unto hisfather i am esau thy first born i have done according as thou badestme arise i pray thee sit and eat of my venison that thy soul maybless me and isaac said unto his son how is it that thou hast found itso quickly my son and he said because the lord thy god brought itto me and isaac said unto jacob come near i pray thee that i mayfeel thee my son whether thou be my very son esau or not and jacob went near unto isaac his father and he felt him andsaid the voice is jacobs voice but the hands are the hands of esau and he discerned him not because his hands were hairy as hisbrother esaus hands so he blessed him and he said art thou my very son esau and he said i am and he said bring it near to me and i will eat of my sonsvenison that my soul may bless thee and he brought it near to himand he did eat and he brought him wine and he drank and his father isaac said unto him come near now and kiss memy son and he came near and kissed him and he smelled the smell ofhis raiment and blessed him and said see the smell of my son is asthe smell of a field which the lord hath blessed  therefore godgive thee of the dew of heaven and the fatness of the earth andplenty of corn and wine  let people serve thee and nations bowdown to thee be lord over thy brethren and let thy mothers sons bowdown to thee cursed be every one that curseth thee and blessed be hethat blesseth thee and it came to pass as soon as isaac had made an end ofblessing jacob and jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence ofisaac his father that esau his brother came in from his hunting and he also had made savoury meat and brought it unto hisfather and said unto his father let my father arise and eat of hissons venison that thy soul may bless me and isaac his father said unto him who art thou and he said iam thy son thy firstborn esau and isaac trembled very exceedingly and said who where is hethat hath taken venison and brought it me and i have eaten of allbefore thou camest and have blessed him yea and he shall beblessed and when esau heard the words of his father he cried with agreat and exceeding bitter cry and said unto his father bless meeven me also o my father and he said thy brother came with subtilty and hath taken awaythy blessing and he said is not he rightly named jacob for he hathsupplanted me these two times he took away my birthright andbehold now he hath taken away my blessing and he said hast thou notreserved a blessing for me   and isaac answered and said untoesau behold i have made him thy lord and all his brethren have igiven to him for servants and with corn and wine have i sustainedhim and what shall i do now unto thee my son   and esau saidunto his father hast thou but one blessing my father bless me evenme also o my father and esau lifted up his voice and wept and isaac his father answered and said unto him behold thydwelling shall be the fatness of the earth and of the dew of heavenfrom above  and by thy sword shalt thou live and shalt servethy brother and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have thedominion that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck and esau hated jacob because of the blessing wherewith hisfather blessed him and esau said in his heart the days of mourningfor my father are at hand then will i slay my brother jacob and these words of esau her elder son were told to rebekah andshe sent and called jacob her younger son and said unto him beholdthy brother esau as touching thee doth comfort himself purposing tokill thee now therefore my son obey my voice arise flee thou to labanmy brother to haran  and tarry with him a few days until thybrothers fury turn away  until thy brothers anger turn awayfrom thee and he forget that which thou hast done to him then i willsend and fetch thee from thence why should i be deprived also of youboth in one day   and rebekah said to isaac i am weary of mylife because of the daughters of heth if jacob take a wife of thedaughters of heth such as these which are of the daughters of theland what good shall my life do me   and isaac called jacob andblessed him and charged him and said unto him thou shalt not take awife of the daughters of canaan arise go to padanaram to the house of bethuel thy mothersfather and take thee a wife from thence of the daughers of laban thymothers brother and god almighty bless thee and make thee fruitful and multiplythee that thou mayest be a multitude of people  and give theethe blessing of abraham to thee and to thy seed with thee that thoumayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger which god gaveunto abraham and isaac sent away jacob and he went to padanaram unto labanson of bethuel the syrian the brother of rebekah jacobs and esausmother when esau saw that isaac had blessed jacob and sent him away topadanaram to take him a wife from thence and that as he blessed himhe gave him a charge saying thou shalt not take a wife of thedaughers of canaan  and that jacob obeyed his father and hismother and was gone to padanaram  and esau seeing that thedaughters of canaan pleased not isaac his father  then went esauunto ishmael and took unto the wives which he had mahalath thedaughter of ishmael abrahams son the sister of nebajoth to be hiswife and jacob went out from beersheba and went toward haran and he lighted upon a certain place and tarried there allnight because the sun was set and he took of the stones of thatplace and put them for his pillows and lay down in that place tosleep and he dreamed and behold a ladder set up on the earth and thetop of it reached to heaven and behold the angels of god ascendingand descending on it and behold the lord stood above it and said i am the lordgod of abraham thy father and the god of isaac the land whereon thouliest to thee will i give it and to thy seed  and thy seedshall be as the dust of the earth and thou shalt spread abroad to thewest and to the east and to the north and to the south and in theeand in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed and behold i am with thee and will keep thee in all placeswhither thou goest and will bring thee again into this land for iwill not leave thee until i have done that which i have spoken tothee of and jacob awaked out of his sleep and he said surely the lordis in this place and i knew it not and he was afraid and said how dreadful is this place this isnone other but the house of god and this is the gate of heaven and jacob rose up early in the morning and took the stone thathe had put for his pillows and set it up for a pillar and poured oilupon the top of it and he called the name of that place bethel but the name ofthat city was called luz at the first and jacob vowed a vow saying if god will be with me and willkeep me in this way that i go and will give me bread to eat andraiment to put on  so that i come again to my fathers house inpeace then shall the lord be my god  and this stone which ihave set for a pillar shall be gods house and of all that thoushalt give me i will surely give the tenth unto thee then jacob went on his journey and came into the land of thepeople of the east and he looked and behold a well in the field and lo therewere three flocks of sheep lying by it for out of that well theywatered the flocks and a great stone was upon the wells mouth and thither were all the flocks gathered and they rolled thestone from the wells mouth and watered the sheep and put the stoneagain upon the wells mouth in his place and jacob said unto them my brethren whence be ye and theysaid of haran are we and he said unto them know ye laban the son of nahor and theysaid we know him and he said unto them is he well and they said he is welland behold rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep and he said lo it is yet high day neither is it time that thecattle should be gathered together water ye the sheep and go andfeed them and they said we cannot until all the flocks be gatheredtogether and till they roll the stone from the wells mouth then wewater the sheep and while he yet spake with them rachel came with her fatherssheep for she kept them and it came to pass when jacob saw rachel the daughter of labanhis mothers brother and the sheep of laban his mothers brotherthat jacob went near and rolled the stone from the wells mouth andwatered the flock of laban his mothers brother and jacob kissed rachel and lifted up his voice and wept and jacob told rachel that he was her fathers brother and thathe was rebekahs son and she ran and told her father and it came to pass when laban heard the tidings of jacob hissisters son that he ran to meet him and embraced him and kissedhim and brought him to his house and he told laban all these things and laban said to him surely thou art my bone and my flesh andhe abode with him the space of a month and laban said unto jacob because thou art my brothershouldest thou therefore serve me for nought tell me what shall thywages be   and laban had two daughters the name of the elderwas leah and the name of the younger was rachel leah was tender eyed but rachel was beautiful and wellfavoured and jacob loved rachel and said i will serve thee seven yearsfor rachel thy younger daughter and laban said it is better that i give her to thee than thati should give her to another man abide with me and jacob served seven years for rachel and they seemed untohim but a few days for the love he had to her and jacob said unto laban give me my wife for my days arefulfilled that i may go in unto her and laban gathered together all the men of the place and made afeast and it came to pass in the evening that he took leah hisdaughter and brought her to him and he went in unto her and laban gave unto his daughter leah zilpah his maid for anhandmaid and it came to pass that in the morning behold it was leahand he said to laban what is this thou hast done unto me did not iserve with thee for rachel wherefore then hast thou beguiled me and laban said it must not be so done in our country to givethe younger before the firstborn fulfil her week and we will give thee this also for the servicewhich thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years and jacob did so and fulfilled her week and he gave him rachelhis daughter to wife also and laban gave to rachel his daughter bilhah his handmaid to beher maid and he went in also unto rachel and he loved also rachel morethan leah and served with him yet seven other years and when the lord saw that leah was hated he opened her wombbut rachel was barren and leah conceived and bare a son and she called his

multitude and the lord hath blessed thee since mycoming and now when shall i provide for mine own house also  and he said what shall i give thee and jacob said thou shalt notgive me any thing if thou wilt do this thing for me i will againfeed and keep thy flock i will pass through all thy flock to day removing from thenceall the speckled and spotted cattle and all the brown cattle amongthe sheep and the spotted and speckled among the goats and of suchshall be my hire so shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come when itshall come for my hire before thy face every one that is not speckledand spotted among the goats and brown among the sheep that shall becounted stolen with me and laban said behold i would it might be according to thyword and he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked andspotted and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted andevery one that had some white in it and all the brown among thesheep and gave them into the hand of his sons and he set three days journey betwixt himself and jacob andjacob fed the rest of labans flocks and jacob took him rods of green poplar and of the hazel andchesnut tree and pilled white strakes in them and made the whiteappear which was in the rods and he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in thegutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink thatthey should conceive when they came to drink and the flocks conceived before the rods and brought forthcattle ringstraked speckled and spotted and jacob did separate the lambs and set the faces of theflocks toward the ringstraked and all the brown in the flock oflaban and he put his own flocks by themselves and put them not untolabans cattle and it came to pass whensoever the stronger cattle didconceive that jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle inthe gutters that they might conceive among the rods but when the cattle were feeble he put them not in so thefeebler were labans and the stronger jacobs and the man increased exceedingly and had much cattle andmaidservants and menservants and camels and asses and he heard the words of labans sons saying jacob hath takenaway all that was our fathers and of that which was our fathershath he gotten all this glory and jacob beheld the countenance of laban and behold it wasnot toward him as before and the lord said unto jacob return unto the land of thyfathers and to thy kindred and i will be with thee and jacob sent and called rachel and leah to the field unto hisflock  and said unto them i see your fathers countenance thatit is not toward me as before but the god of my father hath been withme and ye know that with all my power i have served your father and your father hath deceived me and changed my wages ten timesbut god suffered him not to hurt me if he said thus the speckled shall be thy wages then all thecattle bare speckled and if he said thus the ringstraked shall bethy hire then bare all the cattle ringstraked thus god hath taken away the cattle of your father and giventhem to me and it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived thati lifted up mine eyes and saw in a dream and behold the rams whichleaped upon the cattle were ringstraked speckled and grisled and the angel of god spake unto me in a dream saying jacoband i said here am i and he said lift up now thine eyes and see all the rams whichleap upon the cattle are ringstraked speckled and grisled for ihave seen all that laban doeth unto thee i am the god of bethel where thou anointedst the pillar andwhere thou vowedst a vow unto me now arise get thee out from thisland and return unto the land of thy kindred and rachel and leah answered and said unto him is there yet anyportion or inheritance for us in our fathers house   are we notcounted of him strangers for he hath sold us and hath quite devouredalso our money for all the riches which god hath taken from our father that isours and our childrens now then whatsoever god hath said untothee do then jacob rose up and set his sons and his wives upon camels and he carried away all his cattle and all his goods which hehad gotten the cattle of his getting which he had gotten inpadanaram for to go to isaac his father in the land of canaan and laban went to shear his sheep and rachel had stolen theimages that were her fathers and jacob stole away unawares to laban the syrian in that hetold him not that he fled so he fled with all that he had and he rose up and passed overthe river and set his face toward the mount gilead and it was told laban on the third day that jacob was fled and he took his brethren with him and pursued after him sevendays journey and they overtook him in the mount gilead and god came to laban the syrian in a dream by night and saidunto him take heed that thou speak not to jacob either good or bad then laban overtook jacob now jacob had pitched his tent in themount and laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of gilead and laban said to jacob what hast thou done that thou haststolen away unawares to me and carried away my daughters as captivestaken with the sword   wherefore didst thou flee away secretlyand steal away from me and didst not tell me that i might have sentthee away with mirth and with songs with tabret and with harp and hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters thouhast now done foolishly in so doing it is in the power of my hand to do you hurt but the god ofyour father spake unto me yesternight saying take thou heed thatthou speak not to jacob either good or bad and now though thou wouldest needs be gone because thou sorelongedst after thy fathers house yet wherefore hast thou stolen mygods   and jacob answered and said to laban because i wasafraid for i said peradventure thou wouldest take by force thydaughters from me with whomsoever thou findest thy gods let him not live beforeour brethren discern thou what is thine with me and take it to theefor jacob knew not that rachel had stolen them and laban went into jacobs tent and into leahs tent and intothe two maidservants tents but he found them not then went he outof leahs tent and entered into rachels tent now rachel had taken the images and put them in the camelsfurniture and sat upon them and laban searched all the tent butfound them not and she said to her father let it not displease my lord that icannot rise up before thee for the custom of women is upon me and hesearched but found not the images and jacob was wroth and chode with laban and jacob answeredand said to laban what is my trespass what is my sin that thou hastso hotly pursued after me   whereas thou hast searched all mystuff what hast thou found of all thy household stuff set it herebefore my brethren and thy brethren that they may judge betwixt usboth this twenty years have i been with thee thy ewes and thy shegoats have not cast their young and the rams of thy flock have i noteaten that which was torn of beasts i brought not unto thee i barethe loss of it of my hand didst thou require it whether stolen byday or stolen by night thus i was in the day the drought consumed me and the frost bynight and my sleep departed from mine eyes thus have i been twenty years in thy house i served theefourteen years for thy two daughters and six years for thy cattleand thou hast changed my wages ten times except the god of my father the god of abraham and the fear ofisaac had been with me surely thou hadst sent me away now empty godhath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands and rebuked theeyesternight and laban answered and said unto jacob these daughters are mydaughters and these children are my children and these cattle are mycattle and all that thou seest is mine and what can i do this dayunto these my daughters or unto their children which they have born now therefore come thou let us make a covenant i and thou andlet it be for a witness between me and thee and jacob took a stone and set it up for a pillar and jacob said unto his brethren gather stones and they tookstones and made an heap and they did eat there upon the heap and laban called it jegarsahadutha but jacob called it galeed and laban said this heap is a witness between me and thee thisdaytherefore was the name of it called galeed  and mizpah for hesaid the lord watch between me and thee when we are absent one fromanother if thou shalt afflict my daughters or if thou shalt take otherwives beside my daughters no man is with us see god is witnessbetwixt me and thee and laban said to jacob behold this heap and behold thispillar which i have cast betwixt me and thee  this heap bewitness and this pillar be witness that i will not pass over thisheap to thee and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and thispillar unto me for harm the god of abraham and the god of nahor the god of theirfather judge betwixt us and jacob sware by the fear of his fatherisaac then jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount and called hisbrethren to eat bread and they did eat bread and tarried all nightin the mount and early in the morning laban rose up and kissed his sons andhis daughters and blessed them and laban departed and returned untohis place and jacob went on his way and the angels of god met him and when jacob saw them he said this is gods host and hecalled the name of that place mahanaim and jacob sent messengers before him to esau his brother unto theland of seir the country of edom and he commanded them saying thus shall ye speak unto my lordesau thy servant jacob saith thus i have sojourned with laban andstayed there until now  and i have oxen and asses flocks andmenservants and womenservants and i have sent to tell my lord thati may find grace in thy sight and the messengers returned to jacob saying we came to thybrother esau and also he cometh to meet thee and four hundred menwith him then jacob was greatly afraid and distressed and he divided thepeople that was with him and the flocks and herds and the camelsinto two bands  and said if esau come to the one company andsmite it then the other company which is left shall escape and jacob said o god of my father abraham and god of my fatherisaac the lord which saidst unto me return unto thy country and tothy kindred and i will deal well with thee  i am not worthy ofthe least of all the mercies and of all the truth which thou hastshewed unto thy servant for with my staff i passed over this jordanand now i am become two bands deliver me i pray thee from the hand of my brother from thehand of esau for i fear him lest he will come and smite me and themother with the children and thou saidst i will surely do thee good and make thy seedas the sand of the sea which cannot be numbered for multitude and he lodged there that same night and took of that which cameto his hand a present for esau his brother  two hundred shegoats and twenty he goats two hundred ewes and twenty rams thirty milch camels with their colts forty kine and ten bullstwenty she asses and ten foals and he delivered them into the hand of his servants every droveby themselves and said unto his servants pass over before me andput a space betwixt drove and drove and he commanded the foremost saying when esau my brothermeeteth thee and asketh thee saying whose art thou and whithergoest thou and whose are these before thee   then thou shaltsay they be thy servant jacobs it is a present sent unto my lordesau and behold also he is behind us and so commanded he the second and the third and all thatfollowed the droves saying on this manner shall ye speak unto esauwhen ye find him and say ye moreover behold thy servant jacob is behind us forhe said i will appease him with the present that goeth before me andafterward i will see his face peradventure he will accept of me so went the present over before him and himself lodged thatnight in the company and he rose up that night and took his two wives and his twowomenservants and his eleven sons and passed over the ford jabbok and he took them and sent them over the brook and sent overthat he had and jacob was left alone and there wrestled a man with himuntil the breaking of the day and when he saw that he prevailed not against him he touchedthe hollow of his thigh and the hollow of jacobs thigh was out ofjoint as he wrestled with him and he said let me go for the day breaketh and he said iwill not let thee go except thou bless me and he said unto him what is thy name and he said jacob and he said thy name shall be called no more jacob but israelfor as a prince hast thou power with god and with men and hastprevailed and jacob asked him and said tell me i pray thee thy nameand he said wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name and heblessed him there and jacob called the name of the place peniel for i have seengod face to face and my life is preserved and as he passed over penuel the sun rose upon him and hehalted upon his thigh therefore the children of israel eat not of the sinew whichshrank which is upon the hollow of the thigh unto this day becausehe touched the hollow of jacobs thigh in the sinew that shrank and jacob lifted up his eyes and looked and behold esau cameand with him four hundred men and he divided the children unto leahand unto rachel and unto the two handmaids and he put the handmaids and their children foremost and leahand her children after and rachel and joseph hindermost and he passed over before them and bowed himself to the groundseven times until he came near to his brother and esau ran to meet him and embraced him and fell on his neckand kissed him and they wept and he lifted up his eyes and saw the women and the childrenand said who are those with thee and he said the children which godhath graciously given thy servant then the handmaidens came near they and their children and theybowed themselves and leah also with her children came near and bowed themselvesand after came joseph near and rachel and they bowed themselves and he said what meanest thou by all this drove which i met andhe said these are to find grace in the sight of my lord and esau said i have enough my brother keep that thou hastunto thyself and jacob said nay i pray thee if now i have found grace inthy sight then receive my present at my hand for therefore i haveseen thy face as though i had seen the face of god and thou wastpleased with me take i pray thee my blessing that is brought to thee becausegod hath dealt graciously with me and because i have enough and heurged him and he took it and he said let us take our journey and let us go and i willgo before thee and he said unto him my lord knoweth that the children aretender and the flocks and herds with young are with me and if menshould overdrive them one day all the flock will die let my lord i pray thee pass over before his servant and iwill lead on softly according as the cattle that goeth before me andthe children be able to endure until i come unto my lord unto seir and esau said let me now leave with thee some of the folk thatare with me and he said what needeth it let me find grace in thesight of my lord so esau returned that day on his way unto seir and jacob journeyed to succoth and built him an house and madebooths for his cattle therefore the name of the place is calledsuccoth and jacob came to shalem a city of shechem which is in theland of canaan when he came from padanaram and pitched his tentbefore the city and he bought a parcel of a field where he had spread his tentat the hand of the children of hamor shechems father for an hundredpieces of money and he erected there an altar and called it eleloheisrael and dinah the daughter of leah which she bare unto jacob wentout to see the daughters of the land and when shechem the son of hamor the hivite prince of thecountry saw her he took her and lay with her and defiled her and his soul clave unto dinah the daughter of jacob and he lovedthe damsel and spake kindly unto the damsel and shechem spake unto his father hamor saying get me thisdamsel to wife and jacob heard that he had defiled dinah his daughter now hissons were with his cattle in the field and jacob held his peace untilthey were come and hamor the father of shechem went out unto jacob to communewith him and the sons of jacob came out of the field when they heard itand the men were grieved and they were very wroth because he hadwrought folly in israel in lying with jacobs daughter which thingought not to be done and hamor communed with them saying the soul of my son shechemlongeth for your daughter i pray you give her him to wife and make ye marriages with us and give your daughters unto usand take our daughters unto you and ye shall dwell with us and the land shall be before youdwell and trade ye therein and get you possessions therein and shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren let mefind grace in your eyes and what ye shall say unto me i will give ask me never so much dowry and gift and i will give accordingas ye shall say unto me but give me the damsel to wife and the sons of jacob answered shechem and hamor his fatherdeceitfully and said because he had defiled dinah their sister and they said unto them we cannot do this thing to give oursister to one that is uncircumcised for that were a reproach unto us but in this will we consent unto you if ye will be as we bethat every male of you be circumcised  then will we give ourdaughters unto you and we will take your daughters to us and we willdwell with you and we will become one people but if ye will not hearken unto us to be circumcised then willwe take our daughter and we will be gone and their words pleased hamor and shechem hamors son and the young man deferred not to do the thing because he haddelight in jacobs daughter and he was more honourable than all thehouse of his father and hamor and shechem his son came unto the gate of their cityand communed with the men of their city saying  these men arepeaceable with us therefore let them dwell in the land and tradetherein for the land behold it is large enough for them let ustake their daughters to us for wives and let us give them ourdaughters only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with usto be one people if every male among us be circumcised as they arecircumcised shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast oftheirs be ours only let us consent unto them and they will dwellwith us and unto hamor and unto shechem his son hearkened all that wentout of the gate of his city and every male was circumcised all thatwent out of the gate of his city and it came to pass on the third day when they were sore thattwo of the sons of jacob simeon and levi dinahs brethren took eachman his sword and came upon the city boldly and slew all the males and they slew hamor and shechem his son with the edge of thesword and took dinah out of shechems house and went out the sons of jacob came upon the slain and spoiled the citybecause they had defiled their sister they took their sheep and their oxen and their asses and thatwhich was in the city and that which was in the field  and alltheir wealth and all their little ones and their wives took theycaptive and spoiled even all that was in the house and jacob said to simeon and levi ye have troubled me to makeme to stink among the inhabitants of the land among the canaanitesand the perizzites and i being few in number they shall gatherthemselves together against me and slay me and i shall be destroyedi and my house and they said should he deal with our sister as with an harlot and god said unto jacob arise go up to bethel and dwell thereand make there an altar unto god that appeared unto thee when thoufleddest from the face of esau thy brother then jacob said unto his household and to all that were withhim put away the strange gods that are among you and be clean andchange your garments  and let us arise and go up to bethel andi will make there an altar unto god who answered me in the day of mydistress and was with me in the way which i went and they gave unto jacob all the strange gods which were in theirhand and all their earrings which were in their ears and jacob hidthem under the oak which was by shechem and they journeyed and the terror of god was upon the citiesthat were round about them and they did not pursue after the sons ofjacob so jacob came to luz which is in the land of canaan that isbethel he and all the people that were with him and he built there an altar and called the place elbethelbecause there god appeared unto him when he fled from the face of hisbrother but deborah rebekahs nurse died and she was buried beneathbethel under an oak and the name of it was called allonbachuth and god appeared unto jacob again when he came out of padanaramand blessed him and god said unto him thy name is jacob thy name shall not becalled any more jacob but israel shall be thy name and he called hisname israel and god said unto him i am god almighty be fruitful andmultiply a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee andkings shall come out of thy loins  and the land which i gaveabraham and isaac to thee i will give it and to thy seed after theewill i give the land and god went up from him in the place where he talked with him and jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with himeven a pillar of stone and he poured a drink offering thereon and hepoured oil thereon and jacob called the name of the place where god spake with himbethel and they journeyed from bethel and there was but a little wayto come to ephrath and rachel travailed and she had hard labour and it came to pass when she was in hard labour that themidwife said unto her fear not thou shalt have this son also and it came to pass as her soul was in departing for shedied that she called his name benoni but his father called himbenjamin and rachel died and was buried in the way to ephrath which isbethlehem and jacob set a pillar upon her grave that is the pillar ofrachels

his brethren and the lad was with thesons of bilhah and with the sons of zilpah his fathers wives andjoseph brought unto his father their evil report now israel loved joseph more than all his children because hewas the son of his old age and he made him a coat of many colours and when his brethren saw that their father loved him more thanall his brethren they hated him and could not speak peaceably untohim and joseph dreamed a dream and he told it his brethren and theyhated him yet the more and he said unto them hear i pray you this dream which i havedreamed  for behold we were binding sheaves in the field andlo my sheaf arose and also stood upright and behold your sheavesstood round about and made obeisance to my sheaf and his brethren said to him shalt thou indeed reign over us orshalt thou indeed have dominion over us and they hated him yet themore for his dreams and for his words and he dreamed yet another dream and told it his brethren andsaid behold i have dreamed a dream more and behold the sun andthe moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me and he told it to his father and to his brethren and hisfather rebuked him and said unto him what is this dream that thouhast dreamed  shall i and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come tobow down ourselves to thee to the earth   and his brethrenenvied him but his father observed the saying and his brethren went to feed their fathers flock in shechem and israel said unto joseph do not thy brethren feed the flockin shechem come and i will send thee unto them and he said to himhere am i and he said to him go i pray thee see whether it be well withthy brethren and well with the flocks and bring me word again so hesent him out of the vale of hebron and he came to shechem and a certain man found him and behold he was wandering inthe field and the man asked him saying what seekest thou  and he said i seek my brethren tell me i pray thee where they feedtheir flocks and the man said they are departed hence for i heard them saylet us go to dothan and joseph went after his brethren and foundthem in dothan and when they saw him afar off even before he came near untothem they conspired against him to slay him and they said one to another behold this dreamer cometh come now therefore and let us slay him and cast him into somepit and we will say some evil beast hath devoured him and we shallsee what will become of his dreams and reuben heard it and he delivered him out of their handsand said let us not kill him and reuben said unto them shed no blood but cast him into thispit that is in the wilderness and lay no hand upon him that he mightrid him out of their hands to deliver him to his father again and it came to pass when joseph was come unto his brethrenthat they stript joseph out of his coat his coat of many colours thatwas on him  and they took him and cast him into a pit and thepit was empty there was no water in it and they sat down to eat bread and they lifted up their eyesand looked and behold a company of ishmeelites came from gileadwith their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh going to carryit down to egypt and judah said unto his brethren what profit is it if we slayour brother and conceal his blood   come and let us sell himto the ishmeelites and let not our hand be upon him for he is ourbrother and our flesh and his brethren were content then there passed by midianites merchantmen and they drew andlifted up joseph out of the pit and sold joseph to the ishmeelitesfor twenty pieces of silver and they brought joseph into egypt and reuben returned unto the pit and behold joseph was not inthe pit and he rent his clothes and he returned unto his brethren and said the child is notand i whither shall i go   and they took josephs coat andkilled a kid of the goats and dipped the coat in the blood  andthey sent the coat of many colours and they brought it to theirfather and said this have we found know now whether it be thy sonscoat or no and he knew it and said it is my sons coat an evil beasthath devoured him joseph is without doubt rent in pieces and jacob rent his clothes and put sackcloth upon his loinsand mourned for his son many days and all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort himbut he refused to be comforted and he said for i will go down intothe grave unto my son mourning thus his father wept for him and the midianites sold him into egypt unto potiphar an officerof pharaohs and captain of the guard and it came to pass at that time that judah went down from hisbrethren and turned in to a certain adullamite whose name was hirah and judah saw there a daughter of a certain canaanite whose namewas shuah and he took her and went in unto her and she conceived and bare a son and he called his name er and she conceived again and bare a son and she called his nameonan and she yet again conceived and bare a son and called his nameshelah and he was at chezib when she bare him and judah took a wife for er his firstborn whose name was tamar and er judahs firstborn was wicked in the sight of the lordand the lord slew him and judah said unto onan go in unto thy brothers wife andmarry her and raise up seed to thy brother and onan knew that the seed should not be his and it came topass when he went in unto his brothers wife that he spilled it onthe ground lest that he should give seed to his brother and the thing which he did displeased the lord wherefore heslew him also then said judah to tamar his daughter in law remain a widow atthy fathers house till shelah my son be grown for he said lestperadventure he die also as his brethren did and tamar went anddwelt in her fathers house and in process of time the daughter of shuah judahs wife diedand judah was comforted and went up unto his sheepshearers totimnath he and his friend hirah the adullamite and it was told tamar saying behold thy father in law goeth upto timnath to shear his sheep and she put her widows garments off from her and covered herwith a vail and wrapped herself and sat in an open place which isby the way to timnath for she saw that shelah was grown and she wasnot given unto him to wife when judah saw her he thought her to be an harlot because shehad covered her face and he turned unto her by the way and said go to i pray theelet me come in unto thee for he knew not that she was his daughterin law and she said what wilt thou give me that thou mayest comein unto me   and he said i will send thee a kid from the flockand she said wilt thou give me a pledge till thou send it  and he said what pledge shall i give thee and she said thy signetand thy bracelets and thy staff that is in thine hand and he gave ither and came in unto her and she conceived by him and she arose and went away and laid by her vail from her andput on the garments of her widowhood and judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the adullamiteto receive his pledge from the womans hand but he found her not then he asked the men of that place saying where is theharlot that was openly by the way side and they said there was noharlot in this place and he returned to judah and said i cannot find her and alsothe men of the place said that there was no harlot in this place and judah said let her take it to her lest we be shamedbehold i sent this kid and thou hast not found her and it came to pass about three months after that it was toldjudah saying tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot andalso behold she is with child by whoredom and judah said bring herforth and let her be burnt when she was brought forth she sent to her father in lawsaying by the man whose these are am i with child and she saiddiscern i pray thee whose are these the signet and bracelets andstaff and judah acknowledged them and said she hath been morerighteous than i because that i gave her not to shelah my son and heknew her again no more and it came to pass in the time of her travail that beholdtwins were in her womb and it came to pass when she travailed that the one put outhis hand and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarletthread saying this came out first and it came to pass as he drew back his hand that behold hisbrother came out and she said how hast thou broken forth thisbreach be upon thee therefore his name was called pharez and afterward came out his brother that had the scarlet threadupon his hand and his name was called zarah and joseph was brought down to egypt and potiphar an officer ofpharaoh captain of the guard an egyptian bought him of the hands ofthe ishmeelites which had brought him down thither and the lord was with joseph and he was a prosperous man and hewas in the house of his master the egyptian and his master saw that the lord was with him and that the lordmade all that he did to prosper in his hand and joseph found grace in his sight and he served him and hemade him overseer over his house and all that he had he put into hishand and it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseerin his house and over all that he had that the lord blessed theegyptians house for josephs sake and the blessing of the lord wasupon all that he had in the house and in the field and he left all that he had in josephs hand and he knew notought he had save the bread which he did eat and joseph was a goodlyperson and well favoured and it came to pass after these things that his masters wifecast her eyes upon joseph and she said lie with me but he refused and said unto his masters wife behold mymaster wotteth not what is with me in the house and he hath committedall that he hath to my hand  there is none greater in this housethan i neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee becausethou art his wife how then can i do this great wickedness and sinagainst god   and it came to pass as she spake to joseph day byday that he hearkened not unto her to lie by her or to be with her and it came to pass about this time that joseph went into thehouse to do his business and there was none of the men of the housethere within and she caught him by his garment saying lie with me and heleft his garment in her hand and fled and got him out and it came to pass when she saw that he had left his garmentin her hand and was fled forth  that she called unto the men ofher house and spake unto them saying see he hath brought in anhebrew unto us to mock us he came in unto me to lie with me and icried with a loud voice  and it came to pass when he heard thati lifted up my voice and cried that he left his garment with me andfled and got him out and she laid up his garment by her until his lord came home and she spake unto him according to these words saying thehebrew servant which thou hast brought unto us came in unto me tomock me  and it came to pass as i lifted up my voice and criedthat he left his garment with me and fled out and it came to pass when his master heard the words of hiswife which she spake unto him saying after this manner did thyservant to me that his wrath was kindled and josephs master took him and put him into the prison aplace where the kings prisoners were bound and he was there in theprison but the lord was with joseph and shewed him mercy and gave himfavour in the sight of the keeper of the prison and the keeper of the prison committed to josephs hand all theprisoners that were in the prison and whatsoever they did there hewas the doer of it the keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was underhis hand because the lord was with him and that which he did thelord made it to prosper and it came to pass after these things that the butler of theking of egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of egypt and pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers against thechief of the butlers and against the chief of the bakers and he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guardinto the prison the place where joseph was bound and the captain of the guard charged joseph with them and heserved them and they continued a season in ward and they dreamed a dream both of them each man his dream in onenight each man according to the interpretation of his dream thebutler and the baker of the king of egypt which were bound in theprison and joseph came in unto them in the morning and looked uponthem and behold they were sad and he asked pharaohs officers that were with him in the ward ofhis lords house saying wherefore look ye so sadly to day   andthey said unto him we have dreamed a dream and there is nointerpreter of it and joseph said unto them do not interpretationsbelong to god tell me them i pray you and the chief butler told his dream to joseph and said to himin my dream behold a vine was before me  and in the vine werethree branches and it was as though it budded and her blossoms shotforth and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes  andpharaohs cup was in my hand and i took the grapes and pressed theminto pharaohs cup and i gave the cup into pharaohs hand and joseph said unto him this is the interpretation of it thethree branches are three days  yet within three days shallpharaoh lift up thine head and restore thee unto thy place and thoushalt deliver pharaohs cup into his hand after the former mannerwhen thou wast his butler but think on me when it shall be well with thee and shewkindness i pray thee unto me and make mention of me unto pharaohand bring me out of this house  for indeed i was stolen away outof the land of the hebrews and here also have i done nothing thatthey should put me into the dungeon when the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good hesaid unto joseph i also was in my dream and behold i had threewhite baskets on my head  and in the uppermost basket there wasof all manner of bakemeats for pharaoh and the birds did eat them outof the basket upon my head and joseph answered and said this is the interpretationthereof the three baskets are three days  yet within three daysshall pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee and shall hang thee on atree and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee and it came to pass the third day which was pharaohs birthdaythat he made a feast unto all his servants and he lifted up the headof the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants and he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again andhe gave the cup into pharaohs hand  but he hanged the chiefbaker as joseph had interpreted to them yet did not the chief butler remember joseph but forgat him and it came to pass at the end of two full years that pharaohdreamed and behold he stood by the river and behold there came up out of the river seven well favouredkine and fatfleshed and they fed in a meadow and behold seven other kine came up after them out of theriver ill favoured and leanfleshed and stood by the other kine uponthe brink of the river and the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the sevenwell favoured and fat kine so pharaoh awoke and he slept and dreamed the second time and behold seven earsof corn came up upon one stalk rank and good and behold seven thin ears and blasted with the east windsprung up after them and the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full earsand pharaoh awoke and behold it was a dream and it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubledand he sent and called for all the magicians of egypt and all thewise men thereof and pharaoh told them his dream but there was nonethat could interpret them unto pharaoh then spake the chief butler unto pharaoh saying i do remembermy faults this day  pharaoh was wroth with his servants and putme in ward in the captain of the guards house both me and the chiefbaker  and we dreamed a dream in one night i and he we dreamedeach man according to the interpretation of his dream and there was there with us a young man an hebrew servant tothe captain of the guard and we told him and he interpreted to usour dreams to each man according to his dream he did interpret and it came to pass as he interpreted to us so it was me herestored unto mine office and him he hanged then pharaoh sent and called joseph and they brought himhastily out of the dungeon and he shaved himself and changed hisraiment and came in unto pharaoh and pharaoh said unto joseph i have dreamed a dream and thereis none that can interpret it and i have heard say of thee that thoucanst understand a dream to interpret it and joseph answered pharaoh saying it is not in me god shallgive pharaoh an answer of peace and pharaoh said unto joseph in my dream behold i stood uponthe bank of the river  and behold there came up out of theriver seven kine fatfleshed and well favoured and they fed in ameadow  and behold seven other kine came up after them poorand very ill favoured and leanfleshed such as i never saw in all theland of egypt for badness  and the lean and the ill favouredkine did eat up the first seven fat kine  and when they hadeaten them up it could not be known that they had eaten them butthey were still ill favoured as at the beginning so i awoke and i saw in my dream and behold seven ears came up in onestalk full and good  and behold seven ears withered thinand blasted with the east wind sprung up after them  and thethin ears devoured the seven good ears and i told this unto themagicians but there was none that could declare it to me and joseph said unto pharaoh the dream of pharaoh is one godhath shewed pharaoh what he is about to do the seven good kine are seven years and the seven good ears areseven years the dream is one and the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after themare seven years and the seven empty ears blasted with the east windshall be seven years of famine this is the thing which i have spoken unto pharaoh what god isabout to do he sheweth unto pharaoh behold there come seven years of great plenty throughout allthe land of egypt  and there shall arise after them seven yearsof famine and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of egyptand the famine shall consume the land  and the plenty shall notbe known in the land by reason of that famine following for it shallbe very grievous and for that the dream was doubled unto pharaoh twice it isbecause the thing is established by god and god will shortly bring itto pass now therefore let pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise andset him over the land of egypt let pharaoh do this and let him appoint officers over the landand take up the fifth part of the land of egypt in the seven plenteousyears and let them gather all the food of those good years that comeand lay up corn under the hand of pharaoh and let them keep food inthe cities and that food shall be for store to the land against the sevenyears of famine which shall be in the land of egypt that the landperish not through the famine and the thing was good in the eyes of pharaoh and in the eyesof all his servants and pharaoh said unto his servants can we find such a one asthis is a man in whom the spirit of god is   and pharaoh saidunto joseph forasmuch as god hath shewed thee all this there is noneso discreet and wise as thou art  thou shalt be over my houseand according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled only in thethrone will i be greater than thou and pharaoh said unto joseph see i have set thee over all theland of egypt and pharaoh took off his ring from his hand and put it uponjosephs hand and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen and put agold chain about his neck  and he made him to ride in the secondchariot which he had and they cried before him bow the knee and hemade him ruler over all the land of egypt and pharaoh said unto joseph i am pharaoh and without theeshall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of egypt and pharaoh called josephs name zaphnathpaaneah and he gavehim to wife asenath the daughter of potipherah priest of on andjoseph went out over all the land of egypt and joseph was thirty years old when he stood before pharaohking of egypt and joseph went out from the presence of pharaoh andwent throughout all the land of egypt and in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth byhandfuls and he gathered up all the food of the seven years which werein the land of egypt and laid up the food in the cities the food ofthe field which was round about every city laid he up in the same and joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea very muchuntil he left numbering for it was without number and unto joseph were born two sons before the years of faminecame which asenath the daughter of potipherah priest of on bare untohim and joseph called the name of the firstborn manasseh for godsaid he hath made me forget all my toil and all my fathers house and the name of the second called he ephraim for god hathcaused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction and the seven years of plenteousness that was in the land ofegypt were ended and the seven years of dearth began to come according as josephhad said and the dearth was in all lands but in all the land ofegypt there was bread and when all the land of egypt was famished the people cried topharaoh for bread and pharaoh said unto all the egyptians go untojoseph what he saith to you do and the famine was over all the face of the earth and josephopened all the storehouses and sold unto the egyptians and thefamine waxed sore in the land of egypt and all countries came into egypt to joseph for to buy cornbecause that the famine was so sore in all lands now when jacob saw that there was corn in egypt jacob said untohis sons why do ye look one upon another   and he said beholdi have heard that there is corn in egypt get you down thither andbuy for us from thence that we may live and not die and josephs ten brethren went down to buy corn in egypt but benjamin josephs brother jacob sent not with his brethrenfor he said lest peradventure mischief befall him and the sons of israel came to buy corn among those that camefor the famine was in the land of canaan and joseph was the governor over the land and he it was thatsold to all the people of the land and josephs brethren came andbowed down themselves before him with their faces to the earth and joseph saw his brethren and he knew them but made himselfstrange unto them and spake roughly unto them and he said unto themwhence come ye and they said from the land of canaan to buy food and joseph knew his brethren but they knew not him and joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them andsaid unto them ye are spies to see the nakedness of the land ye arecome and they said unto him nay my lord but to buy food are thyservants come we are all one mans sons we are true men thy servants are nospies and he said unto them nay but to see the nakedness of the landye are come and they said thy servants are twelve brethren the sons of oneman in the land of canaan and behold the youngest is this day withour father and one is not and joseph said unto them that is it that i spake unto yousaying ye are spies  hereby ye shall be proved by the life ofpharaoh ye shall not go forth hence except your youngest brother comehither send one of you and let him fetch your brother and ye shall bekept in prison that your words may be proved whether there be anytruth in you or else by the life of pharaoh surely ye are spies and he put them all together into ward three days and joseph said unto them the third day this do and live fori fear god  if ye be true men let one of your brethren be boundin the house of your prison go ye carry corn for the famine of yourhouses  but bring your youngest brother unto me so shall yourwords be verified and ye shall not die and they did so and they said one to another we are verily guilty concerningour brother in that we saw the anguish of his soul when he besoughtus and we would not hear therefore is this distress come upon us and reuben answered them saying spake i not unto you sayingdo not sin against the child and ye would not hear thereforebehold also his blood is required and they knew not that joseph understood them for he spake untothem by an interpreter and he turned himself about from them and wept and returned tothem again and communed with them and took from them simeon andbound him before their eyes then joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn and torestore every mans money into his sack and to give them provisionfor the way and thus did he unto them and they laded their asses with the corn and departed thence and as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender inthe inn he espied his money for behold it was in his sacks mouth and he said unto his brethren my money is restored and lo itis even in my sack and their heart failed them and they were afraidsaying one to another what is this that god hath done unto us  and they came unto jacob their father unto the land of canaan andtold him all that befell unto them saying  the man who is thelord of the land spake roughly to us and took us for spies of thecountry and we said unto him we are true men we are no spies  webe twelve brethren sons of our father one is not and the youngestis this day with our father in the land of canaan and the man the lord of the country said unto us hereby shalli know that ye are true men leave one of your brethren here with meand take food for the famine of your households and be gone and bring your youngest brother unto me then shall i know that ye areno spies but that ye are true men so will i deliver you yourbrother and ye shall traffick in the land and it came to pass as they emptied their sacks that beholdevery mans bundle of money was in his sack and when both they andtheir father saw the bundles of money they were afraid and jacob their father said unto them me have ye bereaved of mychildren joseph is not and simeon is not and ye will take benjaminaway all these things are against me and reuben spake unto his father saying slay my two sons if ibring him not to thee deliver him into my hand and i will bring himto thee again and he said my son shall not go down with you for his brotheris dead and he is left alone if mischief befall him by the way inthe which ye go then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow tothe grave and the famine was sore in the land and it came to pass when they had eaten up the corn which theyhad brought out of egypt their father said unto them go again buyus a little food and judah spake unto him saying the man did solemnly protestunto us saying ye shall not see my face except your brother be withyou if thou wilt send our brother with us we will go down and buythee food  but if thou wilt not send him we will not go downfor the man said unto us ye shall not see my face except yourbrother be with you and israel said wherefore dealt ye so ill with me as to tellthe man whether ye had yet a brother   and they said the manasked us straitly of our state and of our kindred saying is yourfather yet alive have ye another brother and we told him accordingto the tenor of these words could we certainly know that he wouldsay bring your brother down   and judah said unto israel hisfather send the lad with me and we will arise and go that we maylive and not die both we and thou and also our little ones i will be surety for him of my hand shalt thou require him if ibring him not unto thee and set him before thee then let me bear theblame for ever  for except we had lingered surely now we hadreturned this second time and their father israel said unto them if it must be so now dothis take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels and carrydown the man a present a little balm and a little honey spices andmyrrh nuts and almonds  and take double money in your handand the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks carryit again in your hand peradventure it was an oversight  takealso your brother and arise go again unto the man  and godalmighty give you mercy before the man that he may send away yourother brother and benjamin if i be bereaved of my children i ambereaved and the men took that present and they took double money intheir hand and benjamin and rose up and went down to egypt andstood before joseph and when joseph saw benjamin with them he said to the ruler ofhis house bring these men home and slay and make ready for thesemen shall dine with me at noon and the man did as joseph bade and the man brought the men intojosephs house and the men were afraid because they were brought into josephshouse and they said because of the money that was returned in oursacks at the first time are we brought in that he may seek occasionagainst us and fall upon us and take us for bondmen and our asses and they came near to the steward of josephs house and theycommuned with him at the door of the house  and said o sir wecame indeed down at the first time to buy food  and it came topass when we came to the inn that we opened our sacks and beholdevery mans money was in the mouth of his sack our money in fullweight and we have brought it again in our hand and other money have we brought down in our hands to buy foodwe cannot tell who put our money in our sacks and he said peace be to you fear not your god and the god ofyour father hath given you treasure in your sacks i had your moneyand he brought simeon out unto them and the man brought the men into josephs house and gave themwater and they washed their feet and he gave their asses provender and they made ready the present against joseph came at noon forthey heard that they should eat bread there and when joseph came home they brought him the present whichwas in their hand into the house and bowed themselves to him to theearth and he asked them of their welfare and said is your fatherwell the old man of whom ye spake is he yet alive   and theyanswered thy servant our father is in good health he is yet aliveand they bowed down their heads and made obeisance and he lifted up his eyes and saw his brother benjamin hismothers son and said is this your younger brother of whom ye spakeunto me and he said god be gracious unto thee my son and joseph made haste for his bowels did yearn upon hisbrother and he sought where to weep and he entered into his chamberand wept there and he washed his face and went out and refrained himself andsaid set on bread and they set on for him by himself and for them by themselvesand for the egyptians which did eat with him by themselves becausethe egyptians might not eat bread with the hebrews for that is anabomination unto the egyptians and they sat before him the firstborn according to hisbirthright and the youngest according to his youth and the menmarvelled one at another and he took and sent messes unto them from before him butbenjamins mess was five times so much as any of theirs and theydrank and were merry with him and he commanded the steward of his house saying fill the menssacks with food as much as they can carry and put every mans moneyin his sacks mouth and put my cup the silver cup in the sacks mouth of theyoungest and his corn money and he did according to the word thatjoseph had spoken as soon as the morning was light the men were sent away theyand their asses and when they were gone out of the city and not yet far offjoseph said unto his steward up follow after the men and when thoudost overtake them say unto them wherefore have ye rewarded evil forgood   is not this it in which my lord drinketh and wherebyindeed he divineth ye have done evil in so doing and he overtook them and he spake unto them these same words and they said unto him wherefore saith my lord these words godforbid that thy servants should do according to this thing behold the money which we found in our sacks mouths we broughtagain unto thee out of the land of canaan how then should we stealout of thy lords house silver or gold   with whomsoever of thyservants it be found both let him die and we also will be my lordsbondmen and he said now also let it be according unto your words hewith whom it is found shall be my servant and ye shall be blameless then they speedily took down every man his sack to the groundand opened every man his sack and he searched and began at the eldest and left at theyoungest and the cup was found in benjamins sack then they rent their clothes and laded every man his ass andreturned to the city and judah and his brethren came to josephs house for he wasyet there and they fell before him on the ground and joseph said unto them what deed is this that ye have donewot ye not that such a man as i can certainly divine   and judahsaid what shall we say unto my lord what shall we speak  or howshall we clear ourselves god hath found out the iniquity of thyservants behold we are my lords servants both we and he also withwhom the cup is found and he said god forbid that i should do so but the man inwhose hand the cup is found he shall be my servant and as for youget you up in peace unto your father then judah came near unto him and said oh my lord let thyservant i pray thee speak a word in my lords ears and let notthine anger burn against thy servant for thou art even as pharaoh my lord asked his servants saying have ye a father or abrother   and we said unto my lord we have a father an oldman and a child of his old age a little one and his brother isdead and he alone is left of his mother and his father loveth him and thou saidst unto thy servants bring him down unto me thati may set mine eyes upon him and we said unto my lord the lad cannot leave his father forif he should leave his father his father would die and thou saidst unto thy servants except your youngest brothercome down with you ye shall see my face no more and it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my fatherwe told him the words of my lord and our father said go again and buy us a little food and we said we cannot go down if our youngest brother be withus then will we go down for we may not see the mans face exceptour youngest brother be with us and thy servant my father said unto us ye know that my wifebare me two sons  and the one went out from me and i saidsurely he is torn in pieces and i saw him not since  and if yetake this also from me and mischief befall him ye shall bring downmy gray hairs with sorrow to the grave now therefore when i come to thy servant my father and the ladbe not with us seeing that his life is bound up in the lads life it shall come to pass when he seeth that the lad is not withus that he will die and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairsof thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave for thy servant became surety for the lad unto my fathersaying if i bring him not unto thee then i shall bear the blame tomy father for ever now therefore i pray thee let thy servant abide instead of thelad a bondman to my lord and let the lad go up with his brethren for how shall i go up to my father and the lad be not with melest peradventure i see the evil that shall come on my father then joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stoodby him and he cried cause every man to go out from me and therestood no man with him while joseph made himself known unto hisbrethren and he wept aloud and the egyptians and the house of pharaohheard and joseph said unto his brethren i am joseph doth my fatheryet live and his brethren could not answer him for they weretroubled at his presence and joseph said unto his brethren come near to me i pray youand they came near and he said i am joseph your brother whom yesold into egypt now therefore be not grieved nor angry with yourselves that yesold me hither for god did send me before you to preserve life for these two years hath the famine been in the land and yetthere are five years in the which there shall neither be earing norharvest and god sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in theearth and to save your lives by a great deliverance so now it was not you that sent me hither but god and he hathmade me a father to pharaoh and lord of all his house and a rulerthroughout all the land of egypt haste ye and go up to my father and say unto him thus saiththy son joseph god hath made me lord of all egypt come down unto metarry not  and thou shalt dwell in the land of goshen and thoushalt be near unto me thou and thy children and thy childrenschildren and thy flocks and thy herds and all that thou hast and there will i nourish thee for yet there are five years of faminelest thou and thy household and all that thou hast come to poverty and behold your eyes see and the eyes of my brother benjaminthat it is my mouth that speaketh unto you and ye shall tell my father of all my glory in egypt and of allthat ye have seen and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither and he fell upon his brother benjamins neck and wept andbenjamin wept upon his neck moreover he kissed all his brethren and wept upon them andafter that his brethren talked with him and the fame thereof was heard in pharaohs house sayingjosephs brethren are come and it pleased pharaoh well and hisservants and pharaoh said unto joseph say unto thy brethren this do yelade your beasts and go get you unto the land of canaan  andtake your father and your households and come unto me and i willgive you the good of the land of egypt and ye shall eat the fat ofthe land now thou art commanded this do ye take you wagons out of theland of egypt for your little ones and for your wives and bring yourfather and come also regard not your stuff for the good of all the land ofegypt is yours and the children of israel did so and joseph gave them wagonsaccording to the commandment of pharaoh and gave them provision forthe way to all of them he gave each man changes of raiment but tobenjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five changes ofraiment and to his father he sent after this manner ten asses ladenwith the good things of egypt and ten she asses laden with corn andbread and meat for his father by the way so he sent his brethren away and they departed and he saidunto them see that ye fall not out by the way and they went up out of egypt and came into the land of canaanunto jacob their father  and told him saying joseph is yetalive and he is governor over all the land of egypt and jacobsheart fainted for he believed them not and they told him all the words of joseph which he had saidunto them and when he saw the wagons which joseph had sent to carryhim the spirit of jacob their father revived  and israel saidit is enough joseph my son is yet alive i will go and see him beforei die and israel took his journey with all that he had and came tobeersheba and offered sacrifices unto the god of his father isaac and god spake unto israel in the visions of the night and saidjacob jacob and he said here am i and he said i am god the god of thy father fear not to go downinto egypt for i will there make of thee a great nation  i willgo down with thee into egypt and i will also surely bring thee upagain and joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes and jacob rose up from beersheba and the sons of israel carriedjacob their father and their little

may dwell in the land ofgoshen for every shepherd is an abomination unto the egyptians then joseph came and told pharaoh and said my father and mybrethren and their flocks and their herds and all that they haveare come out of the land of canaan and behold they are in the landof goshen and he took some of his brethren even five men and presentedthem unto pharaoh and pharaoh said unto his brethren what is your occupation andthey said unto pharaoh thy servants are shepherds both we and alsoour fathers they said morever unto pharaoh for to sojourn in the land are wecome for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks for thefamine is sore in the land of canaan now therefore we pray thee letthy servants dwell in the land of goshen and pharaoh spake unto joseph saying thy father and thybrethren are come unto thee  the land of egypt is before thee inthe best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell in theland of goshen let them dwell and if thou knowest any men of activityamong them then make them rulers over my cattle and joseph brought in jacob his father and set him beforepharaoh and jacob blessed pharaoh and pharaoh said unto jacob how old art thou   and jacobsaid unto pharaoh the days of the years of my pilgrimage are anhundred and thirty years few and evil have the days of the years ofmy life been and have not attained unto the days of the years of thelife of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage and jacob blessed pharaoh and went out from before pharaoh and joseph placed his father and his brethren and gave them apossession in the land of egypt in the best of the land in the landof rameses as pharaoh had commanded and joseph nourished his father and his brethren and all hisfathers household with bread according to their families and there was no bread in all the land for the famine was verysore so that the land of egypt and all the land of canaan fainted byreason of the famine and joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the landof egypt and in the land of canaan for the corn which they boughtand joseph brought the money into pharaohs house and when money failed in the land of egypt and in the land ofcanaan all the egyptians came unto joseph and said give us breadfor why should we die in thy presence for the money faileth and joseph said give your cattle and i will give you for yourcattle if money fail and they brought their cattle unto joseph and joseph gave thembread in exchange for horses and for the flocks and for the cattleof the herds and for the asses and he fed them with bread for alltheir cattle for that year when that year was ended they came unto him the second yearand said unto him we will not hide it from my lord how that ourmoney is spent my lord also hath our herds of cattle there is notought left in the sight of my lord but our bodies and our lands wherefore shall we die before thine eyes both we and our landbuy us and our land for bread and we and our land will be servantsunto pharaoh and give us seed that we may live and not die thatthe land be not desolate and joseph bought all the land of egypt for pharaoh for theegyptians sold every man his field because the famine prevailed overthem so the land became pharaohs and as for the people he removed them to cities from one end ofthe borders of egypt even to the other end thereof only the land of the priests bought he not for the priests hada portion assigned them of pharaoh and did eat their portion whichpharaoh gave them wherefore they sold not their lands then joseph said unto the people behold i have bought you thisday and your land for pharaoh lo here is seed for you and ye shallsow the land and it shall come to pass in the increase that ye shall givethe fifth part unto pharaoh and four parts shall be your own forseed of the field and for your food and for them of your householdsand for food for your little ones and they said thou hast saved our lives let us find grace inthe sight of my lord and we will be pharaohs servants and joseph made it a law over the land of egypt unto this daythat pharaoh should have the fifth part except the land of thepriests only which became not pharaohs and israel dwelt in the land of egypt in the country of goshenand they had possessions therein and grew and multipliedexceedingly and jacob lived in the land of egypt seventeen years so thewhole age of jacob was an hundred forty and seven years and the time drew nigh that israel must die and he called hisson joseph and said unto him if now i have found grace in thy sightput i pray thee thy hand under my thigh and deal kindly and trulywith me bury me not i pray thee in egypt  but i will lie withmy fathers and thou shalt carry me out of egypt and bury me in theirburyingplace and he said i will do as thou hast said and he said swear unto me and he sware unto him and israelbowed himself upon the beds head and it came to pass after these things that one told josephbehold thy father is sick and he took with him his two sonsmanasseh and ephraim and one told jacob and said behold thy son joseph cometh untothee and israel strengthened himself and sat upon the bed and jacob said unto joseph god almighty appeared unto me at luzin the land of canaan and blessed me  and said unto me beholdi will make thee fruitful and multiply thee and i will make of theea multitude of people and will give this land to thy seed after theefor an everlasting possession and now thy two sons ephraim and manasseh which were born untothee in the land of egypt before i came unto thee into egypt aremine as reuben and simeon they shall be mine and thy issue which thou begettest after them shall be thineand shall be called after the name of their brethren in theirinheritance and as for me when i came from padan rachel died by me in theland of canaan in the way when yet there was but a little way to comeunto ephrath and i buried her there in the way of ephrath the sameis bethlehem and israel beheld josephs sons and said who are these  and joseph said unto his father they are my sons whom god hath givenme in this place and he said bring them i pray thee unto me and iwill bless them now the eyes of israel were dim for age so that he could notseeand he brought them near unto him and he kissed them and embracedthem and israel said unto joseph i had not thought to see thy faceand lo god hath shewed me also thy seed and joseph brought them out from between his knees and he bowedhimself with his face to the earth and joseph took them both ephraim in his right hand towardisraels left hand and manasseh in his left hand toward israelsright hand and brought them near unto him and israel stretched out his right hand and laid it uponephraims head who was the younger and his left hand upon manassehshead guiding his hands wittingly for manasseh was the firstborn and he blessed joseph and said god before whom my fathersabraham and isaac did walk the god which fed me all my life long untothis day  the angel which redeemed me from all evil bless thelads and let my name be named on them and the name of my fathersabraham and isaac and let them grow into a multitude in the midst ofthe earth and when joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon thehead of ephraim it displeased him and he held up his fathers handto remove it from ephraims head unto manassehs head and joseph said unto his father not so my father for this isthe firstborn put thy right hand upon his head and his father refused and said i know it my son i know ithe also shall become a people and he also shall be great but trulyhis younger brother shall be greater than he and his seed shallbecome a multitude of nations and he blessed them that day saying in thee shall israelbless saying god make thee as ephraim and as manasseh and he setephraim before manasseh and israel said unto joseph behold i die but god shall bewith you and bring you again unto the land of your fathers moreover i have given to thee one portion above thy brethrenwhich i took out of the hand of the amorite with my sword and with mybow and jacob called unto his sons and said gather yourselvestogether that i may tell you that which shall befall you in the lastdays gather yourselves together and hear ye sons of jacob andhearken unto israel your father reuben thou art my firstborn my might and the beginning of mystrength the excellency of dignity and the excellency of power unstable as water thou shalt not excel because thou wentest up tothy fathers bed then defiledst thou it he went up to my couch simeon and levi are brethren instruments of cruelty are in theirhabitations o my soul come not thou into their secret unto their assemblymine honour be not thou united for in their anger they slew a manand in their selfwill they digged down a wall cursed be their anger for it was fierce and their wrath for itwas cruel i will divide them in jacob and scatter them in israel judah thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise thy hand shallbe in

him and shot at him and hated him  but his bow abodein strength and the arms of his hands were made strong by the handsof the mighty god of jacob from thence is the shepherd the stone ofisrael  even by the god of thy father who shall help thee andby the almighty who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven aboveblessings of the deep that lieth under blessings of the breasts andof the womb  the blessings of thy father have prevailed abovethe blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of theeverlasting hills they shall be on the head of joseph and on thecrown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren benjamin shall ravin as a wolf in the morning he shall devourthe prey and at night he shall divide the spoil all these are the twelve tribes of israel and this is it thattheir father spake unto them and blessed them every one according tohis blessing he blessed them and he charged them and said unto them i am to be gatheredunto my people bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in thefield of ephron the hittite  in the cave that is in the field ofmachpelah which is before mamre in the land of canaan which abrahambought with the field of ephron the hittite for a possession of aburyingplace there they buried abraham and sarah his wife there they buriedisaac and rebekah his wife and there i buried leah the purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein wasfrom the children of heth and when jacob had made an end of commanding his sons hegathered up his feet into the bed and yielded up the ghost and wasgathered unto his people and joseph fell upon his fathers face and wept upon him andkissed him and joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm hisfather and the physicians embalmed israel and forty days were fulfilled for him for so are fulfilled thedays of those which are embalmed and the egyptians mourned for himthreescore and ten days and when the days of his mourning were past joseph spake untothe house of pharaoh saying if now i have found grace in your eyesspeak i pray you in the ears of pharaoh saying  my father mademe swear saying lo i die in my grave which i have digged for me inthe land of canaan there shalt thou bury me now therefore let me goup i pray thee and bury my father and i will come again and pharaoh said go up and bury thy father according as hemade thee swear and joseph went up to bury his father and with him went up allthe servants of pharaoh the elders of his house and all the eldersof the land of egypt  and all the house of joseph and hisbrethren and his fathers house only their little ones and theirflocks and their herds they left in the land of goshen and there went up with him both chariots and horsemen and it wasa very great company and they came to the threshingfloor of atad which is beyondjordan and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentationand he made a mourning for his father seven days and when the inhabitants of the land the canaanites saw themourning in the floor of atad they said this is a grievous mourningto the egyptians wherefore the name of it was called abelmizraimwhich is beyond jordan and his sons did unto him according as he commanded them for his sons carried him into the land of canaan and buried him inthe cave of the field of machpelah which abraham bought with thefield for a possession of a buryingplace of ephron the hittite beforemamre and joseph returned into egypt he and his brethren and allthat went up with him to bury his father after he had buried hisfather and when josephs brethren saw that their father was dead theysaid joseph will peradventure hate us and will certainly requite usall the evil which we did unto him and they sent a messenger unto joseph saying thy father didcommand before he died saying  so shall ye say unto josephforgive i pray thee now the trespass of thy brethren and their sinfor they did unto thee evil and now we pray thee forgive thetrespass of the servants of the god of thy father and joseph weptwhen they spake unto him and his brethren also went and fell down before his face andthey said behold we be thy servants and joseph said unto them fear not for am i in the place ofgod   but as for you ye thought evil against me but god meantit unto good to bring to pass as it is this day to save much peoplealive now therefore fear ye not i will nourish you and your littleonesand he comforted them and spake kindly unto them and joseph dwelt in egypt he and his fathers house andjoseph lived an hundred and ten years and joseph saw ephraims children of the third generation thechildren also of machir the son of manasseh were brought up uponjosephs knees and joseph said unto his brethren i die and god will surelyvisit you and bring you out of this land unto the land which he swareto abraham to isaac and to jacob and joseph took an oath of the children of israel saying godwill surely visit you and ye shall carry up my bones from hence so joseph died being an hundred and ten years old and theyembalmed him and he was put in a coffin in egyptthe second book of moses  called exodus now these are the names of the children of israel which cameinto egypt every man and his household came with jacob reuben simeon levi and judah  issachar zebulun andbenjamin  dan and naphtali gad and asher and all the souls that came out of the loins of jacob were seventysouls for joseph was in egypt already and joseph died and all his brethren and all that generation and the children of israel were fruitful and increasedabundantly and multiplied and waxed exceeding mighty and the landwas filled with them now there arose up a new king over egypt which knew not joseph and he said unto his people behold the people of the children ofisrael are more and mightier than we  come on let us deal wiselywith them lest they multiply and it come to pass that when therefalleth out any war they join also unto our enemies and fightagainst us and so get them up out of the land therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them withtheir burdens and they built for pharaoh treasure cities pithom andraamses but the more they afflicted them the more they multiplied andgrewand they were grieved because of the children of israel and the egyptians made the children of israel to serve withrigour  and they made their lives bitter with hard bondage inmorter and in brick and in all manner of service in the field alltheir service wherein they made them serve was with rigour and the king of egypt spake to the hebrew midwives of which thename of the one was shiphrah and the name of the other puah  andhe said when ye do the office of a midwife to the hebrew women andsee them upon the stools if it be a son then ye shall kill him butif it be a daughter then she shall live but the midwives feared god and did not as the king of egyptcommanded them but saved the men children alive and the king of egypt called for the midwives and said untothem why have ye done this thing and have saved the men childrenalive   and the midwives said unto pharaoh because the hebrewwomen are not as the egyptian women for they are lively and aredelivered ere the midwives come in unto them therefore god dealt well with the midwives and the peoplemultiplied and waxed very mighty and it came to pass because the midwives feared god that hemade them houses and pharaoh charged all his people saying every son that isborn ye shall cast into the river and every daughter ye shall savealive and there went a man of the house of levi and took to wife adaughter of levi and the woman conceived and bare a son and when she saw him thathe was a goodly child she hid him three months and when she could not longer hide him she took for him an ark ofbulrushes and daubed it with slime and with pitch and put the childtherein and she laid it in the flags by the rivers brink and his sister stood afar off to wit what would be done to him and the daughter of pharaoh came down to wash herself at theriver and her maidens walked along by the rivers side and when shesaw the ark among the flags she sent her maid to fetch it and when she had opened it she saw the child and behold thebabe wept and she had compassion on him and said this is one of thehebrews children then said his sister to pharaohs daughter shall i go and call tothee a nurse of the hebrew women that she may nurse the child forthee   and pharaohs daughter said to her go and the maid wentand called the childs mother and pharaohs daughter said unto her take this child away andnurse it for me and i will give thee thy wages and the women tookthe child and nursed it and the child grew and she brought him unto pharaohs daughterand he became her son and she called his name moses and she saidbecause i drew him out of the water and it came to pass in those days when moses was grown that hewent out unto his brethren and looked on their burdens and he spiedan egyptian smiting an hebrew one of his brethren and he looked this way and that way and when he saw that therewas no man he slew the egyptian and hid him in the sand and when he went out the second day behold two men of thehebrews strove together and he said to him that did the wrongwherefore smitest thou thy fellow   and he said who made thee aprince and a judge over us intendest thou to kill me as thoukilledst the egyptian and moses feared and said surely this thingis known now when pharaoh heard this thing he sought to slay moses butmoses fled from the face of pharaoh and dwelt in the land of midianand he sat down by a well now the priest of midian had seven daughters and they came anddrew water and filled the troughs to water their fathers flock and the shepherds came and drove them away but moses stood upand helped them and watered their flock and when they came to reuel their father he said how is it thatye are come so soon to day   and they said an egyptian deliveredus out of the hand of the shepherds and also drew water enough forus and watered the flock and he said unto his daughters and where is he why is it thatye have left the man call him that he may eat bread and moses was content to dwell with the man and he gave moseszipporah his daughter and she bare him a son and he called his name gershom for hesaid i have been a stranger in a strange land and it came to pass in process of time that the king of egyptdied and the children of israel sighed by reason of the bondage andthey cried and their cry came up unto god by reason of the bondage and god heard their groaning and god remembered his covenantwith abraham with isaac and with jacob and god looked upon the children of israel and god had respectunto them now moses kept the flock of jethro his father in law the priestof midian and he led the flock to the backside of the desert andcame to the mountain of god even to horeb and the angel of the lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire outof the midst of a bush and he looked and behold the bush burnedwith fire and the bush was not consumed and moses said i will now turn aside and see this great sightwhy the bush is not burnt and when the lord saw that he turned aside to see god called untohim out of the midst of the bush and said moses moses and he saidhere am i and he said draw not nigh hither put off thy shoes from off thyfeet for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground moreover he said i am the god of thy father the god of abrahamthe god of isaac and the god of jacob and moses hid his face for hewas afraid to look upon god and the lord said i have surely seen the affliction of my peoplewhich are in egypt and have heard their cry by reason of theirtaskmasters for i know their sorrows  and i am come down todeliver them out of the hand of the egyptians and to bring them upout of that land unto a good land and a large unto a land flowingwith milk and honey unto the place of the canaanites and thehittites and the amorites and the perizzites and the hivites andthe jebusites now therefore behold the cry of the children of israel is comeunto me and i have also seen the oppression wherewith the egyptiansoppress them come now therefore and i will send thee unto pharaoh that thoumayest bring forth my people the children of israel out of egypt and moses said unto god who am i that i should go unto pharaohand that i should bring forth the children of israel out of egypt and he said certainly i will be with thee and this shall be atoken unto thee that i have sent thee when thou hast brought forththe people out of egypt ye shall serve god upon this mountain and moses said unto god behold when i come unto the children ofisrael and shall say unto them the god of your fathers hath sent meunto you and they shall say to me what is his name what shall i sayunto them   and god said unto moses i am that i am and he saidthus shalt thou say unto the children of israel i am hath sent meunto you and god said moreover unto moses thus shalt thou say unto thechildren of israel the lord god of your fathers the god of abrahamthe god of isaac and the god of jacob hath sent me unto you this ismy name for ever and this is my memorial unto all generations go and gather the elders of israel together and say unto themthe lord god of your fathers the god of abraham of isaac and ofjacob appeared unto me saying i have surely visited you and seenthat which is done to you in egypt  and i have said i will bringyou up out of the affliction of egypt unto the land of the canaanitesand the hittites and the amorites and the perizzites and thehivites and the jebusites unto a land flowing with milk and honey and they shall hearken to thy voice and thou shalt come thouand the elders of israel unto the king of egypt and ye shall sayunto him the lord god of the hebrews hath met with us and now let usgo we beseech thee three days journey into the wilderness that wemay sacrifice to the lord our god and i am sure that the king of egypt will not let you go no notby a mighty hand and i will stretch out my hand and smite egypt with all mywonders which i will do in the midst thereof and after that he willlet you go and i will give this people favour in the sight of the egyptiansand it shall come to pass that when ye go ye shall not go empty but every woman shall borrow of her neighbour and of her thatsojourneth in her house jewels of silver and jewels of gold andraiment and ye shall put them upon your sons and upon yourdaughters and ye shall spoil the egyptians and moses answered and said but behold they will not believeme nor hearken unto my voice for they will say the lord hath notappeared unto thee and the lord said unto him what is that in thine hand and hesaid a rod and he said cast it on the ground and he cast it on the groundand it became a serpent and moses fled from before it and the lord said unto moses put forth thine hand and take it bythe tail and he put forth his hand and caught it and it became arod in his hand  that they may believe that the lord god of theirfathers the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacobhath appeared unto thee and the lord said furthermore unto him put now thine hand intothy bosom and he put his hand into his bosom and when he took itout behold his hand was leprous as snow and he said put thine hand into thy bosom again and he put hishand into his bosom again and plucked it out of his bosom andbehold it was turned again as his other flesh and it shall come to pass if they will not believe thee neitherhearken to the voice of the first sign that they will believe thevoice of the latter sign and it shall come to pass if they will not believe also these twosigns neither hearken unto thy voice that thou shalt take of thewater of the river and pour it upon the dry land and the water whichthou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land and moses said unto the lord o my lord i am not eloquentneither heretofore nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant but iam slow of speech and of a slow tongue and the lord said unto him who hath made mans mouth or whomaketh the dumb or deaf or the seeing or the blind have not i thelord   now therefore go and i will be with thy mouth and teachthee what thou shalt say and he said o my lord send i pray thee by the hand of himwhom thou wilt send and the anger of the lord was kindled against moses and he saidis not aaron the levite thy brother i know that he can speak welland also behold he cometh forth to meet thee and when he seeththee he will be glad in his heart and thou shalt speak unto him and put words in his mouth and iwill be with thy mouth and with his mouth and will teach you what yeshall do and he shall be thy spokesman unto the people and he shall beeven he shall be to thee instead of a mouth and thou shalt be to himinstead of god and thou shalt take this rod in thine hand wherewith thou shaltdo signs and moses went and returned to jethro his father in law and saidunto him let me go i pray thee and return unto my brethren whichare in egypt and see whether they be yet alive and jethro said tomoses go in peace and the lord said unto moses in midian go return into egyptfor all the men are dead which sought thy life and moses took his wife and his sons and set them upon an assand he returned to the land of egypt and moses took the rod of god inhis hand and the lord said unto moses when thou goest to return intoegypt see that thou do all those wonders before pharaoh which i haveput in thine hand but i will harden his heart that he shall not letthe people go and thou shalt say unto pharaoh thus saith the lord israel ismy son even my firstborn  and i say unto thee let my son gothat he may serve me and if thou refuse to let him go behold i willslay thy son even thy firstborn and it came to pass by the way in the inn that the lord met himand sought to kill him then zipporah took a sharp stone and cut off the foreskin of herson and cast it at his feet and said surely a bloody husband artthou to me so he let him go then she said a bloody husband thou artbecause of the circumcision and the lord said to aaron go into the wilderness to meet mosesand he went and met him in the mount of god and kissed him and moses told aaron all the words of the lord who had sent himand all the signs which he had commanded him and moses and aaron went and gathered together all the elders ofthe children of israel  and aaron spake all the words which thelord had spoken unto moses and did the signs in the sight of thepeople and the people believed and when they heard that the lord hadvisited the children of israel and that he had looked upon theiraffliction then they bowed their heads and worshipped and afterward moses and aaron went in and told pharaoh thussaith the lord god of israel let my people go that they may hold afeast unto me in the wilderness and pharaoh said who is the lord that i should obey his voice tolet israel go i know not the lord neither will i let israel go and they said the god of the hebrews hath met with us let us gowe pray thee three days journey into the desert and sacrifice untothe lord our god lest he fall upon us with pestilence or with thesword and the king of egypt said unto them wherefore do ye moses andaaron let the people from their works get you unto your burdens and pharaoh said behold the people of the land now are many andye make them rest from their burdens and pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the peopleand their officers saying  ye shall no more give the people strawto make brick as heretofore let them go and gather straw forthemselves and the tale of the bricks which they did make heretofore yeshall lay upon them ye shall not diminish ought thereof for they beidle therefore they cry saying let us go and sacrifice to our god let there more work be laid upon the men that they may labourtherein and let them not regard vain words and the taskmasters of the people went out and their officersand they spake to the people saying thus saith pharaoh i will notgive you straw go ye get you straw where ye can find it yet not ought of yourwork shall be diminished so the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land ofegypt to gather stubble instead of straw and the taskmasters hasted them saying fulfil your works yourdaily tasks as when there was straw and the officers of the children of israel which pharaohstaskmasters had set over them were beaten and demanded whereforehave ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and today as heretofore   then the officers of the children of israelcame and cried unto pharaoh saying wherefore dealest thou thus withthy servants   there is no straw given unto thy servants andthey say to us make brick and behold thy servants are beaten butthe fault is in thine own people but he said ye are idle ye are idle therefore ye say let usgo and do sacrifice to the lord go therefore now and work for there shall no straw be givenyou yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks and the officers of the children of israel did see that they werein evil case after it was said ye shall not minish ought from yourbricks of your daily task and they met moses and aaron who stood in the way as they cameforth from pharaoh  and they said unto them the lord look uponyou and judge because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in theeyes of pharaoh and in the eyes of his servants to put a sword intheir hand to slay us and moses returned unto the lord and said lord wherefore hastthou so evil entreated this people why is it that thou hast sent me for since i came to pharaoh to speak in thy name he hath doneevil to this people neither hast thou delivered thy people at all then the lord said unto moses now shalt thou see what i will doto pharaoh for with a strong hand shall he let them go and with astrong hand shall he drive them out of his land and god spake unto moses and said unto him i am the lord and i appeared unto abraham unto isaac and unto jacob by the nameof god almighty but by my name jehovah was i not known to them and i have also established my covenant with them to give themthe land of canaan the land of their pilgrimage wherein they werestrangers and i have also heard the groaning of the children of israel whomthe egyptians keep in bondage and i have remembered my covenant wherefore say unto the children of israel i am the lord and iwill bring you out from under the burdens of the egyptians and i willrid you out of their bondage and i will redeem you with a stretchedout arm and with great judgments  and i will take you to me for apeople and i will be to you a god and ye shall know that i am thelord your god which bringeth you out from under the burdens of theegyptians and i will bring you in unto the land concerning the which i didswear to give it to abraham to isaac and to jacob and i will giveit you for an heritage i am the lord and moses spake so unto the children of israel but they hearkenednot unto moses for anguish of spirit and for cruel bondage and the lord spake unto moses saying  go in speak untopharaoh king of egypt that he let the children of israel go out ofhis land and moses spake before the lord saying behold the children ofisrael have not hearkened unto me how then shall pharaoh hear me whoam of uncircumcised lips   and the lord spake unto moses and

these are that aaron and moses to whom the lord said bring outthe children of israel from the land of egypt according to theirarmies these are they which spake to pharaoh king of egypt to bring outthe children of israel from egypt these are that moses and aaron and it came to pass on the day when the lord spake unto moses inthe land of egypt  that the lord spake unto moses saying i amthe lord speak thou unto pharaoh king of egypt all that i say untothee and moses said before the lord behold i am of uncircumcisedlips and how shall pharaoh hearken unto me   and the lord saidunto moses see i have made thee a god to pharaoh and aaron thybrother shall be thy prophet thou shalt speak all that i command thee and aaron thy brothershall speak unto pharaoh that he send the children of israel out ofhis land and i will harden pharaohs heart and multiply my signs and mywonders in the land of egypt but pharaoh shall not hearken unto you that i may lay my handupon egypt and bring forth mine armies and my people the children ofisrael out of the land of egypt by great judgments and the egyptians shall know that i am the lord when i stretchforth mine hand upon egypt and bring out the children of israel fromamong them and moses and aaron did as the lord commanded them so did they and moses was fourscore years old and aaron fourscore and threeyears old when they spake unto pharaoh and the lord spake unto moses and unto aaron saying  whenpharaoh shall speak unto you saying shew a miracle for you thenthou shalt say unto aaron take thy rod and cast it before pharaohand it shall become a serpent and moses and aaron went in unto pharaoh and they did so as thelord had commanded and aaron cast down his rod before pharaoh andbefore his servants and it became a serpent then pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers now themagicians of egypt they also did in like manner with theirenchantments for they cast down every man his rod and they became serpentsbut aarons rod swallowed up their rods and he hardened pharaohs heart that he hearkened not unto themas the lord had said and the lord said unto moses pharaohs heart is hardened herefuseth to let the people go get thee unto pharaoh in the morning lo he goeth out unto thewater and thou shalt stand by the rivers brink against he come andthe rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand and thou shalt say unto him the lord god of the hebrews hathsent me unto thee saying let my people go that they may serve me inthe wilderness and behold hitherto thou wouldest not hear thus saith the lord in this thou shalt know that i am the lordbehold i will smite with the rod that is in mine hand upon the waterswhich are in the river and they shall be turned to blood and the fish that is in the river shall die and the river shallstink and the egyptians shall lothe to drink of the water of theriver and the lord spake unto moses say unto aaron take thy rod andstretch out thine hand upon the waters of egypt upon their streamsupon their rivers and upon their ponds and upon all their pools ofwater that they may become blood and that there may be bloodthroughout all the land of egypt both in vessels of wood and invessels of stone and moses and aaron did so as the lord commanded and he liftedup the rod and smote the waters that were in the river in the sightof pharaoh and in the sight of his servants and all the waters thatwere in the river were turned to blood and the fish that was in the river died and the river stank andthe egyptians could not drink of the water of the river and there wasblood throughout all the land of egypt and the magicians of egypt did so with their enchantments andpharaohs heart was hardened neither did he hearken unto them as thelord had said and pharaoh turned and went into his house neither did he sethis heart to this also and all the egyptians digged round about the river for water todrink for they could not drink of the water of the river and seven days were fulfilled after that the lord had smittenthe river and the lord spake unto moses go unto pharaoh and say unto himthus saith the lord let my people go that they may serve me and if thou refuse to let them go behold i will smite all thyborders with frogs  and the river shall bring forth frogsabundantly which shall go up and come into thine house and into thybedchamber and upon thy bed and into the house of thy servants andupon thy people and into thine ovens and into thy kneadingtroughs and the frogs shall come up both on thee and upon thy people andupon all thy servants and the lord spake unto moses say unto aaron stretch forth thinehand with thy rod over the streams over the rivers and over theponds and cause frogs to come up upon the land of egypt and aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of egypt and thefrogs came up and covered the land of egypt and the magicians did so with their enchantments and brought upfrogs upon the land of egypt then pharaoh called for moses and aaron and said intreat thelord that he may take away the frogs from me and from my people andi will let the people go that they may do sacrifice unto the lord and moses said unto pharaoh glory over me when shall i intreatfor thee and for thy servants and for thy people to destroy thefrogs from thee and thy houses that they may remain in the riveronly   and he said to morrow and he said be it according tothy word that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the lordour god and the frogs shall depart from thee and from thy houses andfrom thy servants and from thy people they shall remain in the riveronly and moses and aaron went out from pharaoh and moses cried untothe lord because of the frogs which he had brought against pharaoh and the lord did according to the word of moses and the frogsdied out of the houses out of the villages and out of the fields and they gathered them together upon heaps and the land stank but when pharaoh saw that there was respite he hardened hisheart and hearkened not unto them as the lord had said and the lord said unto moses say unto aaron stretch out thyrod and smite the dust of the land that it may become licethroughout all the land of egypt and they did so for aaron stretched out his hand with his rodand smote the dust of the earth and it became lice in man and inbeast all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land ofegypt and the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forthlice but they could not so there were lice upon man and upon beast then the magicians said unto pharaoh this is the finger of godand pharaohs heart was hardened and he hearkened not unto them asthe lord had said and the lord said unto moses rise up early in the morning andstand before pharaoh lo he cometh forth to the water and say untohim thus saith the lord let my people go that they may serve me else if thou wilt not let my people go behold i will sendswarms of flies upon thee and upon thy servants and upon thy peopleand into thy houses and the houses of the egyptians shall be full ofswarms of flies and also the ground whereon they are and i will sever in that day the land of goshen in which mypeople dwell that no swarms of flies shall be there to the end thoumayest know that i am the lord in the midst of the earth and i will put a division between my people and thy people tomorrow shall this sign be and the lord did so and there came a grievous swarm of fliesinto the house of pharaoh and into his servants houses and into allthe land of egypt the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm offlies and pharaoh called for moses and for aaron and said go yesacrifice to your god in the land and moses said it is not meet so to do for we shall sacrificethe abomination of the egyptians to the lord our god lo shall wesacrifice the abomination of the egyptians before their eyes and willthey not stone us   we will go three days journey into thewilderness and sacrifice to the lord our god as he shall command us and pharaoh said i will let you go that ye may sacrifice to thelord your god in the wilderness only ye shall not go very far awayintreat for me and moses said behold i go out from thee and i will intreatthe lord that the swarms of flies may depart from pharaoh from hisservants and from his people to morrow but let not pharaoh dealdeceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to thelord and moses went out from pharaoh and intreated the lord and the lord did according to the word of moses and he removedthe swarms of flies from pharaoh from his servants and from hispeople there remained not one and pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also neither wouldhe let the people go then the lord said unto moses go in unto pharaoh and tell himthus saith the lord god of the hebrews let my people go that theymay serve me for if thou refuse to let them go and wilt hold them still behold the hand of the lord is upon thy cattle which is in the fieldupon the horses upon the asses upon the camels upon the oxen andupon the sheep there shall be a very grievous murrain and the lord shall sever between the cattle of israel and thecattle of egypt and there shall nothing die of all that is thechildrens of israel and the lord appointed a set time saying to morrow the lordshall do this thing in the land and the lord did that thing on the morrow and all the cattle ofegypt died but of the cattle of the children of israel died not one and pharaoh sent and behold there was not one of the cattle ofthe israelites dead and the heart of pharaoh was hardened and he didnot let the people go and the lord said unto moses and unto aaron take to you handfulsof ashes of the furnace and let moses sprinkle it toward the heavenin the sight of pharaoh and it shall become small dust in all the land of egypt and shallbe a boil breaking forth with blains upon man and upon beastthroughout all the land of egypt and they took ashes of the furnace and stood before pharaoh andmoses sprinkled it up toward heaven and it became a boil breakingforth with blains upon man and upon beast and the magicians could not stand before moses because of theboils for the boil was upon the magicians and upon all theegyptians and the lord hardened the heart of pharaoh and he hearkened notunto them as the lord had spoken unto moses and the lord said unto moses rise up early in the morning andstand before pharaoh and say unto him thus saith the lord god of thehebrews let my people go that they may serve me for i will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart andupon thy servants and upon thy people that thou mayest know thatthere is none like me in all the earth for now i will stretch out my hand that i may smite thee and thypeople with pestilence and thou shalt be cut off from the earth and in very deed for this cause have i raised thee up for toshew in thee my power and that my name may be declared throughout allthe earth as yet exaltest thou thyself against my people that thou wiltnot let them go   behold to morrow about this time i will causeit to rain a very grievous hail such as hath not been in egypt sincethe foundation thereof even until now send therefore now and gather thy cattle and all that thou hastin the field for upon every man and beast which shall be found in thefield and shall not be brought home the hail shall come down uponthem and they shall die he that feared the word of the lord among the servants of pharaohmade his servants and his cattle flee into the houses  and hethat regarded not the word of the lord left his servants and hiscattle in the field and the lord said unto moses stretch forth thine hand towardheaven that there may be hail in all the land of egypt upon man andupon beast and upon every herb of the field throughout the land ofegypt and moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven and the lordsent thunder and hail and the fire ran along upon the ground and thelord rained hail upon the land of egypt so there was hail and fire mingled with the hail very grievoussuch as there was none like it in all the land of egypt since itbecame a nation and the hail smote throughout all the land of egypt all that wasin the field both man and beast and the hail smote every herb of thefield and brake every tree of the field only in the land of goshen where the children of israel werewas there no hail and pharaoh sent and called for moses and aaron and said untothem i have sinned this time the lord is righteous and i and mypeople are wicked intreat the lord for it is enough that there be no more mightythunderings and hail and i will let you go and ye shall stay nolonger and moses said unto him as soon as i am gone out of the city iwill spread abroad my hands unto the lord and the thunder shallcease neither shall there be any more hail that thou mayest know howthat the earth is the lords but as for thee and thy servants i know that ye will not yetfear the lord god and the flax and the barley was smitten for the barley was inthe ear and the flax was bolled but the wheat and the rie were not smitten for they were notgrown up and moses went out of the city from pharaoh and spread abroadhis hands unto the lord and the thunders and hail ceased and therain was not poured upon the earth and when pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunderswere ceased he sinned yet more and hardened his heart he and hisservants and the heart of pharaoh was hardened neither would he let thechildren of israel go as the lord had spoken by moses and the lord said unto moses go in unto pharaoh for i havehardened his heart and the heart of his servants that i might shewthese my signs before him  and that thou mayest tell in the earsof thy son and of thy sons son what things i have wrought in egyptand my signs which i have done among them that ye may know how that iam the lord and moses and aaron came in unto pharaoh and said unto him thussaith the lord god of the hebrews how long wilt thou refuse to humblethyself before me let my people go that they may serve me else if thou refuse to let my people go behold to morrow willi bring the locusts into thy coast  and they shall cover the faceof the earth that one cannot be able to see the earth and they shalleat the residue of that which is escaped which remaineth unto youfrom the hail and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out ofthe field  and they shall fill thy houses and the houses of allthy servants and the houses of all the egyptians which neither thyfathers nor thy fathers fathers have seen since the day that theywere upon the earth unto this day and he turned himself and went outfrom pharaoh and pharaohs servants said unto him how long shall this man bea snare unto us let the men go that they may serve the lord theirgod knowest thou not yet that egypt is destroyed   and moses andaaron were brought again unto pharaoh and he said unto them goserve the lord your god but who are they that shall go   andmoses said we will go with our young and with our old with our sonsand with our daughters with our flocks and with our herds will we gofor we must hold a feast unto the lord and he said unto them let the lord be so with you as i willlet you go and your little ones look to it for evil is before you not so go now ye that are men and serve the lord for that yedid desire and they were driven out from pharaohs presence and the lord said unto moses stretch out thine hand over theland of egypt for the locusts that they may come up upon the land ofegypt and eat every herb of the land even all that the hail hathleft and moses stretched forth his rod over the land of egypt andthe lord brought an east wind upon the land all that day and all thatnight and when it was morning the east wind brought the locusts and the locust went up over all the land of egypt and rested inall the coasts of egypt very grievous were they before them therewere no such locusts as they neither after them shall be such for they covered the face of the whole earth so that the landwas darkened and they did eat every herb of the land and all thefruit of the trees which the hail had left and there remained not anygreen thing in the trees or in the herbs of the field through allthe land of egypt then pharaoh called for moses and aaron in haste and he said ihave sinned against the lord your god and against you now therefore forgive i pray thee my sin only this once andintreat the lord your god that he may take away from me this deathonly and he went out from pharaoh and intreated the lord and the lord turned a mighty strong west wind which took awaythe locusts and cast them into the red sea there remained not onelocust in all the coasts of egypt but the lord hardened pharaohs heart so that he would not letthe children of israel go and the lord said unto moses stretch out thine hand towardheaven that there may be darkness over the land of egypt evendarkness which may be felt and moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven and there wasa thick darkness in all the land of egypt three days  they sawnot one another neither rose any from his place for three days butall the children of israel had light in their dwellings and pharaoh called unto moses and said go ye serve the lordonly let your flocks and your herds be stayed let your little onesalso go with you and moses said thou must give us also sacrifices and burntofferings that we may sacrifice unto the lord our god our cattle also shall go with us there shall not an hoof beleft behind for thereof must we take to serve the lord our god andwe know not with what we must serve the lord until we come thither but the lord hardened pharaohs heart and he would not let themgo and pharaoh said unto him get thee from me take heed tothyself see my face no more for in that day thou seest my face thoushalt die and moses said thou hast spoken well i will see thy face againno more and the lord said unto moses yet will i bring one plague moreupon pharaoh and upon egypt afterwards he will let you go hencewhen he shall let you go he shall surely thrust you out hencealtogether speak now in the ears of the people and let every man borrow ofhis neighbour and every woman of her neighbour jewels of silver andjewels of gold and the lord gave the people favour in the sight of theegyptiansmoreover the man moses was very great in the land of egypt in thesight of pharaohs servants and in the sight of the people and moses said thus saith the lord about midnight will i go outinto the midst of egypt  and all the firstborn in the land ofegypt shall die from the first born of pharaoh that sitteth upon histhrone even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind themill and all the firstborn of beasts and there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of egyptsuch as there was none like it nor shall be like it any more but against any of the children of israel shall not a dog movehis tongue against man or beast that ye may know how that the lorddoth put a difference between the egyptians and israel and all these thy servants shall come down unto me and bow downthemselves unto me saying get thee out and all the people thatfollow thee and after that i will go out and he went out frompharaoh in a great anger and the lord said unto moses pharaoh shall not hearken unto youthat my wonders may be multiplied in the land of egypt and moses and aaron did all these wonders before pharaoh andthe lord hardened pharaohs heart so that he would not let thechildren of israel go out of his land and the lord spake unto moses and aaron in the land of egyptsaying  this month shall be unto you the beginning of months itshall be the first month of the year to you speak ye unto all the congregation of israel saying in thetenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lambaccording to the house of their fathers a lamb for an house  andif the household be too little for the lamb let him

shall say untoyou what mean ye by this service   that ye shall say it is thesacrifice of the lords passover who passed over the houses of thechildren of israel in egypt when he smote the egyptians anddelivered our houses and the people bowed the head and worshipped and the children of israel went away and did as the lord hadcommanded moses and aaron so did they and it came to pass that at midnight the lord smote all thefirstborn in the land of egypt from the firstborn of pharaoh that saton his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in thedungeon and all the firstborn of cattle and pharaoh rose up in the night he and all his servants andall the egyptians and there was a great cry in egypt for there wasnot a house where there was not one dead and he called for moses and aaron by night and said rise upand get you forth from among my people both ye and the children ofisrael and go serve the lord as ye have said also take your flocks and your herds as ye have said and begone and bless me also and the egyptians were urgent upon the people that they mightsend them out of the land in haste for they said we be all dead men and the people took their dough before it was leavened theirkneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders and the children of israel did according to the word of mosesand they borrowed of the egyptians jewels of silver and jewels ofgold and raiment  and the lord gave the people favour in thesight of the egyptians so that they lent unto them such things asthey required and they spoiled the egyptians and the children of israel journeyed from rameses to succothabout six hundred thousand on foot that were men beside children and a mixed multitude went up also with them and flocks andherds even very much cattle and they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they broughtforth out of egypt for it was not leavened because they were thrustout of egypt and could not tarry neither had they prepared forthemselves any victual now the sojourning of the children of israel who dwelt inegypt was four hundred and thirty years and it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirtyyears even the selfsame day it came to pass that all the hosts ofthe lord went out from the land of egypt it is a night to be much observed unto the lord for bringingthem out from the land of egypt this is that night of the lord to beobserved of all the children of israel in their generations and the lord said unto moses and aaron this is the ordinance ofthe passover there shall no stranger eat thereof  but everymans servant that is bought for money when thou hast circumcisedhim then shall he eat thereof a foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof in one house shall it be eaten thou shalt not carry forth oughtof the flesh abroad out of the house neither shall ye break a bonethereof all the congregation of israel shall keep it and when a stranger shall sojourn with thee and will keep thepassover to the lord let all his males be circumcised and then lethim come near and keep it and he shall be as one that is born in theland for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof one law shall be to him that is homeborn and unto the strangerthat sojourneth among you thus did all the children of israel as the lord commanded mosesand aaron so did they and it came to pass the selfsame day that the lord did bringthe children of israel out of the land of egypt by their armies and the lord spake unto moses saying  sanctify unto me allthe firstborn whatsoever openeth the womb among the children ofisrael both of man and of beast it is mine and moses said unto the people remember this day in which yecame out from egypt out of the house of bondage for by strength ofhand the lord brought you out from this place there shall no leavenedbread be eaten this day came ye out in the month abib and it shall be when the lord shall bring thee into the land ofthe canaanites and the hittites and the amorites and the hivitesand the jebusites which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee aland flowing with milk and honey that thou shalt keep this service inthis month seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread and in the seventhday shall be a feast to the lord unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days and there shall noleavened bread be seen with thee neither shall there be leaven seenwith thee in all thy quarters and thou shalt shew thy son in that day saying this is donebecause of that which the lord did unto me when i came forth out ofegypt and it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand and for amemorial between thine eyes that the lords law may be in thy mouthfor with a strong hand hath the lord brought thee out of egypt thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from yearto year and it shall be when the lord shall bring thee into the land ofthe canaanites as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers and shallgive it thee  that thou shalt set apart unto the lord all thatopeneth the matrix and every firstling that cometh of a beast whichthou hast the males shall be the lords and every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb andif thou wilt not redeem it then thou shalt break his neck and allthe firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeem and it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to comesaying what is this that thou shalt say unto him by strength ofhand the lord brought us out from egypt from the house of bondage and it came to pass when pharaoh would hardly let us go thatthe lord slew all the firstborn in the land of egypt both thefirstborn of man and the firstborn of beast therefore i sacrifice tothe lord all that openeth the matrix being males but all thefirstborn of my children i redeem and it shall be for a token upon thine hand and for frontletsbetween thine eyes for by strength of hand the lord brought us forthout of egypt and it came to pass when pharaoh had let the people go thatgod led them not through the way of the land of the philistinesalthough that was near for god said lest peradventure the peoplerepent when they see war and they return to egypt  but god ledthe people about through the way of the wilderness of the red seaand the children of israel went up harnessed out of the land of egypt and moses took the bones of joseph with him for he had straitlysworn the children of israel saying god will surely visit you andye shall carry up my bones away hence with you and they took their journey from succoth and encamped in ethamin the edge of the wilderness and the lord went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud tolead them the way and by night in a pillar of fire to give themlight to go by day and night  he took not away the pillar ofthe cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night from before thepeople and the lord spake unto moses saying  speak unto thechildren of israel that they turn and encamp before pihahirothbetween migdol and the sea over against baalzephon before it shallye encamp by the sea for pharaoh will say of the children of israel they areentangled in the land the wilderness hath shut them in and i will harden pharaohs heart that he shall follow afterthem and i will be honoured upon pharaoh and upon all his host thatthe egyptians may know that i am the lord and they did so and it was told the king of egypt that the people fled and theheart of pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the peopleand they said why have we done this that we have let israel go fromserving us   and he made ready his chariot and took his peoplewith him  and he took six hundred chosen chariots and all thechariots of egypt and captains over every one of them and the lord hardened the heart of pharaoh king of egypt and hepursued after the children of israel and the children of israel wentout with an high hand but the egyptians pursued after them all the horses and chariotsof pharaoh and his horsemen and his army and overtook themencamping by the sea beside pihahiroth before baalzephon and when pharaoh drew nigh the children of israel lifted uptheir eyes and behold the egyptians marched after them and theywere sore afraid and the children of israel cried out unto the lord and they said unto moses because there were no graves in egypthast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness wherefore hast thoudealt thus with us to carry us forth out of egypt   is not thisthe word that we did tell thee in egypt saying let us alone that wemay serve the egyptians for it had been better for us to serve theegyptians than that we should die in the wilderness and moses said unto the people fear ye not stand still andsee the salvation of the lord which he will shew to you to day forthe egyptians whom ye have seen to day ye shall see them again nomore for ever the lord shall fight for you and ye shall hold your peace and the lord said unto moses wherefore criest thou unto mespeak unto the children of israel that they go forward  butlift thou up thy rod and stretch out thine hand over the sea anddivide it and the children of israel shall go on dry ground throughthe midst of the sea and i behold i will harden the hearts of the egyptians andthey shall follow them and i will get me honour upon pharaoh andupon all his host upon his chariots and upon his horsemen and the egyptians shall know that i am the lord when i havegotten me honour upon pharaoh upon his chariots and upon hishorsemen and the angel of god which went before the camp of israelremoved and went behind them and the pillar of the cloud went frombefore their face and stood behind them  and it came betweenthe camp of the egyptians and the camp of israel and it was a cloudand darkness to them but it gave light by night to these so that theone came not near the other all the night and moses stretched out his hand over the sea and the lordcaused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night andmade the sea dry land and the waters were divided and the children of israel went into the midst of the sea uponthe dry ground and the waters were a wall unto them on their righthand and on their left and the egyptians pursued and went in after them to the midstof the sea even all pharaohs horses his chariots and his horsemen and it came to pass that in the morning watch the lord lookedunto the host of the egyptians through the pillar of fire and of thecloud and troubled the host of the egyptians  and took offtheir chariot wheels that they drave them heavily so that theegyptians said let us flee from the face of israel for the lordfighteth for them against the egyptians and the lord said unto moses stretch out thine hand over thesea that the waters may come again upon the egyptians upon theirchariots and upon their horsemen and moses stretched forth his hand over the sea and the seareturned to his strength when the morning appeared and the egyptiansfled against it and the lord overthrew the egyptians in the midst ofthe sea and the waters returned and covered the chariots and thehorsemen and all the host of pharaoh that came into the sea afterthem there remained not so much as one of them but the children of israel walked upon dry land in the midst ofthe sea and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand andon their left thus the lord saved israel that day out of the hand of theegyptians and israel saw the egyptians dead upon the sea shore and israel saw that great work which the lord did upon theegyptians and the people feared the lord and believed the lord andhis servant moses then sang moses and the children of israel this song unto thelord and spake saying i will sing unto the lord for he hathtriumphed gloriously the horse and his rider hath he thrown into thesea the lord is my strength and song and he is become my salvationhe is my god and i will prepare him an habitation my fathers godand i will exalt him the lord is a man of war the lord is his name pharaohs chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea hischosen captains also are drowned in the red sea the depths have covered them they sank into the bottom as astone thy right hand o lord is become glorious in power thy righthand o lord hath dashed in pieces the enemy and in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrownthem that rose up against thee thou sentest forth thy wrath whichconsumed them as stubble and with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gatheredtogether the floods stood upright as an heap and the depths werecongealed in the heart of the sea the enemy said i will pursue i will overtake i will divide thespoil my lust shall be satisfied upon them i will draw my sword myhand shall destroy them thou didst blow with thy wind the sea covered them they sankas lead in the mighty waters who is like unto thee o lord among the gods who is like theeglorious in holiness fearful in praises doing wonders   thoustretchedst out thy right hand the earth swallowed them thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hastredeemed thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holyhabitation the people shall hear and be afraid sorrow shall take hold onthe inhabitants of palestina then the dukes of edom shall be amazed the mighty men of moabtrembling shall take hold upon them all the inhabitants of canaanshall melt away fear and dread shall fall upon them by the greatness of thinearm they shall be as still as a stone till thy people pass over olord till the people pass over which thou hast purchased thou shalt bring them in and plant them in the mountain ofthine inheritance in the place o lord which thou hast made for theeto dwell in in the sanctuary o lord which thy hands haveestablished the lord shall reign for ever and ever for the horse of pharaoh went in with his chariots and with hishorsemen into the sea and the lord brought again the waters of thesea upon them but the children of israel went on dry land in themidst of the sea and miriam the prophetess the sister of aaron took a timbrelin her hand and all the women went out after her with timbrels andwith dances and miriam answered them sing ye to the lord for he hathtriumphed gloriously the horse and his rider hath he thrown into thesea so moses brought israel from the red sea and they went out intothe wilderness of shur and they went three days in the wildernessand found no water and when they came to marah they could not drink of the watersof marah for they were bitter therefore the name of it was calledmarah and the people murmured against moses saying what shall wedrink   and he cried unto the lord and the lord shewed him atree which when he had cast into the waters the waters were madesweet there he made for them a statute and an ordinance and there heproved them  and said if thou wilt diligently hearken to thevoice of the lord thy god and wilt do that which is right in hissight and wilt give ear to his commandments and keep all hisstatutes i will put none of these diseases upon thee which i havebrought upon the egyptians for i am the lord that healeth thee and they came to elim where were twelve wells of water andthreescore and ten palm trees and they encamped there by the waters and they took their journey from elim and all the congregationof the children of israel came unto the wilderness of sin which isbetween elim and sinai on the fifteenth day of the second month aftertheir departing out of the land of egypt and the whole congregation of the children of israel murmuredagainst moses and aaron in the wilderness  and the children ofisrael said unto them would to god we had died by the hand of thelord in the land of egypt when we sat by the flesh pots and when wedid eat bread to the full for ye have brought us forth into thiswilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger then said the lord unto moses behold i will rain bread fromheaven for you and the people shall go out and gather a certain rateevery day that i may prove them whether they will walk in my law orno and it shall come to pass that on the sixth day they shallprepare that which they bring in and it shall be twice as much asthey gather daily and moses and aaron said unto all the children of israel ateven then ye shall know that the lord hath brought you out from theland of egypt  and in the morning then ye shall see the glory ofthe lord for that he heareth your murmurings against the lord andwhat are we that ye murmur against us   and moses said thisshall be when the lord shall give you in the evening flesh to eatand in the morning bread to the full for that the lord heareth yourmurmurings which ye murmur against him and what are we yourmurmurings are not against us but against the lord and moses spake unto aaron say unto all the congregation of thechildren of israel come near before the lord for he hath heard yourmurmurings and it came to pass as aaron spake unto the whole congregationof the children of israel that they looked toward the wildernessand behold the glory of the lord appeared in the cloud and the lord spake unto moses saying  i have heard themurmurings of the children of israel speak unto them saying at evenye shall eat flesh and in the morning ye shall be filled with breadand ye shall know that i am the lord your god and it came to pass that at even the quails came up andcovered the camp and in the morning the dew lay round about the host and when the dew that lay was gone up behold upon the face ofthe wilderness there lay a small round thing as small as the hoarfrost on the ground and when the children of israel saw it they said one toanother it is manna for they wist not what it was and moses saidunto them this is the bread which the lord hath given you to eat this is the thing which the lord hath commanded gather of itevery man according to his eating an omer for every man according tothe number of your persons take ye every man for them which are inhis tents and the children of israel did so and gathered some more someless and when they did mete it with an omer he that gathered muchhad nothing over and he that gathered little had no lack theygathered every man according to his eating and moses said let no man leave of it till the morning notwithstanding they hearkened not unto moses but some of themleft of it until the morning and it bred worms and stank and moseswas wroth with them and they gathered it every morning every man according to hiseating and when the sun waxed hot it melted and it came to pass that on the sixth day they gathered twiceas much bread two omers for one man and all the rulers of thecongregation came and told moses and he said unto them this is that which the lord hath said tomorrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the lord bake that whichye will bake to day and seethe that ye will seethe and that whichremaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning and they laid it up till the morning as moses bade and it didnot stink neither was there any worm therein and moses said eat that to day for to day is a sabbath untothe lord to day ye shall not find it in the field six days ye shall gather it but on the seventh day which isthe sabbath in it there shall be none and it came to pass that there went out some of the people onthe seventh day for to gather and they found none and the lord said unto moses how long refuse ye to keep mycommandments and my laws   see for that the lord hath given youthe sabbath therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of twodays abide ye every man in his place let no man go out of his placeon the seventh day so the people rested on the seventh day and the house of israel called the name thereof manna and itwas like coriander seed white and the taste of it was like wafersmade with honey and moses said this is the thing which the lord commandethfill an omer of it to be kept for your generations that they may seethe bread wherewith i have fed you in the wilderness when i broughtyou forth from the land of egypt and moses said unto aaron take a pot and put an omer full ofmanna therein and lay it up before the lord to be kept for yourgenerations as the lord commanded moses so aaron laid it up before thetestimony to be kept and the children of israel did eat manna forty years until theycame to a land inhabited they did eat manna until they came unto theborders of the land of canaan now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah and all the congregation of the children of israel journeyed fromthe wilderness of sin after their journeys according to thecommandment of the lord and pitched in rephidim and there was nowater for the people to drink wherefore the people did chide with moses and said give uswater that we may drink and moses said unto them why chide ye withme wherefore do ye tempt the lord   and the people thirstedthere for water and the people murmured against moses and saidwherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of egypt to killus and our children and our cattle with thirst   and moses criedunto the lord saying what shall i do unto this people they bealmost ready to stone me and the lord said unto moses go on before the people and takewith thee of the elders of israel and thy rod wherewith thou smotestthe river take in thine hand and go behold i will stand before thee there upon the rock in horeband thou shalt smite the rock and there shall come water out of itthat the people may drink and moses did so in the sight of the eldersof israel and he called the name of the place massah and meribah becauseof the chiding of the children of israel and because they tempted thelord saying is the lord among us or not   then came amalekand fought with israel in rephidim and moses said unto joshua choose us out men and go out fightwith amalek to morrow i will stand on the top of the hill with therod of god in mine hand so joshua did as moses had said to him and fought with amalekand moses aaron and hur went up to the top of the hill and it came to pass when moses held up his hand that israelprevailed and when he let down his hand amalek prevailed but moses hands were heavy and they took a stone and put itunder him and he sat thereon and aaron and hur stayed up his handsthe one on the one side and the other on the other side and hishands were steady until the going down of the sun and joshua discomfited amalek and his people with the edge ofthe sword and the lord said unto moses write this for a memorial in abook and rehearse it in the ears of joshua for i will utterly putout the remembrance of amalek from under heaven and moses built an altar and called the name of itjehovahnissi  for he said because the lord hath sworn that thelord will have war with amalek from generation to generation when jethro the priest of midian moses father in law heard ofall that god had done for moses and for israel his people and thatthe lord had brought israel out of egypt  then jethro mosesfather in law took zipporah moses wife after he had sent her back and her two sons of which the name of the one was gershom forhe said i have been an alien in a strange land  and the name ofthe other was eliezer for the god of my father said he was minehelp and delivered me from the sword of pharaoh  and jethromoses father in law came with his sons and his wife unto moses intothe wilderness where he encamped at the mount of god  and hesaid unto moses i thy father in law jethro am come unto thee and thywife and her two sons with her and moses went out to meet his father in law and did obeisanceand kissed him and they asked each other of their welfare and theycame into the tent and moses told his father in law all that the lord had done untopharaoh and to the egyptians for israels sake and all the travailthat had come upon them by the way and how the lord delivered them and jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the lord had doneto israel whom he had delivered out of the hand of the egyptians and jethro said blessed be the lord who hath delivered you outof the hand of the egyptians and out of the hand of pharaoh who hathdelivered the people from under the hand of the egyptians now i know that the lord is greater than all gods for in thething wherein they dealt proudly he was above them and jethro moses father in law took a burnt offering andsacrifices for god and aaron came and all the elders of israel toeat bread with moses father in law before god and it came to pass on the morrow that moses sat to judge thepeople and the people stood by moses from the morning unto theevening and when moses father in law saw all that he did to the peoplehe said what is this thing that thou doest to the people why sittestthou thyself alone and all the people stand by thee from morning untoeven   and moses said unto his father in law because the peoplecome unto me to enquire of god  when they have a matter theycome unto me and i judge between one and another and i do make themknow the statutes of god and his laws and moses father in law said unto him the thing that thoudoest is not good thou wilt surely wear away both thou and this people that iswith thee for this thing is too heavy for thee thou art not able toperform it thyself alone hearken now unto my voice i will give thee counsel and godshall be with thee be thou for the people to godward that thoumayest bring the causes unto god  and thou shalt teach themordinances and laws and shalt shew them the way wherein they mustwalk and the work that they must do moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men suchas fear god men of truth hating covetousness and place such overthem to be rulers of thousands and rulers of hundreds rulers offifties and rulers of tens  and let them judge the people atall seasons and it shall be that every great matter they shall bringunto thee but every small matter they shall judge so shall it beeasier for thyself and they shall bear the burden with thee if thou shalt do this thing and god command thee so then thoushalt be able to endure and all this people shall also go to theirplace in peace so moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law and didall that he had said and moses chose able men out of all israel and made them headsover the people rulers of thousands rulers of hundreds rulers offifties and rulers of tens and they judged the people at all seasons the hard causes theybrought unto moses but every small matter they judged themselves and moses let his father in law depart and he went his way intohis own land in the third month when the children of israel were gone forthout of the land of egypt the same day came they into the wildernessof sinai for they were departed from rephidim and were come to the desertof sinai and had pitched in the wilderness and there israel campedbefore the mount and moses went up unto god and the lord called unto him out ofthe mountain saying thus shalt thou say to the house of jacob andtell the children of israel  ye have seen what i did unto theegyptians and how i bare you on eagles wings and brought you untomyself now therefore if ye will obey my voice indeed and keep mycovenant then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above allpeople for all the earth is mine  and ye shall be unto me akingdom of priests and an holy nationthese are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children ofisrael and moses came and called for the elders of the people and laidbefore their faces all these words which the lord commanded him and all the people answered together and said all that the lordhath spoken we will do and moses returned the words of the peopleunto the lord and the lord said unto moses lo i come unto thee in a thickcloud that the people may hear when i speak with thee and believethee for everand moses told the words of the people unto the lord and the lord said unto moses go unto the people and sanctifythem to day and to morrow and let them wash their clothes  andbe ready against the third day for the third day the lord will comedown in the sight of all the people upon mount sinai and thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about sayingtake heed to yourselves that ye go not up into the mount or touchthe border of it whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put todeath  there shall not an hand touch it but he shall surely bestoned or shot through whether it be beast or man it shall notlive when the trumpet soundeth long they shall come up to the mount and moses went down from the mount unto the people andsanctified the people and they washed their clothes and he said unto the people be ready against the third daycome not at your wives and it came to pass on the third day in the morning that therewere thunders and lightnings and a thick cloud upon the mount andthe voice of the trumpet exceeding loud so that all the people thatwas in the camp trembled and moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet withgod and they stood at the nether part of the mount and mount sinai was altogether on a smoke because the lorddescended upon it in fire and the smoke thereof ascended as the smokeof a furnace and the whole mount quaked greatly and when the voice of the trumpet sounded long and waxed louderand louder moses spake and god answered him by a voice and the lord came down upon mount sinai on the top of themount and the lord called moses up to the top of the mount and moseswent up and the lord said unto moses go down charge the people lestthey break through unto the lord to gaze and many of them perish and let the priests also which come near to the lord sanctifythemselves lest the lord break forth upon them and moses said unto the lord the people cannot come up to mountsinai for thou chargedst us saying set bounds about the mount andsanctify it and the lord said unto him away get thee down and thou shaltcome up thou and aaron with thee but let not the priests and thepeople break through to come up unto the lord lest he break forthupon them so moses went down unto the people and spake unto them and god spake all these words saying  i am the lord thygod which have brought thee out of the land of egypt out of thehouse of bondage thou shalt have no other gods before me thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image or any likenessof any thing that is in heaven above or that is in the earth beneathor that is in the water under the earth thou shalt not bow down thyself to them nor serve them for ithe lord thy god am a jealous god visiting the iniquity of thefathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of themthat hate me  and shewing mercy unto thousands of them that loveme and keep my commandments thou shalt not take the name of the lord thy god in vain for thelord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain remember the sabbath day to keep it holy six days shalt thou labour and do all thy work  but theseventh day is the sabbath of the lord thy god in it thou shalt notdo any work thou nor thy

thou shalt not commit adultery thou shalt not steal thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour thou shalt not covet thy neighbours house thou shalt not covetthy neighbours wife nor his manservant nor his maidservant nor hisox nor his ass nor any thing that is thy neighbours and all the people saw the thunderings and the lightnings andthe noise of the trumpet and the mountain smoking and when thepeople saw it they removed and stood afar off and they said unto moses speak thou with us and we will hearbut let not god speak with us lest we die and moses said unto the people fear not for god is come toprove you and that his fear may be before your faces that ye sinnot and the people stood afar off and moses drew near unto thethick darkness where god was and the lord said unto moses thus thou shalt say unto thechildren of israel ye have seen that i have talked with you fromheaven ye shall not make with me gods of silver neither shall ye makeunto you gods of gold an altar of

gods which shall go before us for as forthis moses the man that brought us up out of the land of egypt wewot not what is become of him and aaron said unto them break off the golden earrings whichare in the ears of your wives of your sons and of your daughtersand bring them unto me and all the people brake off the golden earrings which were intheir ears and brought them unto aaron and he received

thee up out of the land of egypt and the lord said unto moses i have seen this people andbehold it is a stiffnecked people  now therefore let me alonethat my wrath may wax hot against them and that i may consume themand i will make of thee a great nation and moses besought the lord his god and said lord why doththy wrath wax hot against thy people which thou hast brought forthout of the land of egypt with great power and with a mighty hand wherefore should the egyptians speak and say for mischief didhe bring them out to slay them in the mountains and to consume themfrom the face of the earth turn from thy fierce wrath and repent ofthis evil against thy people remember abraham isaac and israel thy servants to whom thouswarest by thine own self and saidst unto them i will multiply yourseed

camp and he said it is not the voice of them that shout for masteryneither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome but thenoise of them that sing do i hear and it came to pass as soon as he came nigh unto the camp thathe saw the calf and the dancing and moses anger waxed hot and hecast the tables out of his hands and brake them beneath the mount and he took the calf which they had made and burnt it in thefire and ground it to powder and strawed it upon the water and madethe children of israel drink of it and moses said unto aaron what did this people unto thee thatthou hast brought so great a sin upon them   and aaron said letnot the anger of my lord wax hot thou knowest the people that theyare set on mischief for they said unto me make us gods which shall go before usfor as for this moses the man that brought us up out of the land ofegypt we wot not what is become of him and i said unto them whosoever hath any gold let them break itoff so they gave it me then i cast it into the fire and there cameout this calf and when moses saw that the people were naked for aaron hadmade them naked unto their shame among their enemies  thenmoses stood in the gate of the camp and said who is on the lordsside let him come unto me and all the sons of levi gatheredthemselves together unto him and he said unto them thus saith the lord god of israel putevery man his sword by his side and go in and out from gate to gatethroughout the camp and slay every man his brother and every man hiscompanion and every man his neighbour and the children of levi did according to the word of moses andthere fell of the people that day about three thousand men for moses had said consecrate yourselves today to the lordeven every man upon his son and upon his brother that he may bestowupon you a blessing this day and it came to pass on the morrow that moses said unto thepeople ye have sinned a great sin and now i will go up unto thelord peradventure i shall make an atonement for your sin and moses returned unto the lord and said oh this people havesinned a great sin and have made them gods of gold yet now if thou wilt forgive their sin and if not blot mei pray thee out of thy book which thou hast written and the lord said unto moses whosoever hath sinned against mehim will i blot out of my book therefore now go lead the people unto the place of which i havespoken unto thee behold mine angel shall go before theenevertheless in the day when i visit i will visit their sin upon them and the lord plagued the people because they made the calfwhich aaron made and the lord said unto moses depart and go up hence thou andthe people which thou hast brought up out of the land of egypt untothe land which i sware unto abraham to isaac and to jacob sayingunto thy seed will i give it  and i will send an angel beforethee and i will drive out the canaanite the amorite and thehittite and the perizzite the hivite and the jebusite  unto aland flowing with milk and honey for i will not go up in the midst ofthee for thou art a stiffnecked people lest i consume thee in theway and when the people heard these evil tidings they mourned andno man did put on him his ornaments for the lord had said unto moses say unto the children ofisrael ye are a stiffnecked people i will come up into the midst ofthee in a moment and consume thee therefore now put off thyornaments from thee that i may know what to do unto thee and the children of israel stripped themselves of their ornamentsby the mount horeb and moses took the tabernacle and pitched it without the campafar off from the

wherein shall it be known here that i and thy people havefound grace in thy sight is it not in that thou goest with us soshall we be separated i and thy people from all the people that areupon the face of the earth and the lord said unto moses i will do this thing also thatthou hast spoken for thou hast found grace in my sight and i knowthee by name and he said i beseech thee shew me thy glory and he said i will make all my goodness pass before thee and iwill proclaim the name of the lord before thee and will be graciousto whom i will be gracious and will shew mercy on whom i will shewmercy and he said thou canst not see my face for there shall no mansee me and live and the lord said behold there is a place by me and thoushalt stand upon a rock  and it shall come to pass while myglory

children ofisrael which they bring unto the priest shall be his and every mans hallowed things shall be his whatsoever any mangiveth the priest it shall be his and the lord spake unto moses saying  speak unto thechildren of israel and say unto them if any mans wife go aside andcommit a trespass against him  and a man lie with her carnallyand it be hid from the eyes of her husband and be kept close and shebe defiled and there be no witness against her neither she be takenwith the manner  and the spirit of jealousy come upon him and hebe jealous of his wife and she be defiled or if the spirit ofjealousy come upon him and he be jealous of his wife and she be notdefiled  then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest andhe shall bring her offering for her the tenth part of an ephah ofbarley meal he shall pour no oil upon it nor put frankincensethereon for it is an offering of jealousy an offering of memorialbringing iniquity to remembrance and the priest shall bring her near and

thou free fromthis bitter water that causeth the curse  but if thou hast goneaside to another instead of thy husband and if thou be defiled andsome man have lain with thee beside thine husband  then

givelight over against the candlestick and aaron did so he lighted the lamps thereof over against thecandlestick as the lord commanded moses and this work of the candlestick was of beaten gold unto theshaft thereof unto the flowers thereof was beaten work accordingunto the pattern which the lord had shewed moses so he made thecandlestick and the lord spake unto moses saying  take the levites fromamong the children of israel and cleanse them and thus shalt thou do unto them to cleanse them sprinkle waterof purifying upon them and let them shave all their flesh and letthem wash their clothes and so make themselves clean then let them take a young bullock with his meat offering evenfine flour mingled with oil and another young bullock shalt thou takefor a sin offering and thou shalt bring the levites before the tabernacle of thecongregation and thou shalt gather the whole assembly of the childrenof israel together  and thou shalt bring the levites before thelord and the

the levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of thebullocks and thou shalt offer the one for a sin offering and theother for a burnt offering unto the lord to make an atonement forthe levites and thou shalt set the levites before aaron and before his sonsand offer them for an offering unto the lord thus shalt thou separate the levites from among the children ofisrael and the levites shall be mine and after that shall the levites go in to do the service of thetabernacle of the congregation and thou shalt cleanse them and offerthem for an offering for they are wholly given unto me from among the children ofisrael instead of such as open every womb even instead of thefirstborn of all the children of israel have i taken them unto me for all the firstborn of the children of israel are mine bothman and beast on the day that i smote every firstborn in the land ofegypt i sanctified them for myself and i have taken the levites for all the firstborn of thechildren of israel and i have given the levites as a gift to aaron and to his sonsfrom among the children of israel to do the service of the childrenof israel in the tabernacle of the congregation and to make anatonement for the children of israel that there be no plague amongthe children of israel when the children of israel come nigh unto thesanctuary and moses and aaron and all the congregation of the children ofisrael did

offered them as an offering before the lord and aaron made anatonement for them to cleanse them and after that went the levites in to do their service in thetabernacle of the congregation before aaron and before his sons asthe lord had commanded moses concerning the levites so did they untothem and the lord spake unto moses saying  this is it thatbelongeth unto the levites from twenty and five years old and upwardthey shall go in to wait upon the service of the tabernacle of thecongregation  and from the age of fifty years they shall ceasewaiting upon the service thereof and shall serve no more  butshall minister with their brethren in the tabernacle of thecongregation to keep the charge and shall do no service thus shaltthou do unto the levites touching their charge and the lord spake unto moses in the wilderness of sinai in thefirst month of the second year after they were come out of the land ofegypt saying  let the children of israel also keep the passoverat his appointed season in the fourteenth day of this month at even ye shall keep it inhis appointed season according to all the rites of it and accordingto all the ceremonies thereof shall ye keep it and moses spake unto the children of israel that they should keepthe passover and they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the firstmonth at even in the wilderness of sinai according to all that thelord commanded moses so did the children of israel and there were certain men who were defiled by the dead body of aman that they could not keep the passover on that day and they camebefore moses and before aaron on that day  and those men said untohim we are defiled by the dead body of a man wherefore are we keptback that we may not offer an offering of the lord in his appointedseason among the children of israel   and moses said unto themstand still and i will hear what the lord will command concerningyou and the lord spake unto moses saying  speak unto thechildren of israel saying if any man of you or of your posterityshall be unclean by reason of a dead body or be in a journey afaroff yet he shall keep the passover unto the lord the fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keepit and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs they shall leave none of it unto the morning nor break any boneof it according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keepit but the man that is clean and is not in a journey andforbeareth to keep the passover even the same soul shall be cut offfrom among his people because he brought not the offering of the lordin his appointed season that man shall bear his sin and if a stranger shall sojourn among you and will keep thepassover unto the lord according to the ordinance of the passoverand according to the manner thereof so shall he do ye shall have oneordinance both for the stranger and for him that was born in theland and on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloudcovered the tabernacle namely the tent of the testimony and at eventhere was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire untilthe morning so it was alway the cloud covered it by day and the appearanceof fire by night and when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle then afterthat the children of israel journeyed and in the place where thecloud abode there the children of israel pitched their tents at the commandment of the lord the children of israel journeyedand at the commandment of the lord they pitched as long as the cloudabode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents and when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many daysthen the children of israel kept the charge of the lord and journeyednot and so it was when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacleaccording to the commandment of the lord they abode in their tentsand according to the commandment of the lord they journeyed and so it was when the cloud abode from even unto the morningand that the cloud was taken up in the morning then they journeyedwhether it was by day or by night that the cloud was taken up theyjourneyed or whether it were two days or a month or a year that thecloud tarried upon the tabernacle remaining thereon the children ofisrael abode in their tents and journeyed not but when it was takenup they journeyed at the commandment of the lord they rested in the tents and atthe commandment of the lord they journeyed they kept the charge ofthe lord at the commandment of the lord by the hand of moses and the lord spake unto moses saying  make thee twotrumpets of silver of a whole piece shalt thou make them that thoumayest use them for the calling of the assembly and for thejourneying of the camps and when they shall blow with them all the assembly shallassemble themselves to thee at the door of the tabernacle of thecongregation and if they blow but with one trumpet then the princes whichare heads of the thousands of israel shall gather themselves untothee when ye blow an alarm then the camps that lie on the east partsshall go forward when ye blow an alarm the second time then the camps that lie onthe south side shall take their journey they shall blow an alarm fortheir journeys but when the congregation is to be gathered together ye shallblow but ye shall not sound an alarm and the sons of aaron the priests shall blow with the trumpetsand they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever throughout yourgenerations and if ye go to war in your land against the enemy thatoppresseth you then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets and yeshall be remembered before the lord your god and ye shall be savedfrom your enemies also in the day of your gladness and in your solemn days andin the beginnings of your months ye shall blow with the trumpets overyour burnt offerings and over the sacrifices of your peace offeringsthat they may be to you for a memorial before your god i am the lordyour god and it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month inthe second year that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacleof the testimony and the children of israel took their journeys out of thewilderness of sinai and the cloud rested in the wilderness of paran and they first took their journey according to the commandmentof the lord by the hand of moses in the first place went the standard of the camp of the childrenof judah according to their armies and over his host was nahshon theson of amminadab and over the host of the tribe of the children of issachar wasnethaneel the son of zuar and over the host of the tribe of the children of zebulun waseliab the son of helon and the tabernacle was taken down and the sons of gershon andthe sons of merari set forward bearing the tabernacle and the standard of the camp of reuben set forward according totheir armies and over his host was elizur the son of shedeur and over the host of the tribe of the children of simeon wasshelumiel the son of zurishaddai and over the host of the tribe of the children of gad waseliasaph the son of deuel and the kohathites set forward bearing the sanctuary and theother did set up the tabernacle against they came and the standard of the camp of the children of ephraim setforward according to their armies and over his host was elishama theson of ammihud and over the host of the tribe of the children of manasseh wasgamaliel the son of pedahzur and over the host of the tribe of the children of benjamin wasabidan the son of gideoni and the standard of the camp of the children of dan set forwardwhich was the rereward of all the camps throughout their hosts andover his host was ahiezer the son of ammishaddai and over the host of the tribe of the children of asher waspagiel the son of ocran and over the host of the tribe of the children of naphtali wasahira the son of enan thus were the journeyings of the children of israel according totheir armies when they set forward and moses said unto hobab the son of raguel the midianitemoses father in law we are journeying unto the place of which thelord said i will give it you come thou with us and we will do theegood for the lord hath spoken good concerning israel and he said unto him i will not go but i will depart to mineown land and to my kindred and he said leave us not i pray thee forasmuch as thouknowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness and thou mayest be tous instead of eyes and it shall be if thou go with us yea it shall be that whatgoodness the lord shall do unto us the same will we do unto thee and they departed from the mount of the lord three daysjourney and the ark of the covenant of the lord went before them inthe three days journey to search out a resting place for them and the cloud of the lord was upon them by day when they wentout of the camp and it came to pass when the ark set forward that moses saidrise up lord and let thine enemies be scattered and let them thathate thee flee before thee and when it rested he said return o lord unto the manythousands of israel and when the people complained it displeased the lord and thelord heard it and his anger was kindled and the fire of the lordburnt among them and consumed them that were in the uttermost partsof the camp and the people cried unto moses and when moses prayed unto thelord the fire was quenched and he called the name of the place taberah because the fire ofthe lord burnt among them and the mixt multitude that was among them fell a lusting andthe children of israel also wept again and said who shall give usflesh to eat   we remember the fish which we did eat in egyptfreely the cucumbers and the melons and the leeks and the onionsand the garlick  but now our soul is dried away there is nothingat all beside this manna before our eyes and the manna was as coriander seed and the colour thereof asthe colour of bdellium and the people went about and gathered it and ground it inmills or beat it in a mortar and baked it in pans and made cakes ofit and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil and when the dew fell upon the camp in the night the manna fellupon it then moses heard the people weep throughout their familiesevery man in the door of his tent and the anger of the lord waskindled greatly moses also was displeased and moses said unto the lord wherefore hast thou afflicted thyservant and wherefore have i not found favour in thy sight that thoulayest the burden of all this people upon me   have i conceivedall this people have i begotten them that thou shouldest say untome carry them in thy bosom as a nursing father beareth the suckingchild unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers  whence should i have flesh to give unto all this people for they weepunto me saying give us flesh that we may eat i am not able to bear all this people alone because it is tooheavy for me and if thou deal thus with me kill me i pray thee out ofhand if i have found favour in thy sight and let me not see mywretchedness and the lord said unto moses gather unto me seventy men of theelders of israel whom thou knowest to be the elders of the peopleand officers over them and bring them unto the tabernacle of thecongregation that they may stand there with thee and i will come down and talk with thee there and i will takeof the spirit which is upon thee and will put it upon them and theyshall bear the burden of the people with thee that thou bear it notthyself alone and say thou unto the people sanctify yourselves against tomorrow and ye shall eat flesh for ye have wept in the ears of thelord saying who shall give us flesh to eat for it was well with usin egypt therefore the lord will give you flesh and ye shall eat ye shall not eat one day nor two days nor five days neitherten days nor twenty days  but even a whole month until it comeout at your nostrils and it be loathsome unto you because that yehave despised the lord which is among you and have wept before himsaying why came we forth out of egypt   and moses said thepeople among whom i am are six hundred thousand footmen and thouhast said i will give them flesh that they may eat a whole month shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them to sufficethem  or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for themto suffice them   and the lord said unto moses is the lordshand waxed short thou shalt see now whether my word shall come topass unto thee or not and moses went out and told the people the words of the lordand gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people and set themround about the tabernacle and the lord came down in a cloud and spake unto him and tookof the spirit that was upon him and gave it unto the seventy eldersand it came to pass that when the spirit rested upon them theyprophesied and did not cease but there remained two of the men in the camp the name of theone was eldad and the name of the other medad and the spirit restedupon them and they were of them that were written but went not outunto the tabernacle and they prophesied in the camp and there ran a young man and told moses and said eldad andmedad do prophesy in the camp and joshua the son of nun the servant of moses one of hisyoung men answered and said my lord moses forbid them and moses said unto him enviest thou for my sake would godthat all the lords people were prophets and that the lord would puthis spirit upon them   and moses gat him into the camp he andthe elders of israel and there went forth a wind from the lord and brought quailsfrom the sea and let them fall by the camp as it were a daysjourney on this side and as it were a days journey on the otherside round about the camp and as it were two cubits high upon theface of the earth and the people stood up all that day and all that night andall the next day and they gathered the quails he that gathered leastgathered ten homers and they spread them all abroad for themselvesround about the camp and while the flesh was yet between their teeth ere it waschewed the wrath of the lord was kindled against the people and thelord smote the people with a very great plague and he called the name of that place kibrothhattaavah becausethere they buried the people that lusted and the people journeyed from kibrothhattaavah unto hazerothand abode at hazeroth and miriam and aaron spake against moses because of the ethiopianwoman whom he had married for he had married an ethiopian woman and they said hath the lord indeed spoken only by moses hath henot spoken also by us and the lord heard it now the man moses was very meek above all the men which wereupon the face of the earth   and the lord spake suddenly untomoses and unto aaron and unto miriam come out ye three unto thetabernacle of the congregation and they three came out and the lord came down in the pillar of the cloud and stood inthe door of the tabernacle and called aaron and miriam and they bothcame forth and he said hear now my words if there be a prophet among youi the lord will make myself known unto him in a vision and will speakunto him in a dream my servant moses is not so who is faithful in all mine house with him will i speak mouth to mouth even apparently and not indark speeches and the similitude of the lord shall he beholdwherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant moses and the anger of the lord was kindled against them and hedeparted and the cloud departed from off the tabernacle and beholdmiriam became leprous white as snow and aaron looked upon miriamand behold she was leprous and aaron said unto moses alas my lord i beseech thee laynot the sin upon us wherein we have done foolishly and wherein wehave sinned let her not be as one dead of whom the flesh is half consumedwhen he cometh out of his mothers womb and moses cried unto the lord saying heal her now o god ibeseech thee and the lord said unto moses if her father had but spit in herface should she not be ashamed seven days let her be shut out fromthe camp seven days and after that let her be received in again and miriam was shut out from the camp seven days and the peoplejourneyed not till miriam was brought in again and afterward the people removed from hazeroth and pitched inthe wilderness of paran and the lord spake unto moses saying  send thou men thatthey may search the land of canaan which i give unto the children ofisrael of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man every onea ruler among them and moses by the commandment of the lord sent them from thewilderness of paran all those men were heads of the children ofisrael and these were their names of the tribe of reuben shammua theson of zaccur of the tribe of simeon shaphat the son of hori of the tribe of judah caleb the son of jephunneh of the tribe of issachar igal the son of joseph of the tribe of ephraim oshea the son of nun of the tribe of benjamin palti the son of raphu of the tribe of zebulun gaddiel the son of sodi of the tribe of joseph namely of the tribe of manasseh gaddithe son of susi of the tribe of dan ammiel the son of gemalli of the tribe of asher sethur the son of michael of the tribe of naphtali nahbi the son of vophsi of the tribe of gad geuel the son of machi these are the names of the men which moses sent to spy out thelandand moses called oshea the son of nun jehoshua and moses sent them to spy out the land of canaan and said untothem get you up this way southward and go up into the mountain and see the land what it is and the people that dwelleththerein whether they be strong or weak few or many  and whatthe land is that they dwell in whether it be good or bad and whatcities they be that they dwell in whether in tents or in strongholds  and what the land is whether it be fat or lean whetherthere be wood therein or not and be ye of good courage and bring ofthe fruit of the land now the time was the time of the firstripegrapes so they went up and searched the land from the wilderness ofzin unto rehob as men come to hamath and they ascended by the south and came unto hebron whereahiman sheshai and talmai the children of anak were now hebronwas built seven years before zoan in egypt   and they came untothe brook of eshcol and cut down from thence a branch with onecluster of grapes and they bare it between two upon a staff and theybrought of the pomegranates and of the figs the place was called the brook eshcol because of the cluster ofgrapes which the children of israel cut down from thence and they returned from searching of the land after forty days and they went and came to moses and to aaron and to all thecongregation of the children of israel unto the wilderness of paranto kadesh and brought back word unto them and unto all thecongregation and shewed them the fruit of the land and they told him and said we came unto the land whither thousentest us and surely it floweth with milk and honey and this is thefruit of it nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land andthe cities are walled and very great and moreover we saw thechildren of anak there the amalekites dwell in the land of the south and the hittitesand the jebusites and the amorites dwell in the mountains and thecanaanites dwell by the sea and by the coast of jordan and caleb stilled the people before moses and said let us goup at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it but the men that went up with him said we be not able to go upagainst the people for they are stronger than we and they brought up an evil report of the land which they hadsearched unto the children of israel saying the land through whichwe have gone to search it is a land that eateth up the inhabitantsthereof and all the people that we saw in it are men of a greatstature and there we saw the giants the sons of anak which come of thegiants and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers and so we werein their sight and all the congregation lifted up their voice and cried andthe people wept that night and all the children of israel murmured against moses and againstaaron and the whole congregation said unto them would god that wehad died in the land of egypt or would god we had died in thiswilderness   and wherefore hath the lord brought us unto thisland to fall by the sword that our wives and our children should bea prey were it not better for us to return into egypt   and theysaid one to another let us make a captain and let us return intoegypt then moses and aaron fell on their faces before all the assemblyof the congregation of the children of israel and joshua the son of nun and caleb the son of jephunneh whichwere of them that searched the land rent their clothes  and theyspake unto all the company of the children of israel saying theland which we passed through to search it is an exceeding good land if the lord delight in us then he will bring us into this landand give it us a land which floweth with milk and honey only rebel not ye against the lord neither fear ye the people ofthe land for they are bread for us their defence is departed fromthem and the lord is with us fear them not but all the congregation bade stone them with stones and theglory of the lord appeared in the tabernacle of the congregationbefore all the children of israel and the lord said unto moses how long will this people provokeme  and how long will it be ere they believe me for all the signswhich i have shewed among them   i will smite them with thepestilence and disinherit them and will make of thee a greaternation and mightier than they and moses said unto the lord then the egyptians shall hear itfor thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them and they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land for theyhave heard that thou lord art among this people that thou lord artseen face to face and that thy cloud standeth over them and thatthou goest before them by day time in a pillar of a cloud and in apillar of fire by night now if thou shalt kill all this people as one man then thenations which have heard the fame of thee will speak saying because the lord was not able to bring this people into the land whichhe sware unto them therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness and now i beseech thee let the power of my lord be greataccording as thou hast spoken saying  the lord islongsuffering and of great mercy forgiving iniquity andtransgression and by no means clearing the guilty visiting theiniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourthgeneration pardon i beseech thee the iniquity of this people accordingunto the greatness of thy mercy and as thou hast forgiven thispeople from egypt even until now and the lord said i have pardoned according to thy word but as truly as i live all the earth shall be filled with the gloryof the lord because all those men which have seen my glory and my miracleswhich i did in egypt and in the wilderness and have tempted me nowthese ten times and have not hearkened to my voice  surely theyshall not see the land which i sware unto their fathers neither shallany of them that provoked me see it  but my servant calebbecause he had another spirit with him and hath followed me fullyhim will i bring into the land whereinto he went and his seed shallpossess it now the amalekites and the canaanites dwelt in the valleytomorrow turn you and get you into the wilderness by the way of thered sea and the lord spake unto moses and unto aaron saying  howlong shall i bear with this evil congregation which murmur againstme i have heard the murmurings of the children of israel which theymurmur against me say unto them as truly as i live saith the lord as ye havespoken in mine ears so will i do to you  your carcases shallfall in this wilderness and all that were numbered of you accordingto your whole number from twenty years old and upward which havemurmured against me doubtless ye shall not come into the land concerning which isware to make you dwell therein save caleb the son of jephunneh andjoshua the son of nun but your little ones which ye said should be a prey them willi bring in and they shall know the land which ye have despised but as for you your carcases they shall fall in thiswilderness and your children shall wander in the wilderness forty yearsand bear your whoredoms until your carcases be wasted in thewilderness after the number of the days in which ye searched the land evenforty days each day for a year shall ye bear your iniquities evenforty years and ye shall know my breach of promise i the lord have said i will surely do it unto all this evilcongregation that are gathered together against me in thiswilderness they shall be consumed and there they shall die and the men which moses sent to search the land who returnedand made all the congregation to murmur against him by bringing up aslander upon the land  even those men that did bring up the evilreport upon the land died by the plague before the lord but joshua the son of nun and caleb the son of jephunneh whichwere of the men that went to search the land lived still and moses told these sayings unto all the children of israeland the people mourned greatly and they rose up early in the morning and gat them up into thetop of the mountain saying lo we be here and will go up unto theplace which the lord hath promised for we have sinned and moses said wherefore now do ye transgress the commandmentof the lord but it shall not prosper go not up for the lord is not among you that ye be not smittenbefore your enemies for the amalekites and the canaanites are there before you andye shall fall by the sword because ye are turned away from the lordtherefore the lord will not be with you but they presumed to go up unto the hill top nevertheless theark of the covenant of the lord and moses departed not out of thecamp then the amalekites came down and the canaanites which dwelt inthat hill and smote them and discomfited them even unto hormah and the lord spake unto moses saying  speak unto thechildren of israel and say unto them when ye be come into the landof your habitations which i give unto you  and will make anoffering by fire unto the lord a burnt offering or a sacrifice inperforming a vow or in a freewill offering or in your solemn feaststo make a sweet savour unto the lord of the herd or of the flock then shall he that offereth his offering unto the lord bring ameat offering of a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part ofan hin of oil and the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering shaltthou prepare with the burnt offering or sacrifice for one lamb or for a ram thou shalt prepare for a meat offering two tenthdeals of flour mingled with the third part of an hin of oil and for a drink offering thou shalt offer the third part of anhin of wine for a sweet savour unto the lord and when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt offering or for asacrifice in performing a vow or peace offerings unto the lord then shall he bring with a bullock a meat offering of three tenthdeals of flour mingled with half an hin of oil and thou shalt bring for a drink offering half an hin of winefor an offering made by fire of a sweet savour unto the lord thus shall it be done for one bullock or for one ram or for alamb or a kid according to the number that ye shall prepare so shall ye do toevery one according to their number all that are born of the country shall do these things afterthis manner in offering an offering made by fire of a sweet savourunto the lord and if a stranger sojourn with you or whosoever be among you inyour generations and will offer an offering made by fire of a sweetsavour unto the lord as ye do so he shall do one ordinance shall be both for you of the congregation andalso for the stranger that sojourneth with you an ordinance for everin your generations as ye are so shall the stranger be before thelord one law and one manner shall be for you and for the strangerthat sojourneth with you and the lord spake unto moses saying  speak unto thechildren of israel and say unto them when ye come into the landwhither i bring you  then it shall be that when ye eat of thebread of the land ye shall offer up an heave offering unto the lord ye shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough for an heaveoffering as ye do the heave offering of the threshingfloor so shallye heave it of the first of your dough ye shall give unto the lord an heaveoffering in your generations and if ye have erred and not observed all these commandmentswhich the lord hath spoken unto moses  even all that the lordhath commanded you by the hand of moses from the day that the lordcommanded moses and henceforward among your generations  thenit shall be if ought be committed by ignorance without the knowledgeof the congregation that all the congregation shall offer one youngbullock for a burnt offering for a sweet savour unto the lord withhis meat offering and his drink offering according to the mannerand one kid of the goats for a sin offering and the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregationof the children of israel and it shall be forgiven them for it isignorance and they shall bring their offering a sacrifice made byfire unto the lord and their sin offering before the lord for theirignorance  and it shall be forgiven all the congregation of thechildren of israel and the stranger that sojourneth among themseeing all the people were in ignorance and if any soul sin through ignorance then he shall bring a shegoat of the first year for a sin offering and the priest shall make an atonement for the soul that sinnethignorantly when he sinneth by ignorance before the lord to make anatonement for him and it shall be forgiven him ye shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignoranceboth for him that is born among the children of israel and for thestranger that sojourneth among them but the soul that doeth ought presumptuously whether he be bornin the land or a stranger the same reproacheth the lord and thatsoul shall be cut off from among his people because he hath despised the word of the lord and hath brokenhis commandment that soul shall utterly be cut off his iniquityshall be upon him and while the children of israel were in the wilderness theyfound a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day and they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto mosesand aaron and unto all the congregation and they put him in ward because it was not declared whatshould be done to him and the lord said unto moses the man shall be surely put todeath all the congregation shall stone him with stones without thecamp and all the congregation brought him without the camp andstoned him with stones and he died as the lord commanded moses and the lord spake unto moses saying  speak unto thechildren of israel and bid them that they make them fringes in theborders of their garments throughout their generations and that theyput upon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blue  and itshall be unto you for a fringe that ye may look upon it and rememberall the commandments of the lord and do them and that ye seek notafter your own heart and your own eyes after which ye use to go awhoring  that ye may remember and do all my commandments andbe holy unto your god i am the lord your god which brought you out of the land ofegypt to be your god i am the lord your god now korah the son of izhar the son of kohath the son of leviand dathan and abiram the sons of eliab and on the son of pelethsons of reuben took men  and they rose up before moses withcertain of the children of israel two hundred and fifty princes ofthe assembly famous in the congregation men of renown  and theygathered themselves together against moses and against aaron and saidunto them ye take too much upon you seeing all the congregation areholy every one of them and the lord is among them wherefore thenlift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the lord   andwhen moses heard it he fell upon his face  and he spake untokorah and unto all his company saying even to morrow the lord willshew who are his and who is holy and will cause him to come nearunto him even him whom he hath chosen will he cause to come near untohim this do take you censers korah and all his company  andput fire therein and put incense in them before the lord to morrowand it shall be that the man whom the lord doth choose he shall beholy ye take too much upon you ye sons of levi and moses said unto korah hear i pray you ye sons of levi seemeth it but a small thing unto you that the god of israelhath separated you from the congregation of israel to bring you nearto himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the lord and tostand before the congregation to minister unto them   and hehath brought thee near to him and all thy brethren the sons of leviwith thee and seek ye the priesthood also   for which causeboth thou and all thy company are gathered together against the lordand what is aaron that ye murmur against him   and moses sentto call dathan and abiram the sons of eliab which said we will notcome up  is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out ofa land that floweth with milk and honey to kill us in the wildernessexcept thou make thyself altogether a prince over us   moreoverthou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and honeyor given us inheritance of fields and vineyards wilt thou put out theeyes of these men we will not come up and moses was very wroth and said unto the lord respect notthou their offering i have not taken one ass from them neither havei hurt one of them and moses said unto korah be thou and all thy company beforethe lord thou and they and aaron to morrow  and take everyman his censer and put incense in them and bring ye before the lordevery man his censer two hundred and fifty censers thou also andaaron each of you his censer and they took every man his censer and put fire in them andlaid incense thereon and stood in the door of the tabernacle of thecongregation with moses and aaron and korah gathered all the congregation against them unto thedoor of the tabernacle of the congregation and the glory of the lordappeared unto all the congregation and the lord spake unto moses and unto aaron saying separate yourselves from among this congregation that i may consumethem in a moment and they fell upon their faces and said o god the god of thespirits of all flesh shall one man sin and wilt thou be wroth withall the congregation   and the lord spake unto moses saying speak unto the congregation saying get you up from about thetabernacle of korah dathan and abiram and moses rose up and went unto dathan and abiram and theelders of israel followed him and he spake unto the congregation saying depart i pray youfrom the tents of these wicked men and touch nothing of theirs lestye be consumed in all their sins so they gat up from the tabernacle of korah dathan and abiramon every side and dathan and abiram came out and stood in the doorof their tents and their wives and their sons and their littlechildren and moses said hereby ye shall know that the lord hath sent meto do all these works for i have not done them of mine own mind if these men die the common death of all men or if they bevisited after the visitation of all men then the lord hath not sentme but if the lord make a new thing and the earth open her mouthand swallow them up with all that appertain unto them and they godown quick into the pit then ye shall understand that these men haveprovoked the lord and it came to pass as he had made an end of speaking all thesewords that the ground clave asunder that was under them  andthe earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up and their housesand all the men that appertained unto korah and all their goods they and all that appertained to them went down alive into thepit and the earth closed upon them and they perished from among thecongregation and all israel that were round about them fled at the cry ofthem for they said lest the earth swallow us up also and there came out a fire from the lord and consumed the twohundred and fifty men that offered incense and the lord spake unto moses saying  speak unto eleazarthe son of aaron the priest that he take up the censers out of theburning and scatter thou the fire yonder for they are hallowed the censers of these sinners against their own souls let themmake them broad plates for a covering of the altar for they offeredthem before the lord therefore they are hallowed and they shall be asign unto the children of israel and eleazar the priest took the brasen censers wherewith theythat were burnt had offered and they were made broad plates for acovering of the altar  to be a memorial unto the children ofisrael that no stranger which is not of the seed of aaron come nearto offer incense before the lord that he be not as korah and as hiscompany as the lord said to him by the hand of moses but on the morrow all the congregation of the children of israelmurmured against moses and against aaron saying ye have killed thepeople of the lord and it came to pass when the congregation was gathered againstmoses and against aaron that they looked toward the tabernacle of thecongregation and behold the cloud covered it and the glory of thelord appeared and moses and aaron came before the tabernacle of thecongregation and the lord spake unto moses saying  get you up fromamong this congregation that i may consume them as in a moment andthey fell upon their faces and moses said unto aaron take a censer and put fire thereinfrom off the altar and put on incense and go quickly unto thecongregation and make an atonement for them for there is wrath goneout from the lord the plague is begun and aaron took as moses commanded and ran into the midst of thecongregation and behold the plague was begun among the people andhe put on incense and made an atonement for the people and he stood between the dead and the living and the plague wasstayed now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand andseven hundred beside them that died about the matter of korah and aaron returned unto moses unto the door of the tabernacle ofthe congregation and the plague was stayed and the lord spake unto moses saying  speak unto thechildren of israel and take of every one of them a rod according tothe house of their fathers of all their princes according to thehouse of their fathers twelve rods write thou every mans name uponhis rod and thou shalt write aarons name upon the rod of levi for onerod shall be for the head of the house of their fathers and thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregationbefore the testimony where i will meet with you and it shall come to pass that the mans rod whom i shallchoose shall blossom and i will make to cease from me the murmuringsof the children of israel whereby they murmur against you and moses spake unto the children of israel and every one oftheir princes gave him a rod apiece for each prince one according totheir fathers houses even twelve rods and the rod of aaron wasamong their rods and moses laid up the rods before the lord in the tabernacle ofwitness and it came to pass that on the morrow moses went into thetabernacle of witness and behold the rod of aaron for the house oflevi was budded and brought forth buds and bloomed blossoms andyielded almonds and moses brought out all the rods from before the lord unto allthe children of israel and they looked and took every man his rod and the lord said unto moses bring aarons rod again before thetestimony to be kept for a token against the rebels and thou shaltquite take away their murmurings from me that they die not and moses did so as the lord commanded him so did he and the children of israel spake unto moses saying behold wedie we perish we all perish whosoever cometh any thing near unto the tabernacle of the lordshall die shall we be consumed with dying   and the lord saidunto aaron thou and thy sons and thy fathers house with thee shallbear the iniquity of the sanctuary and thou and thy sons with theeshall bear the iniquity of your priesthood and thy brethren also of the tribe of levi the tribe of thyfather bring thou with thee that they may be joined unto thee andminister unto thee but thou and thy sons with thee shall ministerbefore the tabernacle of witness and they shall keep thy charge and the charge of all thetabernacle only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the sanctuaryand the altar that neither they nor ye also die and they shall be joined unto thee and keep the charge of thetabernacle of the congregation for all the service of the tabernacleand a stranger shall not come nigh unto you and ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary and the charge ofthe altar that there be no wrath any more upon the children ofisrael and i behold i have taken your brethren the levites from amongthe children of israel to you they are given as a gift for the lordto do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation therefore thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priestsoffice for everything of the altar and within the vail and ye shallserve i have given your priests office unto you as a service ofgift and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death and the lord spake unto aaron behold i also have given thee thecharge of mine heave offerings of all the hallowed things of

any part among them i am thy partand thine inheritance among the children of israel and behold i have given the children of levi all the tenth inisrael for an inheritance for their service which they serve eventhe service of the tabernacle of the congregation neither must the children of israel henceforth come nigh thetabernacle of the congregation lest they bear sin and die but the levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of thecongregation and they shall bear their iniquity it shall be astatute for ever throughout your generations that among the childrenof israel they have no inheritance but the tithes of the children of israel which they offer as anheave offering unto the lord i have given to the levites to inherittherefore i have said unto them among the children of

shall be unclean until even and whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean andthe soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until even then came the children of israel even the whole congregationinto the desert of zin in the first month and the people abode inkadesh and miriam died there and was buried there and there was no water for the congregation and they gatheredthemselves together against moses and against aaron and the people chode with moses and spake saying would godthat we had died when our brethren died before the lord   and whyhave ye brought up the congregation of the lord into this wildernessthat we and our cattle should die there   and wherefore have yemade us to come up out of egypt to bring us in unto this evil placeit is no place of seed or of figs or of vines or of pomegranatesneither is there any water to drink and moses and aaron went from the presence of the assembly untothe door of the tabernacle of the congregation and they fell upontheir faces and the glory of the lord appeared unto them and the lord spake unto moses saying  take the rod andgather thou the assembly together thou and aaron thy brother andspeak ye unto the rock before their eyes and it shall give forth hiswater and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock sothou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink and moses took the rod from before the lord as he commanded him and moses and aaron gathered the congregation together beforethe rock and he said unto them hear now ye rebels must we fetchyou water out of this rock   and moses lifted up his hand andwith his rod he smote the rock twice and the water came outabundantly and the congregation drank and their beasts also and the lord spake unto moses and aaron because ye believed menot to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of israel thereforeye shall not bring this congregation into the land which i have giventhem this is the water of meribah because the children of israelstrove with the lord and he was sanctified in them and moses sent messengers from kadesh unto the king of edomthus saith thy brother israel thou knowest all the travail that hathbefallen us  how our fathers went down into egypt and we havedwelt in egypt a long time and the egyptians vexed us and ourfathers  and when we cried unto the lord he heard our voiceand sent an angel and hath brought us forth out of egypt andbehold we are in kadesh a city in the uttermost of thy border let us pass i pray thee through thy country we will not passthrough the fields or through the vineyards neither will we drink ofthe water of the wells we will go by the kings high way we will notturn to the right hand nor to the left until we have passed thyborders and edom said unto him thou shalt not pass by me lest i comeout against thee with the sword and the children of israel said unto him we will go by the highway and if i and my cattle drink of thy water then i will pay forit i will only without doing anything else go through on my feet and he said thou shalt not go through and edom came outagainst him with much people and with a strong hand thus edom refused to give israel passage through his borderwherefore israel turned away from him and the children of israel even the whole congregationjourneyed from kadesh and came unto mount hor and the lord spake unto moses and aaron in mount hor by thecoast of the land of edom saying  aaron shall be gathered untohis people for he shall not enter into the land which i have givenunto the children of israel because ye rebelled against my word atthe water of meribah take aaron and eleazar his son and bring them up unto mounthor  and strip aaron of his garments and put them upon eleazarhis son and aaron shall be gathered unto his people and shall diethere and moses did as the lord commanded and they went up into mounthor in the sight of all the congregation and moses stripped aaron of his garments and put them uponeleazar his son and aaron died there in the top of the mount andmoses and eleazar came down from the mount and when all the congregation saw that aaron was dead theymourned for aaron thirty days even all the house of israel and when king arad the canaanite which dwelt in the south heardtell that israel came by the way of the spies then he fought againstisrael and took some of them prisoners and israel vowed a vow unto the lord and said if thou wiltindeed deliver this people into my hand then i will utterly destroytheir cities and the lord hearkened to the voice of israel and delivered upthe canaanites and they utterly destroyed them and their cities andhe called the name of the place hormah and they journeyed from mount hor by the way of the red sea tocompass the land of edom and the soul of the people was muchdiscouraged because of the way and the people spake against god and against moses whereforehave ye brought us up out of egypt to die in the wilderness for thereis no bread neither is there any water and our soul loatheth thislight bread and the lord sent fiery serpents among the people and they bitthe people and much people of israel died therefore the people came to moses and said we have sinned forwe have spoken against the lord and against thee pray unto the lordthat he take away the serpents from us and moses prayed for thepeople and the lord said unto moses make thee a fiery serpent and setit upon a pole and it shall come to pass that every one that isbitten when he looketh upon it shall live and moses made a serpent of brass and put it upon a pole and itcame to pass that if a serpent had bitten any man when he beheld theserpent of brass he lived and the children of israel set forward and pitched in oboth and they journeyed from oboth and pitched at ijeabarim in thewilderness which is before moab toward the sunrising from thence they removed and pitched in the valley of zared from thence they removed and pitched on the other side ofarnon which is in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of theamorites for arnon is the border of moab between moab and theamorites wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the lord whathe did in the red sea and in the brooks of arnon  and at thestream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of ar and liethupon the border of moab and from thence they went to beer that is the well whereof thelord spake unto moses gather the people together and i will givethem water then israel sang this song spring up o well sing ye unto it the princes digged the well the nobles of the people digged itby the direction of the lawgiver with their staves and from thewilderness they went to mattanah  and from mattanah to nahalieland from nahaliel to bamoth  and from bamoth in the valley thatis in the country of moab to the top of pisgah which looketh towardjeshimon and israel sent messengers unto sihon king of the amoritessaying  let me pass through thy land we will not turn into thefields or into the vineyards we will not drink of the waters of thewell but we will go along by the kings high way until we be pastthy borders and sihon would not suffer israel to pass through his borderbut sihon gathered all his people together and went out againstisrael into the wilderness and he came to jahaz and fought againstisrael and israel smote him with the edge of the sword and possessedhis land from arnon unto jabbok even unto the children of ammon forthe border of the children of ammon was strong and israel took all these cities and israel dwelt in all thecities of the amorites in heshbon and in all the villages thereof for heshbon was the city of sihon the king of the amorites whohad fought against the former king of moab and taken all his land outof his hand even unto arnon wherefore they that speak in proverbs say come into heshbonlet the city of sihon be built and prepared  for there is a firegone out of heshbon a flame from the city of sihon it hath consumedar of moab and the lords of the high places of arnon woe to thee moab thou art undone o people of chemosh he hathgiven his sons that escaped and his daughters into captivity untosihon king of the amorites we have shot at them heshbon is perished even unto dibon andwe have laid them waste even unto nophah which reacheth unto medeba thus israel dwelt in the land of the amorites and moses sent to spy out jaazer and they took the villagesthereof and drove out the amorites that were there and they turned and went up by the way of bashan and og theking of bashan went out against them he and all his people to thebattle at edrei and the lord said unto moses fear him not for i have deliveredhim into thy hand and all his people and his land and thou shalt doto him as thou didst unto sihon king of the amorites which dwelt atheshbon so they smote him and his sons and all his people until therewas none left him alive and they possessed his land and the children of israel set forward and pitched in the plainsof moab on this side jordan by jericho and balak the son of zippor saw all that israel had done to theamorites and moab was sore afraid of the people because they were manyand moab was distressed because of the children of israel and moab said unto the elders of midian now shall this companylick up all that are round about us as the ox licketh up the grass ofthe fieldand balak the son of zippor was king of the moabites at that time he sent messengers therefore unto balaam the son of beor topethor which is by the river of the land of the children of hispeople to call him saying behold there is a people come out fromegypt behold they cover the face of the earth and they abide overagainst me  come now therefore i pray thee curse me thispeople for they are too mighty for me peradventure i shall prevailthat we may smite them and that i may drive them out of the land fori wot that he whom thou blessest is blessed and he whom thou cursestis cursed and the elders of moab and the elders of midian departed with therewards of divination in their hand and they came unto balaam andspake unto him the words of balak and he said unto them lodge here this night and i will bringyou word again as the lord shall speak unto me and the princes ofmoab abode with balaam and god came unto balaam and said what men are these with thee and balaam said unto god balak the son of zippor king of moabhath sent unto me saying  behold there is a people come out ofegypt which covereth the face of the earth come now curse me themperadventure i shall be able to overcome them and drive them out and god said unto balaam thou shalt not go with them thoushalt not curse the people for they are blessed and balaam rose up in the morning and said unto the princes ofbalak get you into your land for the lord refuseth to give me leaveto go with you and the princes of moab rose up and they went unto balak andsaid balaam refuseth to come with us and balak sent yet again princes more and more honourable thanthey and they came to balaam and said to him thus saith balak theson of zippor let nothing i pray thee hinder thee from coming untome  for i will promote thee unto very great honour and i willdo whatsoever thou sayest unto me come therefore i pray thee curseme this people and balaam answered and said unto the servants of balak ifbalak would give me his house full of silver and gold i cannot gobeyond the word of the lord my god to do less or more now therefore i pray you tarry ye also here this night that imay know what the lord will say unto me more and god came unto balaam at night and said unto him if the mencome to call thee rise up and go with them but yet the word which ishall say unto thee that shalt thou do and balaam rose up in the morning and saddled his ass and wentwith the princes of moab and gods anger was kindled because he went and the angel ofthe lord stood in the way for an adversary against him now he wasriding upon his ass and his two servants were with him and the ass saw the angel of the lord standing in the way andhis sword drawn in his hand and the ass turned aside out of the wayand went into the field and balaam smote the ass to turn her intothe way but the angel of the lord stood in a path of the vineyards awall being on this side and a wall on that side and when the ass saw the angel of the lord she thrust herselfunto the wall and crushed balaams foot against the wall and hesmote her again and the angel of the lord went further and stood in a narrowplace where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to theleft and when the ass saw the angel of the lord she fell down underbalaam and balaams anger was kindled and he smote the ass with astaff and the lord opened the mouth of the ass and she said untobalaam what have i done unto thee that thou hast smitten me thesethree times   and balaam said unto the ass because thou hastmocked me i would there were a sword in mine hand for now would ikill thee and the ass said unto balaam am not i thine ass upon whichthou hast ridden ever since i was thine unto this day was i ever wontto do so unto thee and he said nay then the lord opened the eyes of balaam and he saw the angel ofthe lord standing in the way and his sword drawn in his hand and hebowed down his head and fell flat on his face and the angel of the lord said unto him wherefore hast thousmitten thine ass these three times behold i went out to withstandthee because thy way is perverse before me  and the ass saw meand turned from me these three times unless she had turned from mesurely now also i had slain thee and saved her alive and balaam said unto the angel of the lord i have sinned for iknew not that thou stoodest in the way against me now therefore ifit displease thee i will get me back again and the angel of the lord said unto balaam go with the men butonly the word that i shall speak unto thee that thou shalt speak sobalaam went with the princes of balak and when balak heard that balaam was come he went out to meethim unto a city of moab which is in the border of arnon which is inthe utmost coast and balak said unto balaam did i not earnestly send unto theeto call thee wherefore camest thou not unto me am i not able indeedto promote thee to honour   and balaam said unto balak lo i amcome unto thee have i now any power at all to say any thing the wordthat god putteth in my mouth that shall i speak and balaam went with balak and they came unto kirjathhuzoth and balak offered oxen and sheep and sent to balaam and to theprinces that were with him and it came to pass on the morrow that balak took balaam andbrought him up into the high places of baal that thence he might seethe utmost part of the people and balaam said unto balak build me here seven altars andprepare me here seven oxen and seven rams and balak did as balaam had spoken and balak and balaam offeredon every altar a bullock and a ram and balaam said unto balak stand by thy burnt offering and iwill go peradventure the lord will come to meet me and whatsoever hesheweth me i will tell thee and he went to an high place and god met balaam and he said unto him i have prepared sevenaltars and i have offered upon every altar a bullock and a ram and the lord put a word in balaams mouth and said return untobalak and thus thou shalt speak and he returned unto him and lo he stood by his burntsacrifice he and all the princes of moab and he took up his parable and said balak the king of moab hathbrought me from aram out of the mountains of the east saying comecurse me jacob and come defy israel how shall i curse whom god hath not cursed or how shall i defywhom the lord hath not defied   for from the top of the rocks isee him and from the hills i behold him lo the people shall dwellalone and shall not be reckoned among the nations who can count the dust of jacob and the number of the fourthpart of israel let me die the death of the righteous and let my lastend be like his   and balak said unto balaam what hast thoudone unto me i took thee to curse mine enemies and behold thouhast blessed them altogether and he answered and said must i not take heed to speak thatwhich the lord hath put in my mouth   and balak said unto himcome i pray thee with me unto another place from whence thou mayestsee them thou shalt see but the utmost part of them and shalt notsee them all and curse me them from thence and he brought him into the field of zophim to the top ofpisgah and built seven altars and offered a bullock and a ram onevery altar and he said unto balak stand here by thy burnt offering whilei meet the lord yonder and the lord met balaam and put a word in his mouth and saidgo again unto balak and say thus and when he came to him behold he stood by his burnt offeringand the princes of moab with him and balak said unto him what haththe lord spoken   and he took up his parable and said rise upbalak and hear hearken unto me thou son of zippor  god is nota man that he should lie neither the son of man that he shouldrepent hath he said and shall he not do it or hath he spoken andshall he not make it good   behold i have received commandmentto bless and he hath blessed and i cannot reverse it he hath not beheld iniquity in jacob neither hath he seenperverseness in israel the lord his god is with him and the shout ofa king is among them god brought them out of egypt he hath as it were the strengthof an unicorn surely there is no enchantment against jacob neither is thereany divination against israel according to this time it shall be saidof jacob and of israel what hath god wrought   behold thepeople shall rise up as a great lion and lift up himself as a younglion he shall not lie down until he eat of the prey and drink theblood of the slain and balak said unto balaam neither curse them at all nor blessthem at all but balaam answered and said unto balak told not i theesaying all that the lord speaketh that i must do   and balaksaid unto balaam come i pray thee i will bring thee unto anotherplace peradventure it will please god that thou mayest curse me themfrom thence and balak brought balaam unto the top of peor that lookethtoward jeshimon and balaam said unto balak build me here seven altars andprepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams and balak did as balaam had said and offered a bullock and aram on every altar and when balaam saw that it pleased the lord to bless israel hewent not as at other times to seek for enchantments but he set hisface toward the wilderness and balaam lifted up his eyes and he saw israel abiding in histents according to their tribes and the spirit of god came upon him and he took up his parable and said balaam the son of beor hathsaid and the man whose eyes are open hath said  he hath saidwhich heard the words of god which saw the vision of the almightyfalling into a trance but having his eyes open  how goodly arethy tents o jacob and thy tabernacles o israel   as thevalleys are they spread forth as gardens by the rivers side as thetrees of lign aloes which the lord hath planted and as cedar treesbeside the waters he shall pour the water out of his buckets and his seed shall bein many waters and his king shall be higher than agag and hiskingdom shall be exalted god brought him forth out of egypt he hath as it were thestrength of an unicorn he shall eat up the nations his enemies andshall break their bones and pierce them through with his arrows he couched he lay down as a lion and as a great lion who shallstir him up blessed is he that blesseth thee and cursed is he thatcurseth thee and balaks anger was kindled against balaam and he smote hishands together and balak said unto balaam i called thee to cursemine enemies and behold thou hast altogether blessed them thesethree times therefore now flee thou to thy place i thought to promote theeunto great honour but lo the lord hath kept thee back from honour and balaam said unto balak spake i not also to thy messengerswhich thou sentest unto me saying  if balak would give me hishouse full of silver and gold i cannot go beyond the commandment ofthe lord to do either good or bad of mine own mind but what the lordsaith that will i speak   and now behold i go unto my peoplecome therefore and i will advertise thee what this people shall do tothy people in the latter days and he took up his parable and said balaam the son of beorhath said and the man whose eyes are open hath said  he hathsaid which heard the words of god and knew the knowledge of the mosthigh which saw the vision of the almighty falling into a trance buthaving his eyes open  i shall see him but not now i shallbehold him but not nigh there shall come a star out of jacob and asceptre shall rise out of israel and shall smite the corners of moaband destroy all the children of sheth and edom shall be a possession seir also shall be a possessionfor his enemies and israel shall do valiantly out of jacob shall come he that shall have dominion and shalldestroy him that remaineth of the city and when he looked on amalek he took up his parable and saidamalek was the first of the nations but his latter end shall be thathe perish for ever and he looked on the kenites and took up his parable and saidstrong is thy dwellingplace and thou puttest thy nest in a rock nevertheless the kenite shall be wasted until asshur shallcarry thee away captive and he took up his parable and said alas who shall live whengod doeth this   and ships shall come from the coast of chittimand shall afflict asshur and shall afflict eber and he also shallperish for ever and balaam rose up and went and returned to his place andbalak also went his way and israel abode in shittim and the people began to commitwhoredom with the daughters of moab and they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods andthe people did eat and bowed down to their gods and israel joined himself unto baalpeor and the anger of thelord was kindled against israel and the lord said unto moses take all the heads of the peopleand hang them up before the lord against the sun that the fierceanger of the lord may be turned away from israel and moses said unto the judges of israel slay ye every one hismen that were joined unto baalpeor and behold one of the children of israel came and brought untohis brethren a midianitish woman in the sight of moses and in thesight of all the congregation of the children of israel who wereweeping before the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and when phinehas the son of eleazar the son of aaron thepriest saw it he rose up from among the congregation and took ajavelin in his hand  and he went after the man of israel into thetent and thrust both of them through the man of israel and thewoman through her belly so the plague was stayed from the children ofisrael and those that died in the plague were twenty and four thousand and the lord spake unto moses saying  phinehas the sonof eleazar the son of aaron the priest hath turned my wrath awayfrom the children of israel while he was zealous for my sake amongthem that i consumed not the children of israel in my jealousy wherefore say behold i give unto him my covenant of peace and he shall have it and his seed after him even the covenantof an everlasting priesthood because he was zealous for his god andmade an atonement for the children of israel now the name of the israelite that was slain even that wasslain with the midianitish woman was zimri the son of salu a princeof a chief house among the simeonites and the name of the midianitish woman that was slain was cozbithe daughter of zur he was head over a people and of a chief housein midian and the lord spake unto moses saying  vex the midianitesand smite them  for they vex you with their wiles wherewiththey have beguiled you in the matter of peor and in the matter ofcozbi the daughter of a prince of midian their sister which wasslain in the day of the plague for peors sake and it came to pass after the plague

the war and let them go against the midianites and avenge thelord of midian of every tribe a thousand throughout all the tribes of israelshall ye send to the war so there were delivered out of the thousands of israel athousand of every tribe twelve thousand armed for war and moses sent them to the war a thousand of every tribe themand phinehas the son of eleazar the priest to the war with the holyinstruments and the trumpets to blow in his hand and they warred against the midianites as the lord commandedmoses and they slew all the males and they slew the kings of midian beside the rest of them thatwere slain namely evi and rekem and zur and hur and reba fivekings of midian balaam also the son of beor they slew with the sword and the children of israel took all the women of midian captivesand their little ones and took the spoil of all their cattle and alltheir flocks and all their goods and they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt and alltheir goodly castles with fire and they took all the spoil and all the prey both of men andof beasts and they brought the captives and the prey and the spoil untomoses and eleazar the priest and unto the congregation of thechildren of israel unto the camp at the plains of moab which are byjordan near jericho and moses and eleazar the priest and all the princes of thecongregation went forth to meet them without the camp and moses was wroth with the officers of the host with thecaptains over thousands and captains over hundreds which came fromthe battle and moses said unto them have ye saved all the women alive behold these caused the children of israel through the counselof balaam to commit trespass against the lord in the matter of peorand there was a plague among the congregation of the lord now therefore kill every male among the little ones and killevery woman that hath known man by lying with him but all the women children that have not known a man by lyingwith him keep alive for yourselves and do ye abide without the camp seven days whosoever hathkilled any person and whosoever hath touched any slain purify bothyourselves and your captives on the third day and on the seventh day and purify all your raiment and all that is made of skins andall work of goats hair and all things made of wood and eleazar the priest said unto the men of war which went tothe battle this is the ordinance of the law which the lord commandedmoses  only the gold and the silver the brass the iron thetin and the lead  every thing that may abide the fire ye shallmake it go through the fire and it shall be clean nevertheless itshall be purified with the water of separation and all that abidethnot the fire ye shall make go through the water and ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day and ye shallbe clean and afterward ye shall come into the camp and the lord spake unto moses saying  take the sum of theprey that was taken both of man and of beast thou and eleazar thepriest and the chief fathers of the congregation  and dividethe prey into two parts between them that took the war upon them whowent out to battle and between all the congregation  and levy atribute unto the lord of the men of war which went out to battle onesoul of five hundred both of the persons and of the beeves and ofthe asses and of the sheep  take it of their half and give itunto eleazar the priest for an heave offering of the lord and of the children of israels half thou shalt take oneportion of fifty of the persons of the beeves of the asses and ofthe flocks of all manner of beasts and give them unto the leviteswhich keep the charge of the tabernacle of the lord and moses and eleazar the priest did as the lord commandedmoses and the booty being the rest of the prey which the men of warhad caught was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and fivethousand sheep  and threescore and twelve thousand beeves and threescore and one thousand asses  and thirty and twothousand persons in all of women that had not known man by lying withhim and the half which was the portion of them that went out towar was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirtythousand and five hundred sheep  and the lords tribute of thesheep was six hundred and threescore and fifteen and the beeves were thirty and six thousand of which the lordstribute was threescore and twelve and the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred of whichthe lords tribute was threescore and one and the persons were sixteen thousand of which the lordstribute was thirty and two persons and moses gave the tribute which was the lords heave offeringunto eleazar the priest as the lord commanded moses and of the children of israels half which moses divided fromthe men that warred  now the half that pertained unto thecongregation was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seventhousand and five hundred sheep  and thirty and six thousandbeeves  and thirty thousand asses and five hundred  andsixteen thousand persons  even of the children of israelshalf moses took one portion of fifty both of man and of beast andgave them unto the levites which kept the charge of the tabernacle ofthe lord as the lord commanded moses and the officers which were over thousands of the host thecaptains of thousands and captains of hundreds came near unto moses and they said unto moses thy servants have taken the sum of themen of war which are under our charge and there lacketh not one manof us we have therefore brought an oblation for the lord what everyman hath gotten of jewels of gold chains and bracelets ringsearrings and tablets to make an atonement for our souls before thelord and moses and eleazar the priest took the gold of them even allwrought jewels and all the gold of the offering that they offered up to thelord of the captains of thousands and of the captains of hundredswas sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels for the men of war had taken spoil every man for himself and moses and eleazar the priest took the gold of the captainsof thousands and of hundreds and brought it into the tabernacle ofthe congregation for a memorial for the children of israel before thelord now the children of reuben and the children of gad had a verygreat multitude of cattle and when they saw the land of jazer andthe land of gilead that behold the place was a place for cattle the children of gad and the children of reuben came and spakeunto moses and to eleazar the priest and unto the princes of thecongregation saying  ataroth and dibon and jazer and nimrahand heshbon and elealeh and shebam and nebo and beon  eventhe country which the lord smote before the congregation of israel isa land for cattle and thy servants have cattle  wherefore saidthey if we have found grace in thy sight let this land be given untothy servants for a possession and bring us not over jordan and moses said unto the children of gad and to the children ofreuben shall your brethren go to war and shall ye sit here  and wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of israel fromgoing over into the land which the lord hath given them   thusdid your fathers when i sent them from kadeshbarnea to see the land for when they went up unto the valley of eshcol and saw theland they discouraged the heart of the children of israel that theyshould not go into the land which the lord had given them and the lords anger was kindled the same time and he swaresaying  surely none of the men that came up out of egypt fromtwenty years old and upward shall see the land which i sware untoabraham unto isaac and unto jacob because they have not whollyfollowed me  save caleb the son of jephunneh the kenezite andjoshua the son of nun for they have wholly followed the lord and the lords anger was kindled against israel and he madethem wander in the wilderness forty years until all the generationthat had done evil in the sight of the lord was consumed and behold ye are risen up in your fathers stead an increaseof sinful men to augment yet the fierce anger of the lord towardisrael for if ye turn away from after him he will yet again leave themin the wilderness and ye shall destroy all this people and they came near unto him and said we will build sheepfoldshere for our cattle and cities for our little ones  but weourselves will go ready armed before the children of israel until wehave brought them unto their place and our little ones shall dwell inthe fenced cities because of the inhabitants of the land we will not return unto our houses until the children of israelhave inherited every man his inheritance for we will not inherit with them on yonder side jordan orforward because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side jordaneastward and moses said unto them if ye will do this thing if ye willgo armed before the lord to war  and will go all of you armedover jordan before the lord until he hath driven out his enemies frombefore him  and the land be subdued before the lord thenafterward ye shall return and be guiltless before the lord andbefore israel and this land shall be your possession before the lord but if ye will not do so behold ye have sinned against thelord and be sure your sin will find you out build you cities for your little ones and folds for your sheepand do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth and the children of gad and the children of reuben spake untomoses saying thy servants will do as my lord commandeth our little ones our wives our flocks and all our cattleshall be there in the cities of gilead  but thy servants willpass over every man armed for war before the lord to battle as mylord saith so concerning them moses commanded eleazar the priest andjoshua the son of nun and the chief fathers of the tribes of thechildren of israel  and moses said unto them if the children ofgad and the children of reuben will pass with you over jordan everyman armed to battle before the lord and the land shall be subduedbefore you then ye shall give them the land of gilead for apossession  but if they will not pass over with you armed theyshall have possessions among you in the land of canaan and the children of gad and the children of reuben answeredsaying as the lord hath said unto thy servants so will we do we will pass over armed before the lord into the land of canaanthat the possession of our inheritance on this side jordan may beours and moses gave unto them even to the children of gad and tothe children of reuben and unto half the tribe of manasseh the son ofjoseph the kingdom of sihon king of the amorites and the kingdom

three citiesshall ye give in the land of canaan which shall be cities of refuge these six cities shall be a refuge both for the children ofisrael and for the stranger and for the sojourner among them thatevery one that killeth any person unawares may flee thither and if he smite him with an instrument of iron so that he diehe is a murderer the murderer shall surely be put to death and if he smite him with throwing a stone wherewith he may dieand he die he is a murderer the murderer shall surely be put todeath or if he smite him with an hand weapon of wood wherewith he maydie and he die he is a murderer the murderer shall surely be put todeath the revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer when hemeeteth him he shall slay him but if he thrust him of hatred or hurl at him by laying ofwait that he die  or in enmity smite him with his hand that hedie he that smote him shall surely be put to death for he is amurderer the revenger of blood shall slay the murderer when hemeeteth him but if he thrust him suddenly without enmity or have cast uponhim any thing without laying of wait  or with any stonewherewith a man may die seeing him not and cast it upon him that hedie and was not his enemy neither sought his harm  then thecongregation shall judge between the slayer and the revenger of bloodaccording to these judgments  and the congregation shall deliverthe slayer out of the

therevenger of blood kill the slayer he shall not be guilty of blood because he should have remained in the city of his refuge untilthe death of the high priest but after the death of the high priestthe slayer shall return into the land of his possession so these things shall be for a statute of judgment unto youthroughout your generations in all your dwellings whoso killeth any person the murderer shall be put to death bythe mouth of witnesses but one witness shall not testify against anyperson to cause him to die moreover ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of amurderer which is guilty of death but he shall be surely put todeath and ye shall take no satisfaction for him that is fled to thecity of his refuge that he should come again to dwell in the landuntil the death of

so shall it be taken from the lotof our inheritance and when the jubile of the children of israel shall be thenshall their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the tribewhereunto they are received so shall their inheritance be taken awayfrom the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers and moses commanded the children of israel according to the wordof the lord saying the tribe of the

 and they were married into the families of thesons of manasseh the son of joseph and their inheritance remained inthe tribe of the family of their father these are the commandments and the judgments which the lordcommanded by the hand of moses unto the children of israel in theplains of moab by jordan near jerichothe fifth book of moses  called deuteronomy these be the words which moses spake unto all israel on this sidejordan in the wilderness in the plain over against the red seabetween paran and tophel and laban and hazeroth and dizahab there are eleven days journey from horeb by the way of mountseir unto kadeshbarnea   and it came to pass in the fortiethyear in the eleventh month on the first day of the month that mosesspake unto the children of israel according unto all that the lordhad given him in commandment unto them  after he had slain sihonthe king of the amorites which dwelt in heshbon and og the king ofbashan which dwelt at astaroth in edrei  on this side jordan inthe land of moab began moses to declare this law saying  thelord our god spake unto us in horeb saying ye have dwelt long enoughin this mount  turn you and take your journey and go to themount of the amorites and unto all the places nigh thereunto in theplain in the hills and in the vale and in the south and by the seaside to the land of the canaanites and unto lebanon unto the greatriver the river euphrates behold i have set the land before you go in and possess the landwhich the lord sware unto your fathers abraham isaac and jacob togive unto them and to their seed after them and i spake unto you at that time saying i am not able to bearyou myself alone  the lord your god hath multiplied you andbehold ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude the lord god of your fathers make you a thousand times so manymore as ye are and bless you as he hath promised you   how cani myself alone bear your cumbrance and your burden and your strife take you wise men and understanding and known among yourtribes and i will make them rulers over you and ye answered me and said the thing which thou hast spoken isgood for us to do so i took the chief of your tribes wise men and known and madethem heads over you captains over thousands and captains overhundreds and captains over fifties and captains over tens andofficers among your tribes and i charged your judges at that time saying hear the causesbetween your brethren and judge righteously between every man and hisbrother and the stranger that is with him ye shall not respect persons in judgment but ye shall hear thesmall as well as the great ye shall not be afraid of the face of manfor the judgment is gods and the cause that is too hard for youbring it unto me and i will hear it and i commanded you at that time all the things which ye shoulddo and when we departed from horeb we went through all that greatand terrible wilderness which ye saw by the way of the mountain ofthe amorites as the lord our god commanded us and we came tokadeshbarnea and i said unto you ye are come unto the mountain of theamorites which the lord our god doth give unto us behold the lord thy god hath set the land before thee go up andpossess it as the lord god of thy fathers hath said unto thee fearnot neither be discouraged and ye came near unto me every one of you and said we will sendmen before us and they shall search us out the land and bring usword again by what way we must go up and into what cities we shallcome and the saying pleased me well and i took twelve men of you oneof a tribe  and they turned and went up into the mountain andcame unto the valley of eshcol and searched it out and they took of the fruit of the land in their hands andbrought it down unto us and brought us word again and said it is agood land which the lord our god doth give us notwithstanding ye would not go up but rebelled against thecommandment of the lord your god  and ye murmured in your tentsand said because the lord hated us he hath brought us forth out ofthe land of egypt to deliver us into the hand of the amorites todestroy us whither shall we go up our brethren have discouraged our heartsaying the people is greater and taller than we the cities are greatand walled up to heaven and moreover we have seen the sons of theanakims there then i said unto you dread not neither be afraid of them the lord your god which goeth before you he shall fight for youaccording to all that he did for you in egypt before your eyes and in the wilderness where thou hast seen how that the lord thy godbare thee as a man doth bear his son in all the way that ye wentuntil ye came into this place yet in this thing ye did not believe the lord your god  whowent in the way before you to search you out a place to pitch yourtents in in fire by night to shew you by what way ye should go andin a cloud by day and the lord heard the voice of your words and was wroth andsware saying  surely there shall not one of these men of thisevil generation see that good land which i sware to give unto yourfathers save caleb the son of jephunneh he shall see it and to him willi give the land that he hath trodden upon and to his childrenbecause he hath wholly followed the lord also the lord was angry with me for your sakes saying thou alsoshalt not go in thither but joshua the son of nun which standeth before thee he shallgo in thither encourage him for he shall cause israel to inherit it moreover your little ones which ye said should be a prey andyour children which in that day had no knowledge between good andevil they shall go in thither and unto them will i give it and theyshall possess it but as for you turn you and take your journey into thewilderness by the way of the red sea then ye answered and said unto me we have sinned against thelord we will go up and fight according to all that the lord our godcommanded usand when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war ye were readyto go up into the hill and the lord said unto me say unto them go not up neitherfight for i am not among you lest ye be smitten before your enemies so i spake unto you and ye would not hear but rebelled againstthe commandment of the lord and went presumptuously up into the hill and the amorites which dwelt in that mountain came out againstyou and chased you as bees do and destroyed you in seir even untohormah and ye returned and wept before the lord but the lord would nothearken to your voice nor give ear unto you so ye abode in kadesh many days according unto the days that yeabode there then we turned and took our journey into the wilderness by theway of the red sea as the lord spake unto me and we compassed mountseir many days and the lord spake unto me saying  ye have compassed thismountain long enough turn you northward and command thou the people saying ye are to pass through thecoast of your brethren the children of esau which dwell in seir andthey shall be afraid of you take ye good heed unto yourselvestherefore  meddle not with them for i will not give you of theirland no not so much as a foot breadth because i have given mountseir unto esau for a possession ye shall buy meat of them for money that ye may eat and ye shallalso buy water of them for money that ye may drink for the lord thy god hath blessed thee in all the works of thyhand he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness theseforty years the lord thy god hath been with thee thou hast lackednothing and when we passed by from our brethren the children of esauwhich dwelt in seir through the way of the plain from elath and fromeziongaber we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of moab and the lord said unto me distress not the moabites neithercontend with them in battle for i will not give thee of their landfor a possession because i have given ar unto the children of lot fora possession the emims dwelt therein in times past a people great and manyand tall as the anakims  which also were accounted giants asthe anakims but the moabites called them emims the horims also dwelt in seir beforetime but the children ofesau succeeded them when they had destroyed them from before themand dwelt in their stead as israel did unto the land of hispossession which the lord gave unto them now rise up said i and get you over the brook zered and wewent over the brook zered and the space in which we came from kadeshbarnea until we werecome over the brook zered was thirty and eight years until all thegeneration of the men of war were wasted out from among the host asthe lord sware unto them for indeed the hand of the lord was against them to destroy themfrom among the host until they were consumed so it came to pass when all the men of war were consumed anddead from among the people  that the lord spake unto me saying thou art to pass over through ar the coast of moab this day and when thou comest nigh over against the children of ammondistress them not nor meddle with them for i will not give thee ofthe land of the children of ammon any possession because i have givenit unto the children of lot for a possession that also was accounted a land of giants giants dwelt thereinin old time and the ammonites call them zamzummims  a peoplegreat and many and tall as the anakims but the lord destroyed thembefore them and they succeeded them and dwelt in their stead as he did to the children of esau which dwelt in seir when hedestroyed the horims from before them and they succeeded them anddwelt in their stead even unto this day  and the avims whichdwelt in hazerim even unto azzah the caphtorims which came forthout of caphtor destroyed them and dwelt in their stead   riseye up take your journey and pass over the river arnon behold ihave given into thine hand sihon the amorite king of heshbon and hisland begin to possess it and contend with him in battle this day will i begin to put the dread of thee and the fear ofthee upon the nations that are under the whole heaven who shall hearreport of thee and shall tremble and be in anguish because of thee and i sent messengers out of the wilderness of kedemoth untosihon king of heshbon with words of peace saying  let me passthrough thy land i will go along by the high way i will neither turnunto the right hand nor to the left thou shalt sell me meat for money that i may eat and give mewater for money that i may drink only i will pass through on myfeet  as the children of esau which dwell in seir and themoabites which dwell in ar did unto me until i shall pass overjordan into the land which the lord our god giveth us but sihon king of heshbon would not let us pass by him for thelord thy god hardened his spirit and made his heart obstinate thathe might deliver him into thy hand as appeareth this day and the lord said unto me behold i have begun to give sihon andhis land before thee begin to possess that thou mayest inherit hisland then sihon came out against us he and all his people to fightat jahaz and the lord our god delivered him before us and we smote himand his sons and all his people and we took all his cities at that time and utterly destroyedthe men and the women and the little ones of every city we leftnone to remain  only the cattle we took for a prey untoourselves and the spoil of the cities which we took from aroer which is by the brink of the river of arnon and fromthe city that is by the river even unto gilead there was not onecity too strong for us the lord our god delivered all unto us only unto the land of the children of ammon thou camest not nor untoany place of the river jabbok nor unto the cities in the mountainsnor unto whatsoever the lord our god forbad us then we turned and went up the way to bashan and og the king ofbashan came out against us he and all his people to battle at edrei and the lord said unto me fear him not for i will deliver himand all his people and his land into thy hand and thou shalt dounto him as thou didst unto sihon king of the amorites which dwelt atheshbon so the lord our god delivered into our hands og also the king ofbashan and all his people and we smote him until none was left tohim remaining and we took all his cities at that time there was not a citywhich we took not from them threescore cities all the region ofargob the kingdom of og in bashan all these cities were fenced with high walls gates and barsbeside unwalled towns a great many and we utterly destroyed them as we did unto sihon king ofheshbon utterly destroying the men women and children of everycity but all the cattle and the spoil of the cities we took for aprey to ourselves and we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of theamorites the land that was on this side jordan from the river ofarnon unto mount hermon  which hermon the sidonians call sirionand the amorites call it shenir  all the cities of the plainand all gilead and all bashan unto salchah and edrei cities of thekingdom of og in bashan for only og king of bashan remained of the remnant of giantsbehold his bedstead was a bedstead of iron is it not in rabbath ofthe children of ammon nine cubits was the length thereof and fourcubits the breadth of it after the cubit of a man and this land which we possessed at that time from aroer whichis by the river arnon and half mount gilead and the cities thereofgave i unto the reubenites and to the gadites and the rest of gilead and all bashan being the kingdom of oggave i unto the half tribe of manasseh all the region of argob withall bashan which was called the land of giants jair the son of manasseh took all the country of argob unto thecoasts of geshuri and maachathi and called them after his own namebashanhavothjair unto this day and i gave gilead unto machir and unto the reubenites and unto the gadites i gave from gileadeven unto the river arnon half the valley and the border even untothe river jabbok which is the border of the children of ammon the plain also and jordan and the coast thereof from chinneretheven unto the sea of the plain even the salt sea under ashdothpisgaheastward and i commanded you at that time saying the lord your god hathgiven you this land to possess it ye shall pass over armed beforeyour brethren the children of israel all that are meet for the war but your wives and your little ones and your cattle for iknow that ye have much cattle shall abide in your cities which ihave given you  until the lord have given rest unto yourbrethren as well as unto you and until they also possess the landwhich the lord your god hath given them beyond jordan and then shallye return every man unto his possession which i have given you and i commanded joshua at that time saying thine eyes have seenall that the lord your god hath done unto these two kings so shallthe lord do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest ye shall not fear them for the lord your god he shall fight foryou and i besought the lord at that time saying  o lord godthou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness and thy mightyhand for what god is there in heaven or in earth that can doaccording to thy works and according to thy might   i pray theelet me go over and see the good land that is beyond jordan thatgoodly mountain and lebanon but the lord was wroth with me for your sakes and would not hearme and the lord said unto me let it suffice thee speak no more untome of this matter get thee up into the top of pisgah and lift up thine eyeswestward and northward and southward and eastward and behold itwith thine eyes for thou shalt not go over this jordan but charge joshua and encourage him and strengthen him for heshall go over before this people and he shall cause them to inheritthe land which thou shalt see so we abode in the valley over against bethpeor now therefore hearken o israel unto the statutes and unto thejudgments which i teach you for to do them that ye may live and goin and possess the land which the lord god of your fathers giveth you ye shall not add unto the word which i command you neither shallye diminish ought from it that ye may keep the commandments of thelord your god which i command you your eyes have seen what the lord did because of baalpeor for allthe men that followed baalpeor the lord thy god hath destroyed themfrom among you but ye that did cleave unto the lord your god are alive every oneof you this day behold i have taught you statutes and judgments even as the lordmy god commanded me that ye should do so in the land whither ye go topossess it keep therefore and do them for this is your wisdom and yourunderstanding in the sight of the nations which shall hear all thesestatutes and say surely this great nation is a wise andunderstanding people for what nation is there so great who hath god so nigh unto themas the lord our god is in all things that we call upon him for  and what nation is there so great that hath statutes and judgments sorighteous as all this law which i set before you this day   onlytake heed to thyself and keep thy soul diligently lest thou forgetthe things which thine eyes have seen and lest they depart from thyheart all the days of thy life but teach them thy sons and thy sonssons  specially the day that thou stoodest before the lord thygod in horeb when the lord said unto me gather me the peopletogether and i will make them hear my words that they may learn tofear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth and thatthey may teach their children and ye came near and stood under the mountain and the mountainburned with fire unto the midst of heaven with darkness clouds andthick darkness and the lord spake unto you out of the midst of the fire yeheard the voice of the words but saw no similitude only ye heard avoice and he declared unto you his covenant which he commanded you toperform even ten commandments and he wrote them upon two tables ofstone and the lord commanded me at that time to teach you statutes andjudgments that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over topossess it take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves for ye saw no mannerof similitude on the day that the lord spake unto you in horeb out ofthe midst of the fire  lest ye corrupt yourselves and make you agraven image the similitude of any figure the likeness of male orfemale  the likeness of any beast that is on the earth thelikeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air  the likenessof any thing that creepeth on the ground the likeness of any fishthat is in the waters beneath the earth  and lest thou lift upthine eyes unto heaven and when thou seest the sun and the moon andthe stars even all the host of heaven shouldest be driven to worshipthem and serve them which the lord thy god hath divided unto allnations under the whole heaven but the lord hath taken you and brought you forth out of theiron furnace even out of egypt to be unto him a people ofinheritance as ye are this day furthermore the lord was angry with me for your sakes and swarethat i should not go over jordan and that i should not go in untothat good land which the lord thy god giveth thee for an inheritance but i must die in this land i must not go over jordan but yeshall go over and possess that good land take heed unto yourselves lest ye forget the covenant of thelord your god which he made with you and make you a graven image orthe likeness of any thing which the lord thy god hath forbidden thee for the lord thy god is a consuming fire even a jealous god when thou shalt beget children and childrens children and yeshall have remained long in the land and shall corrupt yourselvesand make a graven image or the likeness of any thing and shall doevil in the sight of the lord thy god to provoke him to anger  icall heaven and earth to witness against you this day that ye shallsoon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over jordan topossess it ye shall not prolong your days upon it but shall utterlybe destroyed and the lord shall scatter you among the nations and ye shall beleft few in number among the heathen whither the lord shall lead you and there ye shall serve gods the work of mens hands wood andstone which neither see nor hear nor eat nor smell but if from thence thou shalt seek the lord thy god thou shaltfind him if thou seek him with all thy heart and with all thy soul when thou art in tribulation and all these things are come uponthee even in the latter days if thou turn to the lord thy god andshalt be obedient unto his voice  for the lord thy god is amerciful god he will not forsake thee neither destroy thee norforget the covenant of thy fathers which he sware unto them for ask now of the days that are past which were before theesince the day that god created man upon the earth and ask from theone side of heaven unto the other whether there hath been any suchthing as this great thing is or hath been heard like it   didever people hear the voice of god speaking out of the midst of thefire as thou hast heard and live   or hath god assayed to goand take him a nation from the midst of another nation bytemptations by signs and by wonders and by war and by a mightyhand and by a stretched out arm and by great terrors according toall that the lord your god did for you in egypt before your eyes unto thee it was shewed that thou mightest know that the lord heis god there is none else beside him out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice that he mightinstruct thee and upon earth he shewed thee his great fire and thouheardest his words out of the midst of the fire and because he loved thy fathers therefore he chose their seedafter them and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty powerout of egypt  to drive out nations from before thee greater andmightier than thou art to bring thee in to give thee their land foran inheritance as it is this day know therefore this day and consider it in thine heart that thelord he is god in heaven above and upon the earth beneath there isnone else thou shalt keep therefore his statutes and his commandmentswhich i command thee this day that it may go well with thee and withthy children after thee and that thou mayest prolong thy days uponthe earth which the lord thy god giveth thee for ever then moses severed three cities on this side jordan toward thesunrising  that the slayer might flee thither which should killhis neighbour unawares and hated him not in times past and thatfleeing unto one of these cities he might live  namely bezer inthe wilderness in the plain country of the reubenites and ramoth ingilead of the gadites and golan in bashan of the manassites and this is the law which moses set before the children ofisrael  these are the testimonies and the statutes and thejudgments which moses spake unto the children of israel after theycame forth out of egypt on this side jordan in the valley over against bethpeor in theland of sihon king of the amorites who dwelt at heshbon whom mosesand the children of israel smote after they were come forth out ofegypt  and they possessed his land and the land of og king ofbashan two kings of the amorites which were on this side jordantoward the sunrising  from aroer which is by the bank of theriver arnon even unto mount sion which is hermon  and all theplain on this side jordan eastward even unto the sea of the plainunder the springs of pisgah and moses called all israel and said unto them hear o israelthe statutes and judgments which i speak in your ears this day thatye may learn them and keep and do them the lord our god made a covenant with us in horeb the lord made not this covenant with our fathers but with useven us who are all of us here alive this day the lord talked with you face to face in the mount out of themidst of the fire  i stood between the lord and you at that timeto shew you the word of the lord for ye were afraid by reason of thefire and went not up into the mount saying  i am the lord thygod which brought thee out of the land of egypt from the house ofbondage thou shalt have none other gods before me thou shalt not make thee any graven image or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above or that is in the earth beneath orthat is in the waters beneath the earth  thou shalt not bow downthyself unto them nor serve them for i the lord thy god am a jealousgod visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto thethird and fourth generation of them that hate me  and shewingmercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments thou shalt not take the name of the lord thy god in vain for thelord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain keep the sabbath day to sanctify it as the lord thy god hathcommanded thee six days thou shalt labour and do all thy work  but theseventh day is the sabbath of the lord thy god in it thou shalt notdo any work thou nor thy son nor thy daughter nor thy manservantnor thy maidservant nor thine ox nor thine ass nor any of thycattle nor thy stranger that is within thy gates that thy manservantand thy maidservant may rest as well as thou and remember that thou wast a servant in the land of egypt andthat the lord thy god brought thee out thence through a mighty handand by a stretched out arm therefore the lord thy god commanded theeto keep the sabbath day honour thy father and thy mother as the lord thy god hathcommanded thee that thy days may be prolonged and that it may gowell with thee in the land which the lord thy god giveth thee thou shalt not kill neither shalt thou commit adultery neither shalt thou steal neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour neither shalt thou desire thy neighbours wife neither shaltthou covet thy neighbours house his field or his manservant or hismaidservant his ox or his ass or any thing that is thy neighbours these words the lord spake unto all your assembly in the mountout of the midst of the fire of the cloud and of the thick darknesswith a great voice and he added no more and he wrote them in twotables of stone and delivered them unto me and it came to pass when ye heard the voice out of the midst ofthe darkness for the mountain did burn with fire that ye came nearunto me even all the heads of your tribes and your elders  andye said behold the lord our god hath shewed us his glory and hisgreatness and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the firewe have seen this day that god doth talk with man and he liveth now therefore why should we die for this great fire will consumeus if we hear the voice of the lord our god any more then we shalldie for who is there of all flesh that hath heard the voice of theliving god speaking out of the midst of the fire as we have andlived   go thou near and hear all that the lord our god shallsay and speak thou unto us all that the lord our god shall speak untothee and we will hear it and do it and the lord heard the voice of your words when ye spake untome and the lord said unto me i have heard the voice of the words ofthis people which they have spoken unto thee they have well said allthat they have spoken o that there were such an heart in them that they would fear meand keep all my commandments always that it might be well with themand with their children for ever   go say to them get you intoyour tents again but as for thee stand thou here by me and i will speak untothee all the commandments and the statutes and the judgments whichthou shalt teach them that they may do them in the land which i givethem to possess it ye shall observe to do therefore as the lord your god hathcommanded you ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to theleft ye shall walk in all the ways which the lord your god hathcommanded you that ye may live and that it may be well with you andthat ye may prolong your days in the land which ye shall possess now these are the commandments the statutes and the judgmentswhich the lord your god commanded to teach you that ye might do themin the land whither ye go to possess it  that thou mightest fearthe lord thy god to keep all his statutes and his commandments whichi command thee thou and thy son and thy sons son all the days ofthy life and that thy days may be prolonged hear therefore o israel and observe to do it that it may bewell with thee and that ye may increase mightily as the lord god ofthy fathers hath promised thee in the land that floweth with milk andhoney hear o israel the lord our god is one lord  and thou shaltlove the lord thy god with all thine heart and with all thy soul andwith all thy might and these words which i command thee this day shall be in thineheart  and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children andshalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house and when thouwalkest by the way and when thou liest down and when thou risest up and thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand and theyshall be as frontlets between thine eyes and thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house and on thygates and it shall be when the lord thy god shall have brought theeinto the land which he sware unto thy fathers to abraham to isaacand to jacob to give thee great and goodly cities which thoubuildedst not  and houses full of all good things which thoufilledst not and wells digged which thou diggedst not vineyards andolive trees which thou plantedst not when thou shalt have eaten andbe full  then beware lest thou forget the lord which broughtthee forth out of the land of egypt from the house of bondage thou shalt fear the lord thy god and serve him and shalt swearby his name ye shall not go after other gods of the gods of the people whichare round about you  for the lord thy god is a jealous god amongyou lest the anger of the lord thy god be kindled against thee anddestroy thee from off the face of the earth ye shall not tempt the lord your god as ye tempted him inmassah ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the lord your godand his testimonies and his statutes which he hath commanded thee and thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight ofthe lord that it may be well with thee and that thou mayest go inand possess the good land which the lord sware unto thy fathers to cast out all thine enemies from before thee as the lord hathspoken and when thy son asketh thee in time to come saying what meanthe testimonies and the statutes and the judgments which the lordour god hath commanded you   then thou shalt say unto thy son wewere pharaohs bondmen in egypt and the lord brought us out of egyptwith a mighty hand  and the lord shewed signs and wonders greatand sore upon egypt upon pharaoh and upon all his household beforeour eyes  and he brought us out from thence that he might bringus in to give us the land which he sware unto our fathers and the lord commanded us to do all these statutes to fear thelord our god for our good always that he might preserve us alive asit is at this day and it shall be our righteousness if we observe to do all thesecommandments before the lord our god as he hath commanded us when the lord thy god shall bring thee into the land whither thougoest to possess it and hath cast out many nations before thee thehittites and the girgashites and the amorites and the canaanitesand the perizzites and the hivites and the jebusites seven nationsgreater and mightier than thou  and when the lord thy god shalldeliver them before thee thou shalt smite them and utterly destroythem thou shalt make no covenant with them nor shew mercy unto them neither shalt thou make marriages with them thy daughter thoushalt not give unto his son nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thyson for they will turn away thy son from following me that they mayserve other gods so will the anger of the lord be kindled againstyou and destroy thee suddenly but thus shall ye deal with them ye shall destroy their altarsand break down their images and cut down their groves and burn theirgraven images with fire for thou art an holy people unto the lord thy god the lord thygod hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself above allpeople that are upon the face of the earth the lord did not set his love upon you nor choose you because yewere more in number than any people for ye were the fewest of allpeople  but because the lord loved you and because he would keepthe oath which he had sworn unto your fathers hath the lord broughtyou out with a mighty hand and redeemed you out of the house ofbondmen from the hand of pharaoh king of egypt know therefore that the lord thy god he is god the faithful godwhich keepeth

thesejudgments and keep and do them that the lord thy god shall keepunto thee the covenant and the mercy which he sware unto thy fathers and he will love thee and bless thee and multiply thee he willalso bless the fruit of thy womb and the fruit of thy land thy cornand thy wine and thine oil the increase of thy kine and the flocksof thy sheep in the land which he sware unto thy fathers to givethee thou shalt be blessed above all people there shall not be maleor female barren among you or among your cattle and the lord will take away from thee all sickness and will putnone of the evil

before your face soshall ye perish because ye would not be obedient unto the voice ofthe lord your god hear o israel thou art to pass over jordan this day to go in topossess nations greater and mightier than thyself cities great andfenced up to heaven  a people great and tall the children of theanakims whom thou knowest and of whom thou hast heard say who canstand before the children of anak   understand therefore this daythat the lord thy god is he which goeth over before thee as aconsuming fire he shall destroy them and he shall bring them downbefore thy face so shalt thou drive them out and destroy themquickly as the lord hath said unto thee speak not thou in thine heart after that the lord thy god hathcast them out from before thee saying for my righteousness the lordhath brought me in to possess this land but for the wickedness ofthese nations the lord doth drive them out from before thee not for thy righteousness or for the uprightness of thine heartdost thou go to possess their land but for the wickedness of thesenations the lord thy god doth drive them out from before thee andthat he may perform the word which the lord sware unto thy fathersabraham isaac and jacob understand therefore that the lord thy god giveth thee not thisgood land to possess it for thy righteousness for thou art astiffnecked people remember and forget not how thou provokedst the lord thy god towrath in the wilderness from the day that thou didst depart out ofthe land of egypt until ye came unto this place ye have beenrebellious against the lord also in horeb ye provoked the lord to wrath so that the lord wasangry with you to have destroyed you when i was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stoneeven the tables of the covenant which the lord made with you then iabode in the mount forty days and forty nights i neither did eatbread nor drink water  and the lord delivered unto me two tablesof stone written with the finger of god and on them was writtenaccording to all the words which the lord spake with you in the mountout of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly and it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nightsthat the lord gave me the two tables of stone even the tables of thecovenant and the lord said unto me arise get thee down quickly fromhence for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of egypt havecorrupted themselves they are quickly turned aside out of the waywhich i commanded them they have made them a molten image furthermore the lord spake unto me saying i have seen thispeople and behold it is a stiffnecked people  let me alonethat i may destroy them and blot out their name from under heavenand i will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they so i turned and came down from the mount and the mount burnedwith fire and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands and i looked and behold ye had sinned against the lord yourgod and had made you a molten calf ye had turned aside quickly outof the way which the lord had commanded you and i took the two tables and cast them out of my two hands andbrake them before your eyes and i fell down before the lord as at the first forty days andforty nights i did neither eat bread nor drink water because of allyour sins which ye sinned in doing wickedly in the sight of the lordto provoke him to anger for i was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure wherewith thelord was wroth against you to destroy you but the lord hearkened untome at that time also and the lord was very angry with aaron to have destroyed him andi prayed for aaron also the same time and i took your sin the calf which ye had made and burnt itwith fire and stamped it and ground it very small even until it wasas small as dust and i cast the dust thereof into the brook thatdescended out of the mount and at taberah and at massah and at kibrothhattaavah yeprovoked the lord to wrath likewise when the lord sent you from kadeshbarnea saying go upand possess the land which i have given you then ye rebelled againstthe commandment of the lord your god and ye believed him not norhearkened to his voice ye have been rebellious against the lord from the day that i knewyou thus i fell down before the lord forty days and forty nights asi fell down at the first because the lord had said he would destroyyou i prayed therefore unto the lord and said o lord god destroynot thy people and thine inheritance which thou hast redeemed throughthy greatness which thou hast brought forth out of egypt with amighty hand remember thy servants abraham isaac and jacob look not untothe stubbornness of this people nor to their wickedness nor to theirsin  lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say because thelord was not able to bring them into the land which he promised themand because he hated them he hath brought them out to slay them inthe wilderness yet they are thy people and thine inheritance which thoubroughtest out by thy mighty power and by thy stretched out arm at that time the lord said unto me hew thee two tables of stonelike unto the first and come up unto me into the mount and make theean ark of wood and i will write on the tables the words that were in the firsttables which thou brakest and thou shalt put them in the ark and i made an ark of shittim wood and hewed two tables of stonelike unto the first and went up into the mount having the two tablesin mine hand and he wrote on the tables according to the first writing theten commandments which the lord spake unto you in the mount out ofthe midst of the fire in the day of the assembly and the lord gavethem unto me and i turned myself and came down from the mount and put thetables in the ark which i had made and there they be as the lordcommanded me and the children of israel took their journey from beeroth of thechildren of jaakan to mosera there aaron died and there he wasburied and eleazar his son ministered in the priests office in hisstead from thence they journeyed unto gudgodah and from gudgodah tojotbath a land of rivers of waters at that time the lord separated the tribe of levi to bear theark of the covenant of the lord to stand before the lord to ministerunto him and to bless in his name unto this day wherefore levi hath no part nor inheritance with his brethrenthe lord is his inheritance according as the lord thy god promisedhim and i stayed in the mount according to the first time fortydays and forty nights and the lord hearkened unto me at that timealso and the lord would not destroy thee and the lord said unto me arise take thy journey before thepeople that they may go in and possess the land which i sware untotheir fathers to give unto them and now israel what doth the lord thy god require of thee butto fear the lord thy god to walk in all his ways and to love himand to serve the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thysoul  to keep the commandments of the lord and his statuteswhich i command thee this day for thy good   behold the heavenand the heaven of heavens is the lords thy god the earth also withall that therein is only the lord had a delight in thy fathers to love them and hechose

greatgod a mighty and a terrible which regardeth not persons nor takethreward  he doth execute the judgment of the fatherless andwidow and loveth the stranger in giving him food and raiment love ye

midst ofegypt unto pharaoh the king of egypt and unto all his land  andwhat he did unto the army of egypt unto their horses and to theirchariots how he made the water of the red sea to overflow them asthey pursued after you and how the lord hath destroyed them unto thisday  and what he did unto you in the wilderness until ye cameinto this place  and what he did unto dathan and abiram the sonsof eliab the son of reuben how the earth opened her mouth andswallowed them up and their households and their tents and all thesubstance that was in their possession in the midst of all israel but your

goest in to possess it is not as theland of egypt from whence ye came out where thou sowedst thy seedand wateredst it with thy foot as a garden of herbs  but theland whither ye go to possess it is a land of hills and valleys anddrinketh water of the rain of heaven  a land which the lord thygod careth for the eyes of the lord thy god are always upon it fromthe beginning of the year even unto the

and it shall be when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdomthat he shall write him a copy of this law in a book out of that whichis before the priests the levites  and it shall be with him andhe shall read therein all the days of his life that he may learn tofear the lord his god to keep all the words of this law and thesestatutes to do them  that his heart be not lifted up above hisbrethren and that he turn not aside from the commandment to theright hand or to the left to the end that he may prolong his days inhis kingdom he and his children in the midst of israel the priests the levites and all the tribe of levi shall have nopart nor inheritance with israel they shall eat the offerings of thelord made by fire and his inheritance therefore shall they have no inheritance among their

the desire of his mind unto theplace which the lord shall choose  then he shall minister in thename of the lord his god as all his brethren the levites do whichstand there before the lord they shall have like portions to eat beside that which cometh ofthe sale of his patrimony when thou art come into the land which the lord thy god giveththee thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations of thosenations there shall not be found among you any one that maketh his sonor his daughter to pass through the fire or that useth divination oran observer of times or an enchanter or a witch or a

outfrom before thee thou shalt be perfect with the lord thy god for these nations which thou shalt possess hearkened untoobservers of times and unto diviners but as for thee the lord thygod hath not suffered thee so to do the lord thy god will raise up unto thee a prophet from themidst of thee of thy brethren like unto me unto him ye shallhearken  according to all that thou desiredst of the lord thygod in horeb in the day of the assembly saying let me not hear againthe voice of the lord my god neither let me see this great fire anymore that i die not and the lord said unto me they have well spoken that which theyhave spoken i will raise them up a prophet from among their brethren likeunto thee and will put my words in his mouth and he shall speak untothem all that i shall command him and it shall come to pass that whosoever will not hearken untomy words which he shall speak in my name i will require it of him but the prophet which shall presume to speak a word in my namewhich i have not commanded him to speak or that shall speak in thename of other gods even that prophet shall die and if thou say in thine heart how shall we know the word whichthe lord hath not spoken   when a prophet speaketh in the nameof the lord if the thing follow not nor come to pass that is thething which the lord hath not spoken but the prophet hath spoken itpresumptuously thou shalt not be afraid of him when the lord thy god hath cut off the nations whose land thelord thy god giveth thee and thou succeedest them and dwellest intheir cities and in their houses  thou shalt separate threecities for thee in the midst of thy land which the lord thy godgiveth thee to possess it thou shalt prepare thee a way and divide the coasts of thy landwhich the lord thy god giveth thee to inherit into three parts thatevery slayer may flee thither and this is the case of the slayer which shall flee thitherthat he may live whoso killeth his neighbour ignorantly whom hehated not in time past  as when a man goeth into the wood withhis neighbour to hew wood and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axeto cut down the tree and the head slippeth from the helve andlighteth upon his neighbour that he die he shall flee unto one ofthose cities and live  lest the avenger of the blood pursue theslayer while his heart is hot and overtake him because the way islong and slay him whereas he was not worthy of death inasmuch as hehated him not in time past wherefore i command thee saying thou shalt separate threecities for thee and if the lord thy god enlarge thy coast as he hath sworn untothy fathers and give thee all the land which he promised to give untothy fathers  if thou shalt keep all these commandments to dothem which i command thee this day to love the lord thy god and towalk ever in his ways then shalt thou add three cities more for theebeside these three  that innocent blood be not shed in thy landwhich the lord thy god giveth thee for an inheritance and so blood beupon thee but if any man hate his neighbour and lie in wait for him andrise up against him and smite him mortally that he die and fleethinto one of these cities  then the elders of his city shall sendand fetch him thence and deliver him into the hand of the avenger ofblood that he may die thine eye shall not pity him but thou shalt put away the guiltof innocent blood from israel that it may go well with thee thou shalt not remove thy neighbours landmark which they ofold time have set in thine inheritance which thou shalt inherit inthe land that the lord thy god giveth thee to possess it one witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity orfor any sin in any sin that he sinneth at the mouth of twowitnesses or at the mouth of three witnesses shall the matter beestablished if a false witness rise up against any man to testify againsthim that which is wrong  then both the men between whom thecontroversy is shall stand before the lord before the priests andthe judges which shall be in those days  and the judges shallmake diligent inquisition and behold if the witness be a falsewitness and hath testified falsely against his brother  thenshall ye do unto him as he had thought to have done unto his brotherso shalt thou put the evil away from among you and those which remain shall hear and fear and shallhenceforth commit no more any such evil among you and thine eye shall not pity but life shall go for life eyefor eye tooth for tooth hand for hand foot for foot when thou goest out to battle against thine enemies and seesthorses and chariots and a people more than thou be not afraid ofthem for the lord thy god is with thee which brought thee up out ofthe land of egypt and it shall be when ye are come nigh unto the battle that thepriest shall approach and speak unto the people  and shall sayunto them hear o israel ye approach this day unto battle againstyour enemies let not your hearts faint fear not and do not trembleneither be ye terrified because of them  for the lord your god ishe that goeth with you to fight for you against your enemies to saveyou and the officers shall speak unto the people saying what man isthere that hath built a new house and hath not dedicated it let himgo and return to his house lest he die in the battle and another mandedicate it and what man is he that hath planted a vineyard and hath not yeteaten of it let him also go and return unto his house lest he die inthe battle and another man eat of it and what man is there that hath betrothed a wife and hath nottaken her let him go and return unto his house lest he die in thebattle and another man take her and the officers shall speak further unto the people and theyshall say what man is there that is fearful and fainthearted let himgo and return unto his house lest his brethrens heart faint as wellas his heart and it shall be when the officers have made an end of speakingunto the people that they shall make captains of the armies to leadthe people when thou comest nigh unto a city to fight against it thenproclaim peace unto it and it shall be if it make thee answer of peace and open untothee then it shall be that all the people that is found thereinshall be tributaries unto thee and they shall serve thee and if it will make no peace with thee but will make waragainst thee then thou shalt besiege it  and when the lord thygod hath delivered it into thine hands thou shalt smite every malethereof with the edge of the sword  but the women and thelittle ones and the cattle and all that is in the city even all thespoil thereof shalt thou take unto thyself and thou shalt eat thespoil of thine enemies which the lord thy god hath given thee thus shalt thou do unto all the cities which are very far offfrom thee which are not of the cities of these nations but of the cities of these people which the lord thy god dothgive thee for an inheritance thou shalt save alive nothing thatbreatheth  but thou shalt utterly destroy them namely thehittites and the amorites the canaanites and the perizzites thehivites and the jebusites as the lord thy god hath commanded thee that they teach you not to do after all their abominationswhich they have done unto their gods so should ye sin against thelord your god when thou shalt besiege a city a long time in making waragainst it to take it thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof byforcing an axe against them for thou mayest eat of them and thoushalt not cut them down for the tree of the field is mans life toemploy them in the siege  only the trees which thou knowest thatthey be not trees for meat thou shalt destroy and cut them down andthou shalt build bulwarks against the city that maketh war with theeuntil it be subdued if one be found slain in the land which the lord thy god giveththee to possess it lying in the field and it be not known who hathslain him  then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth andthey shall measure unto the cities which are round about him that isslain  and it shall be that the city which is next unto theslain man even the elders of that city shall take an heifer whichhath not been wrought with and which hath not drawn in the yoke and the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a roughvalley which is neither eared nor sown and shall strike off theheifers neck there in the valley  and the priests the sons oflevi shall come near for them the lord thy god hath chosen tominister unto him and to bless in the name of the lord and by theirword shall every controversy and every stroke be tried  and allthe elders of that city that are next unto the slain man shall washtheir hands over the heifer that is beheaded in the valley  andthey shall answer and say our hands have not shed this blood neitherhave our eyes seen it be merciful o lord unto thy people israel whom thou hastredeemed and lay not innocent blood unto thy people of israelscharge and the blood shall be forgiven them so shalt thou put away the guilt of innocent blood from amongyou when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of the lord when thou goest forth to war against thine enemies and the lordthy god hath delivered them into thine hands and thou hast taken themcaptive  and seest among the captives a beautiful woman andhast a desire unto her that thou wouldest have her to thy wife then thou shalt bring her home to thine house and she shall shave herhead and pare her nails  and she shall put the raiment of hercaptivity from off her and shall remain in thine house and bewailher father and her mother a full month and after that thou shalt goin unto her and be her husband and she shall be thy wife and it shall be if thou have no delight in her then thou shaltlet her go whither she will but thou shalt not sell her at all formoney thou shalt not make merchandise of her because thou hasthumbled her if a man have two wives one beloved and another hated andthey have born him children both the beloved and the hated and ifthe firstborn son be hers that was hated  then it shall be whenhe maketh his sons to inherit that which he hath that he may not makethe son of the beloved firstborn before the son of the hated which isindeed the firstborn  but he shall acknowledge the son of thehated for the firstborn by giving him a double portion of all that hehath for he is the beginning of his strength the right of thefirstborn is his if a man have a stubborn and rebellious son which will not obeythe voice of his father or the voice of his mother and that whenthey have chastened him will not hearken unto them  then shallhis father and his mother lay hold on him and bring him out unto theelders of his city and unto the gate of his place  and theyshall say unto the elders of his city this our son is stubborn andrebellious he will not obey our voice he is a glutton and adrunkard and all the men of his city shall stone him with stones that hedie so shalt thou put evil away from among you and all israel shallhear and fear and if a man have committed a sin worthy of death and he be tobe put to death and thou hang him on a tree  his body shall notremain all night upon the tree but thou shalt in any wise bury himthat day for he that is

thoushalt fear and for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see and the lord shall bring thee into egypt again with ships bythe way whereof i spake unto thee thou shalt see it no more againand there ye shall be sold unto your enemies for bondmen andbondwomen and no man shall buy you these are the words of the covenant which the lord commandedmoses to make with the children of israel in the land of moab besidethe covenant which he made with them in horeb and moses called unto all israel and said unto them ye haveseen all that the lord did before your eyes in the land of egypt untopharaoh and unto all his servants and unto all his land  thegreat temptations which thine eyes have seen the signs and thosegreat miracles  yet the lord hath not given you an heart toperceive and eyes to see and ears to hear unto this day and i have led you forty years in the wilderness your clothesare not waxen old upon you and thy shoe is not waxen old upon thyfoot ye have not eaten bread neither have ye drunk wine or strongdrink that ye might know that i am the lord your god and when ye came unto this place sihon the king of heshbon andog the king of bashan came out against us unto battle and we smotethem  and we took their land and gave it for an inheritance untothe reubenites and to the gadites and to the half tribe of manasseh keep therefore the words of this covenant and do them that yemay prosper in all that ye do ye stand this day all of you before the lord your god yourcaptains of your tribes your elders and your officers with all themen of israel  your little ones your wives and thy strangerthat is in thy camp from the hewer of thy wood unto the drawer of thywater  that thou shouldest enter into covenant with the lord thygod and into his oath which the lord thy god maketh with thee thisday  that he may establish thee to day for a people untohimself and that he may be unto thee a god as he hath said untothee and as he hath sworn unto thy fathers to abraham to isaac andto jacob neither with you only do i make this covenant and this oath but with him that standeth here with us this day before the lordour god and also with him that is not here with us this day for ye know how we have dwelt in the land of egypt and how we camethrough the nations which ye passed by  and ye have seen theirabominations and their idols wood and stone silver and gold whichwere among them  lest there should be among you man or womanor family or tribe whose heart turneth away this day from the lordour god to go and serve the gods of these nations lest there shouldbe among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood  and it cometo pass when he heareth the words of this curse that he blesshimself in his heart saying i shall have peace though i walk in theimagination of mine heart to add drunkenness to thirst  thelord will not spare him but then the anger of the lord and hisjealousy shall smoke against that man and all the curses that arewritten in this book shall lie upon him and the lord shall blot outhis name from under heaven and the lord shall separate him unto evil out of all the tribesof israel according to all the curses of the covenant that arewritten in this book of the law  so that the generation to comeof your children that shall rise up after you and the stranger thatshall come from a far land shall say when they see the plagues ofthat land and the sicknesses which the lord hath laid upon it and that the whole land thereof is brimstone and salt and burningthat it is not sown nor beareth nor any grass groweth therein likethe overthrow of sodom and gomorrah admah and zeboim which thelord overthrew in his anger and in his wrath  even all nationsshall say wherefore hath the lord done thus unto this land whatmeaneth the heat of this great anger   then men shall saybecause they have forsaken the covenant of the lord god of theirfathers which he made with them when he brought them forth out of theland of egypt  for they went and served other gods andworshipped them gods whom they knew not and whom he had not givenunto them  and the anger of the lord was kindled against thisland to bring upon it all the curses that are written in this book and the lord rooted them out of their land in anger and inwrath and in great indignation and cast them into another land asit is this day the secret things belong unto the lord our god but those thingswhich are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever thatwe may do all the words of this law and it shall come to pass when all these things are come uponthee the blessing and the curse which i have set before thee andthou shalt call them to mind among all the nations whither the lordthy god hath driven thee  and shalt return unto the lord thy godand shalt obey his voice according to all that i command thee thisday thou and thy children with all thine heart and with all thysoul  that then the lord thy god will turn thy captivity andhave compassion upon thee and will return and gather thee from allthe nations whither the lord thy god hath scattered thee if any of thine be driven out unto the outmost parts of heavenfrom thence will the lord thy god gather thee and from thence will hefetch thee  and the lord thy god will bring thee into the landwhich thy fathers possessed and thou shalt possess it and he will dothee good and multiply thee above thy fathers and the lord thy god will circumcise thine heart and the heartof thy seed to love the lord thy god with all thine heart and withall thy soul that thou mayest live and the lord thy god will put all these curses upon thineenemies and on them that hate thee which persecuted thee and thou shalt return and obey the voice of the lord and do allhis commandments which i command thee this day and the lord thy god will make thee plenteous in every work ofthine hand in the fruit of thy body and in the fruit of thy cattleand in the fruit of thy land for good for the lord will againrejoice over thee for good as he rejoiced over thy fathers  ifthou shalt hearken unto the voice of the lord thy god to keep hiscommandments and his statutes which are written in this book of thelaw and if thou turn unto the lord thy god with all thine heart andwith all thy soul for this commandment which i command thee this day it is nothidden from thee neither is it far off it is not in heaven that thou shouldest say who shall go upfor us to heaven and bring it unto us that we may hear it and doit   neither is it beyond the sea that thou shouldest say whoshall go over the sea for us and bring it unto us that we may hearit and do it   but the word is very nigh unto thee in thymouth and in thy heart that thou mayest do it see i have set before thee this day life and good and deathand evil  in that i command thee this day to love the lord thygod to walk in his ways and to keep his commandments and hisstatutes and his judgments that thou mayest live and multiply andthe lord thy god shall bless thee in the land whither thou goest topossess it but if thine heart turn away so that thou wilt not hear butshalt be drawn away and worship other gods and serve them  idenounce unto you this day that ye shall surely perish and that yeshall not prolong your days upon the land whither thou passest overjordan to go to possess it i call heaven and earth to record this day against you that ihave set before you life and death blessing and cursing thereforechoose life that both thou and thy seed may live  that thoumayest love the lord thy god and that thou mayest obey his voice andthat thou mayest cleave unto him for he is thy life and the lengthof thy days that thou mayest dwell in the land which the lord swareunto thy fathers to abraham to isaac and to jacob to give them and moses went and spake these words unto all israel and he said unto them i am an hundred and twenty years old thisday i can no more go out and come in also the lord hath said untome thou shalt not go over this jordan the lord thy god he will go over before thee and he willdestroy these nations from before thee and thou shalt possess themand joshua he shall go over before thee as the lord hath said and the lord shall do unto them as he did to sihon and to ogkings of the amorites and unto the land of them whom he destroyed and the lord shall give them up before your face that ye may dounto them according unto all the commandments which i have commandedyou be strong and of a good courage fear not nor be afraid of themfor the lord thy god he it is that doth go with thee he will notfail thee nor forsake thee and moses called unto joshua and said unto him in the sight ofall israel be strong and of a good courage for thou must go withthis people unto the land which the lord hath sworn unto their fathersto give them and thou shalt cause them to inherit it and the lord he it is that doth go before thee he will be withthee he will not fail thee neither forsake thee fear not neitherbe dismayed and moses wrote this law and delivered it unto the priests thesons of levi which bare the ark of the covenant of the lord and untoall the elders of israel and moses commanded them saying at the end of every sevenyears in the solemnity of the year of release in the feast oftabernacles  when all israel is come to appear before the lordthy god in the place which he shall choose thou shalt read this lawbefore all israel in their hearing gather the people together men and women and children and thystranger that is within thy gates that they may hear and that theymay learn and fear the lord your god and observe to do all the wordsof this law  and that their children which have not known anything may hear and learn to fear the lord your god as long as yelive in the land whither ye go over jordan to possess it and the lord said unto moses behold thy days approach thatthou must die call joshua and present yourselves in the tabernacleof the congregation that i may give him a charge and moses andjoshua went and presented themselves in the tabernacle of thecongregation and the lord appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a cloudand the pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the tabernacle and the lord said unto moses behold thou shalt sleep with thyfathers and this people will rise up and go a whoring after the godsof the strangers of the land whither they go to be among them andwill forsake me and break my covenant which i have made with them then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day and iwill forsake them and i will hide my face from them and they shallbe devoured and many evils and troubles shall befall them so thatthey will say in that day are not these evils come upon us becauseour god is not among us   and i will surely hide my face in thatday for all the evils which they shall have wrought in that they areturned unto other gods now therefore write ye this song for you and teach it thechildren of israel put it in their mouths that this song may be awitness for me against the children of israel for when i shall have brought them into the land which i swareunto their fathers that floweth with milk and honey and they shallhave eaten and filled themselves and waxen fat then will they turnunto other gods and serve them and provoke me and break mycovenant and it shall come to pass when many evils and troubles arebefallen them that this song shall testify against them as a witnessfor it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed for iknow their imagination which they go about even now before i havebrought them into the land which i sware moses therefore wrote this song the same day and taught it thechildren of israel and he gave joshua the son of nun a charge and said be strongand of a good courage for thou shalt bring the children of israelinto the land which i sware unto them and i will be with thee and it came to pass when moses had made an end of writing thewords of this law in a book until they were finished  thatmoses commanded the levites which bare the ark of the covenant of thelord saying  take this book of the law and put it in the sideof the ark of the covenant of the lord your god that it may be therefor a witness against thee for i know thy rebellion and thy stiff neck behold while i amyet alive with you this day ye have been rebellious against the lordand how much more after my death   gather unto me all the eldersof your tribes and your officers that i may speak these words intheir ears and call heaven and earth to record against them for i know that after my death ye will utterly corruptyourselves and turn aside from the way which i have commanded youand evil will befall you in the latter days because ye will do evilin the sight of the lord to provoke him to anger through the work ofyour hands and moses spake in the ears of all the congregation of israelthe words of this song until they were ended give ear o ye heavens and i will speak and hear o earth thewords of my mouth my doctrine shall drop as the rain my speech shall distil as thedew as the small rain upon the tender herb and as the showers uponthe grass  because i will publish the name of the lord ascribeye greatness unto our god he is the rock his work is perfect for all his ways arejudgment a god of truth and without iniquity just and right is he they have corrupted themselves their spot is not the spot of hischildren they are a perverse and crooked generation do ye thus requite the lord o foolish people and unwise is nothe thy father that hath bought thee hath he not made thee andestablished thee   remember the days of old consider the yearsof many generations ask thy father and he will shew thee thyelders and they will tell thee when the most high divided to the nations their inheritance whenhe separated the sons of adam he set the bounds of the peopleaccording to the number of the children of israel for the lords portion is his people jacob is the lot of hisinheritance he found him in a desert land and in the waste howlingwilderness he led him about he instructed him he kept him as theapple of his eye as an eagle stirreth up her nest fluttereth over her youngspreadeth abroad her wings taketh them beareth them on her wings so the lord alone did lead him and there was no strange godwith him he made him ride on the high places of the earth that he mighteat the increase of the fields and he made him to suck honey out ofthe rock and oil out of the flinty rock  butter of kine andmilk of sheep with fat of lambs and rams of the breed of bashan andgoats with the fat of kidneys of wheat and thou didst drink the pureblood of the grape but jeshurun waxed fat and kicked thou art waxen fat thou artgrown thick thou art covered with fatness then he forsook god whichmade him and lightly esteemed the rock of his salvation they provoked him to jealousy with strange gods withabominations provoked they him to anger they sacrificed unto devils not to god to gods whom they knewnot to new gods that came newly up whom your fathers feared not of the rock that begat thee thou art unmindful and hastforgotten god that formed thee and when the lord saw it he abhorred them because of theprovoking of his sons and of his daughters and he said i will hide my face from them i will see whattheir end shall be for they are a very froward generation childrenin whom is no faith they have moved me to jealousy with that which is not god theyhave provoked me to anger with their vanities and i will move them tojealousy with those which are not a people i will provoke them toanger with a foolish nation for a fire is kindled in mine anger and shall burn unto thelowest hell and shall consume the earth with her increase and set onfire the foundations of the mountains i will heap mischiefs upon them i will spend mine arrows uponthem they shall be burnt with hunger and devoured with burning heatand with bitter destruction i will also send the teeth of beasts uponthem with the poison of serpents of the dust the sword without and terror within shall destroy both theyoung man and the virgin the suckling also with the man of grayhairs i said i would scatter them into corners i would make theremembrance of them to cease from among men  were it not that ifeared the wrath of the enemy lest their adversaries should behavethemselves strangely and lest they should say our hand is high andthe lord hath not done all this for they are a nation void of counsel neither is there anyunderstanding in them o that they were wise that they understood this that theywould consider their latter end   how should one chase athousand and two put ten thousand to flight except their rock hadsold them and the lord had shut them up   for their rock is notas our rock even our enemies themselves being judges for their vine is of the vine of sodom and of the fields ofgomorrah their grapes are grapes of gall their clusters are bitter their wine is the poison of dragons and the cruel venom ofasps is not this laid up in store with me and sealed up among mytreasures   to me belongeth vengeance and recompence their footshall slide in due time for the day of their calamity is at hand andthe things that shall come upon them make haste for the lord shall judge his people and repent himself for hisservants when he seeth that their power is gone and there is noneshut up or left and he shall say where are their gods their rock in whom theytrusted  which did eat the fat of their sacrifices and drankthe wine of their drink offerings let them rise up and help you andbe your protection see now that i even i am he and there is no god with me ikill and i make alive i wound and i heal neither is there any thatcan deliver out of my hand for i lift up my hand to heaven and say i live for ever if i whet my glittering sword and mine hand take hold onjudgment i will render vengeance to mine enemies and will rewardthem that hate me i will make mine arrows drunk with blood and my sword shalldevour flesh and that with the blood of the slain and of thecaptives from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy rejoice o ye nations with his people for he will avenge theblood of his servants and will render vengeance to his adversariesand will be merciful unto his land and to his people and moses came and spake all the words of this song in the earsof the people he and hoshea the son of nun and moses made an end of speaking all these words to all israel and he said unto them set your hearts unto all the words whichi testify among you this day which ye shall command your children toobserve to do all the words of this law for it is not a vain thing for you because it is your life andthrough this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land whither yego over jordan to possess it and the lord spake unto moses that selfsame day saying get thee up into this mountain abarim unto mount nebo which is inthe land of moab that is over against jericho and behold the land ofcanaan which i give unto the children of israel for a possession and die in the mount whither thou goest up and be gathered untothy people as aaron thy brother died in mount hor and was gatheredunto his people  because ye trespassed against me among thechildren of israel at the waters of meribahkadesh in the wildernessof zin because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children ofisrael yet thou shalt see the land before thee but thou shalt not gothither unto the land which i give the children of israel and this is the blessing wherewith moses the man of god blessedthe children of israel before his death and he said the lord came from sinai and rose up from seir untothem he shined forth from mount paran and he came with ten thousandsof saints from his right hand went a fiery law for them yea he loved the people all his saints are in thy hand andthey sat down at thy feet every one shall receive of thy words moses commanded us a law even the inheritance of thecongregation of jacob and he was king in jeshurun when the heads of the people and thetribes of israel were gathered together let reuben live and not die and let not his men be few and this is the blessing of judah and he said hear lord thevoice of judah and bring him unto his people let his hands besufficient for him and be thou an help to him from his enemies and of levi he said let thy thummim and thy urim be with thyholy one whom thou didst prove at massah and with whom thou didststrive at the waters of meribah  who said unto his father and tohis mother i have not seen him neither did he acknowledge hisbrethren nor knew his own children for they have observed thy wordand kept thy covenant they shall teach jacob thy judgments and israel thy law theyshall put incense before thee and whole burnt sacrifice upon thinealtar bless lord his substance and accept the work of his handssmite through the loins of them that rise against him and of themthat hate him that they rise not again and of benjamin he said the beloved of the lord shall dwell insafety by him and the lord shall cover him all the day long and heshall dwell between his shoulders and of joseph he said blessed of the lord be his land for theprecious things of heaven for the dew and for the deep that couchethbeneath  and for the precious fruits brought forth by the sunand for the precious things put forth by the moon  and for thechief things of the ancient mountains and for the precious things ofthe lasting hills  and for the precious things of the earth andfulness thereof and for the good will of him that dwelt in the bushlet the blessing come upon the head of joseph and upon the top of thehead of him that was separated from his brethren his glory is like the firstling of his bullock and his hornsare like the horns of unicorns with them he shall push the peopletogether to the ends of the earth and they are the ten thousands ofephraim and they are the thousands of manasseh and of zebulun he said rejoice zebulun in thy going out andissachar in thy tents they shall call the people unto the mountain there they shalloffer sacrifices of righteousness for they shall suck of theabundance of the seas and of treasures hid in the sand and of gad he said blessed be he that enlargeth gad hedwelleth as a lion and teareth the arm with the crown of the head and he provided the first part for himself because there in aportion of the lawgiver was he seated and he came with the heads ofthe people he executed the justice of the lord and his judgmentswith israel and of dan he said dan is a lions whelp he shall leap frombashan and of naphtali he said o naphtali satisfied with favour andfull with the blessing of the lord possess thou the west and thesouth and of asher he said let asher be blessed with children lethim be acceptable to his brethren and let him dip his foot in oil thy shoes shall be iron and brass and as thy days so shall thystrength be there is none like unto the god of jeshurun who rideth upon theheaven in thy help and in his excellency on the sky the eternal god is thy refuge and underneath are theeverlasting arms and he shall thrust out the enemy from before theeand shall say destroy them israel then shall dwell in safety alone the fountain of jacobshall be upon a land of corn and wine also his heavens shall dropdown dew happy art thou o israel who is like unto thee o people savedby the lord the shield of thy help and who is the sword of thyexcellency and thine enemies shall be found liars unto thee and thoushalt tread upon their high places and moses went up from the plains of moab unto the mountain ofnebo to the top of pisgah that is over against jericho and the lordshewed him all the land of gilead unto dan  and all naphtaliand the land of ephraim and manasseh and all the land of judah untothe utmost sea  and the south and the plain of the valley ofjericho the city of palm trees unto zoar and the lord said unto him this is the land which i sware untoabraham unto isaac and unto jacob saying i will give it unto thyseed i have caused thee to see it with thine eyes but thou shalt notgo over thither so moses the servant of the lord died there in the land of moabaccording to the word of the lord and he buried him in a valley in the land of moab over againstbethpeor but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day and moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died hiseye was not dim nor his natural force abated and the children of israel wept for moses in the plains of moabthirty days so the days of weeping and mourning for moses were ended and joshua the son of nun was full of the spirit of wisdom formoses had laid his hands upon him and the children of israelhearkened unto him and did as the lord commanded moses and there arose not a prophet since in israel like unto moseswhom the lord knew face to face  in all the signs and thewonders which the lord sent him to do in the land of egypt

gadites and to half the tribeof manasseh spake joshua saying  remember the word which mosesthe servant of the lord commanded you saying the lord your god hathgiven you rest and hath given you this

go view the land even jericho and they went andcame into an harlots house named rahab and lodged there and it was told the king of jericho saying behold there camemen in hither to night of the children of israel to search out thecountry and the king of jericho sent unto rahab saying bring forth themen that are come to thee which are entered into thine house forthey be come to search out all the country and the woman took the two men and hid them and said thus therecame men unto me but i wist not whence they were  and it came topass about the time of shutting of the gate when it was dark thatthe men went out whither the men went i wot not pursue after themquickly for ye shall overtake them but she had brought them up to the roof of the house and hid themwith the stalks of flax which she had laid in order upon the roof and the men pursued after them the way to jordan unto the fordsand as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out they shutthe gate and before they were laid down she came up unto them upon theroof  and she said unto the men i know that the lord hath givenyou the land and that your terror is fallen upon us and that all theinhabitants of the land faint because of you for we have heard how the lord dried up the water of the red seafor you when ye came out of egypt and what ye did unto the two kingsof the amorites that were on the other side jordan sihon and ogwhom ye utterly destroyed and as soon as we had heard these things our hearts did meltneither did there remain any more courage in any man because of youfor the lord your god he is god in heaven above and in earthbeneath now therefore i pray you swear unto me by the lord since ihave shewed you kindness that ye will also shew kindness unto myfathers house and give me a true token  and that ye will savealive my father and my mother and my brethren and my sisters andall that they have and deliver our lives from death and the men answered her our life for yours if ye utter notthis our business and it shall be when the lord hath given us theland that we will deal kindly and truly with thee then she let them down by a cord through the window for herhouse was upon the town wall and she dwelt upon the wall and she said unto them get you to the mountain lest thepursuers meet you and hide yourselves there three days until thepursuers be returned and afterward may ye go your way and the men said unto her we will be blameless of this thineoath which thou hast made us swear behold when we come into the land thou shalt bind this line ofscarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by and thoushalt bring thy father and thy mother and thy brethren and all thyfathers household home unto thee and it shall be that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thyhouse into the street his blood shall be upon his head and we willbe guiltless and whosoever shall be with thee in the house his bloodshall be on our head if any hand be upon him and if thou utter this our business then we will be quit ofthine oath which thou hast made us to swear and she said according unto your words so be it and she sentthem away and they departed and she bound the scarlet line in thewindow and they went and came unto the mountain and abode there threedays until the pursuers were returned and the pursuers sought themthroughout all the way but found them not so the two men returned and descended from the mountain andpassed over and came to joshua the son of nun and told him allthings that befell them  and they said unto joshua truly thelord hath delivered into our hands all the land for even all theinhabitants of the country do faint because of us and joshua rose early in the morning and they removed fromshittim and came to jordan he and all the children of israel andlodged there before they passed over and it came to pass after three days that the officers wentthrough the host  and they commanded the people saying when yesee the ark of the covenant of the lord your god and the priests thelevites bearing it then ye shall remove from your place and go afterit yet there shall be a space between you and it about two thousandcubits by measure come not near unto it that ye may know the way bywhich ye must go for ye have not passed this way heretofore and joshua said unto the people sanctify yourselves for tomorrow the lord will do wonders among you and joshua spake unto the priests saying take up the ark of thecovenant and pass over before the people and they took up the ark ofthe covenant and went before the people and the lord said unto joshua this day will i begin to magnifythee in the sight of all israel that they may know that as i waswith moses so i will be with thee and thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of thecovenant saying when ye are come to the brink of the water ofjordan ye shall stand still in jordan and joshua said unto the children of israel come hither and hearthe words of the lord your god and joshua said hereby ye shall know that the living god isamong you and that he will without fail drive out from before you thecanaanites and the hittites and the hivites and the perizzites andthe girgashites and the amorites and the jebusites behold the ark of the covenant of the lord of all the earthpasseth over before you into jordan now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of israelout of every tribe a man and it shall come to pass as soon as the soles of the feet ofthe priests that bear the ark of the lord the lord of all the earthshall rest in the waters of jordan that the waters of jordan shall becut off from the waters that come down from above and they shallstand upon an heap and it came to pass when the people removed from their tents topass over jordan and the priests bearing the ark of the covenantbefore the people  and as they that bare the ark were come untojordan and the feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped inthe brim of the water for jordan overfloweth all his banks all thetime of harvest  that the waters which came down from abovestood and rose up upon an heap very far from the city adam that isbeside zaretan and those that came down toward the sea of the plaineven the salt sea failed and were cut off and the people passedover right against jericho and the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the lordstood firm on dry ground in the midst of jordan and all theisraelites passed over on dry ground until all the people were passedclean over jordan and it came to pass when all the people were clean passed overjordan that the lord spake unto joshua saying  take you twelvemen out of the people out of every tribe a man  and command yethem saying take you hence out of the midst of jordan out of theplace where the priests feet stood firm twelve stones and ye shallcarry them over with you and leave them in the lodging place whereye shall lodge this night then joshua called the twelve men whom he had prepared of thechildren of israel out of every tribe a man  and joshua said untothem pass over before the ark of the lord your god into the midst ofjordan and take you up every man of you a stone upon his shoulderaccording unto the number of the tribes of the children of israel that this may be a sign among you that when your children ask theirfathers in time to come saying what mean ye by these stones  then ye shall answer them that the waters of jordan were cut offbefore the ark of the covenant of the lord when it passed overjordan the waters of jordan were cut off and these stones shall befor a memorial unto the children of israel for ever and the children of israel did so as joshua commanded and took uptwelve stones out of the midst of jordan as the lord spake untojoshua according to the number of the tribes of the children ofisrael and carried them over with them unto the place where theylodged and laid them down there and joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of jordan in theplace where the feet of the priests which bare the ark of the covenantstood and they are there unto this day for the priests which bare the ark stood in the midst of jordanuntil everything was finished that the lord commanded joshua to speakunto the people according to all that moses commanded joshua and thepeople hasted and passed over and it came to pass when all the people were clean passed overthat the ark of the lord passed over and the priests in the presenceof the people and the children of reuben and the children of gad and half thetribe of manasseh passed over armed before the children of israel asmoses spake unto them  about forty thousand prepared for warpassed over before the lord unto battle to the plains of jericho on that day the lord magnified joshua in the sight of all israeland they feared him as they feared moses all the days of his life and the lord spake unto joshua saying  command the prieststhat bear the ark of the testimony that they come up out of jordan joshua therefore commanded the priests saying come ye up out ofjordan and it came to pass when the priests that bare the ark of thecovenant of the lord were come up out of the midst of jordan and thesoles of the priests feet were lifted up unto the dry land that thewaters of jordan returned unto their place and flowed over all hisbanks as they did before and the people came up out of jordan on the tenth day of thefirst month and encamped in gilgal in the east border of jericho and those twelve stones which they took out of jordan didjoshua pitch in gilgal and he spake unto the children of israel saying when yourchildren shall ask their fathers in time to come saying what meanthese stones   then ye shall let your children know sayingisrael came over this jordan on dry land for the lord your god dried up the waters of jordan from beforeyou until ye were passed over as the lord your god did to the redsea which he dried up from before us until we were gone over that all the people of the earth might know the hand of the lord thatit is mighty that ye might fear the lord your god for ever and it came to pass when all the kings of the amorites whichwere on the side of jordan westward and all the kings of thecanaanites which were by the sea heard that the lord had dried upthe waters of jordan from before the children of israel until we werepassed over that their heart melted neither was there spirit in themany more because of the children of israel at that time the lord said unto joshua make thee sharp knivesand circumcise again the children of israel the second time and joshua made him sharp knives and circumcised the children ofisrael at the hill of the foreskins and this is the cause why joshua did circumcise all the peoplethat came out of egypt that were males even all the men of war diedin the wilderness by the way after they came out of egypt now all the people that came out were circumcised but all thepeople that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forthout of egypt them they had not circumcised for the children of israel walked forty years in the wildernesstill all the people that were men of war which came out of egyptwere consumed because they obeyed not the voice of the lord untowhom the lord sware that he would not shew them the land which thelord sware unto their fathers that he would give us a land thatfloweth with milk and honey and their children whom he raised up in their stead them joshuacircumcised for they were uncircumcised because they had notcircumcised them by the way and it came to pass when they had done circumcising all thepeople that they abode in their places in the camp till they werewhole and the lord said unto joshua this day have i rolled away thereproach of egypt from off you wherefore the name of the place iscalled gilgal unto this day and the children of israel encamped in gilgal and kept thepassover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains ofjericho and they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow afterthe passover unleavened cakes and parched corn in the selfsame day and the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of theold corn of the land neither had the children of israel manna anymore but they did eat of the fruit of the land of canaan that year and it came to pass when joshua was by jericho that he liftedup his eyes and looked and behold there stood a man over againsthim with his sword drawn in his hand and joshua went unto him andsaid unto him art thou for us or for our adversaries   and hesaid nay but as captain of the host of the lord am i now come andjoshua fell on his face to the earth and did worship and said untohim what saith my lord unto his servant   and the captain of thelords host said unto joshua loose thy shoe from off thy foot forthe place whereon thou standest is holy and joshua did so now jericho was straitly shut up because of the children ofisrael none went out and none came in and the lord said unto joshua see i have given into thine handjericho and the king thereof and the mighty men of valour and ye shall compass the city all ye men of war and go roundabout the city once thus shalt thou do six days and seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets oframs horns and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seventimes and the priests shall blow with the trumpets and it shall come to pass that when they make a long blast withthe rams horn and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet all thepeople shall shout with a great shout and the wall of the city shallfall down flat and the people shall ascend up every man straightbefore him and joshua the son of nun called the priests and said unto themtake up the ark of the covenant and let seven priests bear seventrumpets of rams horns before the ark of the lord and he said unto the people pass on and compass the city andlet him that is armed pass on before the ark of the lord and it came to pass when joshua had spoken unto the people thatthe seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams horns passed onbefore the lord and blew with the trumpets and the ark of thecovenant of the lord followed them and the armed men went before the priests that blew with thetrumpets and the rereward came after the ark the priests going onand blowing with the trumpets and joshua had commanded the people saying ye shall not shoutnor make any noise with your voice neither shall any word proceed outof your mouth until the day i bid you shout then shall ye shout so the ark of the lord compassed the city going about it onceand they came into the camp and lodged in the camp and joshua rose early in the morning and the priests took up theark of the lord and seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams horns beforethe ark of the lord went on continually and blew with the trumpetsand the armed men went before them but the rereward came after theark of the lord the priests going on and blowing with the trumpets and the second day they compassed the city once and returnedinto the camp so they did six days and it came to pass on the seventh day that they rose earlyabout the dawning of the day and compassed the city after the samemanner seven times only on that day they compassed the city seventimes and it came to pass at the seventh time when the priests blewwith the trumpets joshua said unto the people shout for the lordhath given you the city and the city shall be accursed even it and all that aretherein to the lord only rahab the harlot shall live she and allthat are with her in the house because she hid the messengers that wesent and ye in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing lestye make yourselves accursed when ye take of the accursed thing andmake the camp of israel a curse and trouble it but all the silver and gold and vessels of brass and iron areconsecrated unto the lord they shall come into the treasury of thelord so the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpetsand it came to pass when the people heard the sound of the trumpetand the people shouted with a great shout that the wall fell downflat so that the people went up into the city every man straightbefore him and they took the city and they utterly destroyed all that was in the city both man andwoman young and old and ox and sheep and ass with the edge of thesword but joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out thecountry go into the harlots house and bring out thence the womanand all that she hath as ye sware unto her and the young men that were spies went in and brought out rahaband her father and her mother and her brethren and all that shehad and they brought out all her kindred and left them without thecamp of israel and they burnt the city with fire and all that was therein onlythe silver and the gold and the vessels of brass and of iron theyput into the treasury of the house of the lord and joshua saved rahab the harlot alive and her fathershousehold and all that she had and she dwelleth in israel even untothis day because she hid the messengers which joshua sent to spy outjericho and joshua adjured them at that time saying cursed be the manbefore the lord that riseth up and buildeth this city jericho heshall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn and in his youngestson shall he set up the gates of it so the lord was with joshua and his fame was noised throughoutall the country but the children of israel committed a trespass in the accursedthing for achan the son of carmi the son of zabdi the son ofzerah of the tribe of judah took of the accursed thing and theanger of the lord was kindled against the children of israel and joshua sent men from jericho to ai which is beside bethavenon the east of bethel and spake unto them saying go up and view thecountryand the men went up and viewed ai and they returned to joshua and said unto him let not all thepeople go up but let about two or three thousand men go up and smiteai and make not all the people to labour thither for they are butfew so there went up thither of the people about three thousand menand they fled before the men of ai and the men of ai smote of them about thirty and six men for theychased them from before the gate even unto shebarim and smote them inthe going down wherefore the hearts of the people melted and becameas water and joshua rent his clothes and fell to the earth upon his facebefore the ark of the lord until the eventide he and the elders ofisrael and put dust upon their heads and joshua said alas o lord god wherefore hast thou at allbrought this people over jordan to deliver us into the hand of theamorites to destroy us would to god we had been content and dwelton the other side jordan   o lord what shall i say when israelturneth their backs before their enemies   for the canaanites andall the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it and shall environ usround and cut off our name from the earth and what wilt thou do untothy great name   and the lord said unto joshua get thee upwherefore liest thou thus upon thy face   israel hath sinned andthey have also transgressed my covenant which i commanded them forthey have even taken of the accursed thing and have also stolen anddissembled also and they have put it even among their own stuff therefore the children of israel could not stand before theirenemies but turned their backs before their enemies because theywere accursed neither will i be with you any more except ye destroythe accursed from among you up sanctify the people and say sanctify yourselves against tomorrow for thus saith the lord god of israel there is an accursedthing in the midst of thee o israel thou canst not stand beforethine enemies until ye take away the accursed thing from among you in the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to yourtribes and it shall be that the tribe which the lord taketh shallcome according to the families thereof and the family which the lordshall take shall come by households and the household which the lordshall take shall come man by man and it shall be that he that is taken with the accursed thingshall be burnt with fire he and all that he hath because he hathtransgressed the covenant of the lord and because he hath wroughtfolly in israel so joshua rose up early in the morning and brought israel bytheir tribes and the tribe of judah was taken  and he broughtthe family of judah and he took the family of the zarhites and hebrought the family of the zarhites man by man and zabdi was taken and he brought his household man by man and achan the son ofcarmi the son of zabdi the son of zerah of the tribe of judah wastaken and joshua said unto achan my son give i pray thee glory tothe lord god of israel and make confession unto him and tell me nowwhat thou hast done hide it not from me and achan answered joshua and said indeed i have sinned againstthe lord god of israel and thus and thus have i done  when i sawamong the spoils a goodly babylonish garment and two hundred shekelsof silver and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight then i covetedthem and took them and behold they are hid in the earth in themidst of my tent and the silver under it so joshua sent messengers and they ran unto the tent andbehold it was hid in his tent and the silver under it and they took them out of the midst of the tent and brought themunto joshua and unto all the children of israel and laid them outbefore the lord and joshua and all israel with him took achan the son of zerahand the silver and the garment and the wedge of gold and his sonsand his daughters and his oxen and his asses and his sheep and histent and all that he had and they brought them unto the valley ofachor and joshua said why hast thou troubled us the lord shalltrouble thee this day and all israel stoned him with stones andburned them with fire after they had stoned them with stones and they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day sothe lord turned from the fierceness of his anger wherefore the nameof that place was called the valley of achor unto this day and the lord said unto joshua fear not neither be thou dismayedtake all the people of war with thee and arise go up to ai see ihave given into thy hand the king of ai and his people and his cityand his land  and thou shalt do to ai and her king as thou didstunto jericho and her king only the spoil thereof and the cattlethereof shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves lay thee an ambushfor the city behind it so joshua arose and all the people of war to go up against aiand joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour and sentthem away by night and he commanded them saying behold ye shall lie in waitagainst the city even behind the city go not very far from the citybut be ye all ready  and i and all the people that are with mewill approach unto the city and it shall come to pass when they comeout against us as at the first that we will flee before them for they will come out after us till we have drawn them from thecity for they will say they flee before us as at the firsttherefore we will flee before them then ye shall rise up from the ambush and seize upon the cityfor the lord your god will deliver it into your hand and it shall be when ye have taken the city that ye shall setthe city on fire according to the commandment of the lord shall yedo see i have commanded you joshua therefore sent them forth and they went to lie in ambushand abode between bethel and ai on the west side of ai but joshualodged that night among the people and joshua rose up early in the morning and numbered the peopleand went up he and the elders of israel before the people to ai and all the people even the people of war that were with himwent up and drew nigh and came before the city and pitched on thenorth side of ai now there was a valley between them and ai and he took about five thousand men and set them to lie inambush between bethel and ai on the west side of the city and when they had set the people even all the host that was onthe north of the city and their liers in wait on the west of thecity joshua went that night into the midst of the valley and it came to pass when the king of ai saw it that they hastedand rose up early and the men of the city went out against israel tobattle he and all his people at a time appointed before the plainbut he wist not that there were liers in ambush against him behind thecity and joshua and all israel made as if they were beaten beforethem and fled by the way of the wilderness and all the people that were in ai were called together to pursueafter them and they pursued after joshua and were drawn away fromthe city and there was not a man left in ai or bethel that went not outafter israel and they left the city open and pursued after israel and the lord said unto joshua stretch out the spear that is inthy hand toward ai for i will give it into thine hand and joshuastretched out the spear that he had in his hand toward the city and the ambush arose quickly out of their place and they ran assoon as he had stretched out his hand and they entered into the cityand took it and hasted and set the city on fire and when the men of ai looked behind them they saw and beholdthe smoke of the city ascended up to heaven and they had no power toflee this way or that way and the people that fled to the wildernessturned back upon the pursuers and when joshua and all israel saw that the ambush had taken thecity and that the smoke of the city ascended then they turned againand slew the men of ai and the other issued out of the city against them so they werein the midst of israel some on this side and some on that side andthey smote them so that they let none of them remain or escape and the king of ai they took alive and brought him to joshua and it came to pass when israel had made an end of slaying allthe inhabitants of ai in the field in the wilderness wherein theychased them and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sworduntil they were consumed that all the israelites returned unto aiand smote it with the edge of the sword and so it was that all that fell that day both of men andwomen were twelve thousand even all the men of ai for joshua drew not his hand back wherewith he stretched out thespear until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of ai only the cattle and the spoil of that city israel took for a preyunto themselves according unto the word of the lord which hecommanded joshua and joshua burnt ai and made it an heap for ever even adesolation unto this day and the king of ai he hanged on a tree until eventide and assoon as the sun was down joshua commanded that they should take hiscarcase down from the tree and cast it at the entering of the gate ofthe city and raise thereon a great heap of stones that remainethunto this day then joshua built an altar unto the lord god of israel in mountebal  as moses the servant of the lord commanded the children ofisrael as it is written in the book of the law of moses an altar ofwhole stones over which no man hath lift up any iron and theyoffered thereon burnt offerings unto the lord and sacrificed peaceofferings and he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of moseswhich he wrote in the presence of the children of israel and all israel and their elders and officers and their judgesstood on this side the ark and on that side before the priests thelevites which bare the ark of the covenant of the lord as well thestranger as he that was born among them half of them over againstmount gerizim and half of them over against mount ebal as moses theservant of the lord had commanded before that they should bless thepeople of israel and afterward he read all the words of the law the blessings andcursings according to all that is written in the book of the law there was not a word of all that moses commanded which joshuaread not before all the congregation of israel with the women andthe little ones and the strangers that were conversant among them and it came to pass when all the kings which were on this sidejordan in the hills and in the valleys and in all the coasts of thegreat sea over against lebanon the hittite and the amorite thecanaanite the perizzite the hivite and the jebusite heard thereof that they gathered themselves together to fight with joshua andwith israel with one accord and when the inhabitants of gibeon heard what joshua had done untojericho and to ai  they did work wilily and went and made as ifthey had been ambassadors and took old sacks upon their asses andwine bottles old and rent and bound up  and old shoes andclouted upon their feet and old garments upon them and all the breadof their provision was dry and mouldy and they went to joshua unto the camp at gilgal and said untohim and to the men of israel we be come from a far country nowtherefore make ye a league with us and the men of israel said unto the hivites peradventure ye dwellamong us and how shall we make a league with you   and they saidunto joshua we are thy servants and joshua said unto them who areye and from whence come ye   and they said unto him from a veryfar country thy servants are come because of the name of the lord thygod for we have heard the fame of him and all that he did in egypt and all that he did to the two kings of the amorites that werebeyond jordan to sihon king of heshbon and to og king of bashanwhich was at ashtaroth wherefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spaketo us saying take victuals with you for the journey and go to meetthem and say unto them we are your servants therefore now make ye aleague with us this our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses onthe day we came forth to go unto you but now behold it is dry andit is mouldy  and these bottles of wine which we filled werenew and behold they be rent and these our garments and our shoesare become old by reason of the very long journey and the men took of their victuals and asked not counsel at themouth of the lord and joshua made peace with them and made a league with them tolet them live and the princes of the congregation sware unto them and it came to pass at the end of three days after they had madea league with them that they heard that they were their neighboursand that they dwelt among them and the children of israel journeyed and came unto their citieson the third day now their cities were gibeon and chephirah andbeeroth and kirjathjearim and the children of israel smote them not because the princes ofthe congregation had sworn unto them by the lord god of israel andall the congregation murmured against the princes but all the princes said unto all the congregation we have swornunto them by the lord god of israel now therefore we may not touchthem this we will do to them we will even let them live lest wrathbe upon us because of the oath which we sware unto them and the princes said unto them let them live but let them behewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation as theprinces had promised them and joshua called for them and he spake unto them sayingwherefore have ye beguiled us saying we are very far from you whenye dwell among us   now therefore ye are cursed and there shallnone of you be freed from being bondmen and hewers of wood anddrawers of water for the house of my god and they answered joshua and said because it was certainly toldthy servants how that the lord thy god commanded his servant moses togive you all the land and to destroy all the inhabitants of the landfrom before you therefore we were sore afraid of our lives because ofyou and have done this thing and now behold we are in thine hand as it seemeth good andright unto thee to do unto us do and so did he unto them and delivered them out of the hand ofthe children of israel that they slew them not and joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of waterfor the congregation and for the altar of the lord even unto thisday in the place which he should choose now it came to pass when adonizedec king of jerusalem had heardhow joshua had taken ai and had utterly destroyed it as he had doneto jericho and her king so he had done to ai and her king and howthe inhabitants of gibeon had made peace with israel and were amongthem  that they feared greatly because gibeon was a great cityas one of the royal cities and because it was greater than ai andall the men thereof were mighty wherefore adonizedec king of jerusalem sent unto hoham king ofhebron and unto piram king of jarmuth and unto japhia king oflachish and unto debir king of eglon saying  come up unto meand help me that we may smite gibeon for it hath made peace withjoshua and with the children of israel therefore the five kings of the amorites the king of jerusalemthe king of hebron the king of jarmuth the king of lachish the kingof eglon gathered themselves together and went up they and alltheir hosts and encamped before gibeon and made war against it and the men of gibeon sent unto joshua to the camp to gilgalsaying slack not thy hand from thy servants come up to us quicklyand save us and help us for all the kings of the amorites that dwellin the mountains are gathered together against us so joshua ascended from gilgal he and all the people of warwith him and all the mighty men of valour and the lord said unto joshua fear them not for i havedelivered them into thine hand there shall not a man of them standbefore thee joshua therefore came unto them suddenly and went up from gilgalall night and the lord discomfited them before israel and slew them witha great slaughter at gibeon and chased them along the way that goethup to bethhoron and smote them to azekah and unto makkedah and it came to pass as they fled from before israel and werein the going down to bethhoron that the lord cast down great stonesfrom heaven upon them unto azekah and they died they were more whichdied with hailstones than they whom the children of israel slew withthe sword then spake joshua to the lord in the day when the lord deliveredup the amorites before the children of israel and he said in thesight of israel sun stand thou still upon gibeon and thou moon inthe valley of ajalon and the sun stood still and the moon stayed until the peoplehad avenged themselves upon their enemies is not this written in thebook of jasher so the sun stood still in the midst of heaven andhasted not to go down about a whole day and there was no day like that before it or after it that thelord hearkened unto the voice of a man for the lord fought forisrael and joshua returned and all israel with him unto the camp togilgal but these five kings fled and hid themselves in a cave atmakkedah and it was told joshua saying the five kings are found hid ina cave at makkedah and joshua said roll great stones upon the mouth of the caveand set men by it for to keep them  and stay ye not but pursueafter your enemies and smite the hindmost of them suffer them not toenter into their cities for the lord your god hath delivered theminto your hand and it came to pass when joshua and the children of israel hadmade an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter till theywere consumed that the rest which remained of them entered intofenced cities and all the people returned to the camp to joshua at makkedah inpeace none moved his tongue against any of the children of israel then said joshua open the mouth of the cave and bring outthose five kings unto me out of the cave and they did so and brought forth those five kings unto him outof the cave the king of jerusalem the king of hebron the king ofjarmuth the king of lachish and the king of eglon and it came to pass when they brought out those kings untojoshua that joshua called for all the men of israel and said untothe captains of the men of war which went with him come near putyour feet upon the necks of these kings and they came near and puttheir feet upon the necks of them and joshua said unto them fear not nor be dismayed be strongand of good courage for thus shall the lord do to all your enemiesagainst whom ye fight and afterward joshua smote them and slew them and hanged themon five trees and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening and it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sunthat joshua commanded and they took them down off the trees and castthem into the cave wherein they had been hid and laid great stones inthe caves mouth which remain until this very day and that day joshua took makkedah and smote it with the edge ofthe sword and the king thereof he utterly destroyed them and allthe souls that were therein he let none remain and he did to theking of makkedah as he did unto the king of jericho then joshua passed from makkedah and all israel with him untolibnah and fought against libnah  and the lord delivered italso and the king thereof into the hand of israel and he smote itwith the edge of the sword and all the souls that were therein helet none remain in it but did unto the king thereof as he did untothe king of jericho and joshua passed from libnah and all israel with him untolachish and encamped against it and fought against it  and thelord delivered lachish into the hand of israel which took it on thesecond day and smote it with the edge of the sword and all the soulsthat were therein according to all that he had done to libnah then horam king of gezer came up to help lachish and joshuasmote him and his people until he had left him none remaining and from lachish joshua passed unto eglon and all israel withhim and they encamped against it and fought against it  andthey took it on that day and smote it with the edge of the sword andall the souls that were therein he utterly destroyed that dayaccording to all that he had done to lachish and joshua went up from eglon and all israel with him untohebron and they fought against it  and they took it and smoteit with the edge of the sword and the king thereof and all thecities thereof and all the souls that were therein he left noneremaining according to all that he had done to eglon but destroyedit utterly and all the souls that were therein and joshua returned and all israel with him to debir andfought against it  and he took it and the king thereof and allthe cities thereof and they smote them with the edge of the swordand utterly destroyed all the souls that were therein he left noneremaining as he had done to hebron so he did to debir and to theking thereof as he had done also to libnah and to her king so joshua smote all the country of the hills and of the southand of the vale and of the springs and all their kings he left noneremaining but utterly destroyed all that breathed as the lord god ofisrael commanded and joshua smote them from kadeshbarnea even unto gaza and allthe country of goshen even unto gibeon and all these kings and their land did joshua take at one timebecause the lord god of israel fought for israel and joshua returned and all israel with him unto the camp togilgal and it came to pass when jabin king of hazor had heard thosethings that he sent to jobab king of madon and to the king ofshimron and to the king of achshaph  and to the kings that wereon the north of the mountains and of the plains south of chinnerothand in the valley and in the borders of dor on the west  and tothe canaanite on the east and on the west and to the amorite and thehittite and the perizzite and the jebusite in the mountains and tothe hivite under hermon in the land of mizpeh and they went out they and all their hosts with them muchpeople even as the sand that is upon the sea shore in multitude withhorses and chariots very many and when all these kings were met together they came and pitchedtogether at the waters of merom to fight against israel and the lord said unto joshua be not afraid because of them forto morrow about this time will i deliver them up all slain beforeisrael thou shalt hough their horses and burn their chariots withfire so joshua came and all the people of war with him against themby the waters of merom suddenly and they fell upon them and the lord delivered them into the hand of israel who smotethem and chased them unto great zidon and unto misrephothmaim andunto the valley of mizpeh eastward and they smote them until theyleft them none remaining and joshua did unto them as the lord bade him he houghed theirhorses and burnt their chariots with fire and joshua at that time turned back and took hazor and smotethe king thereof with the sword for hazor beforetime was the head ofall those kingdoms and they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge ofthe sword utterly destroying them there was not any left to breatheand he burnt hazor with fire and all the cities of those kings and all the kings of themdid joshua take and smote them with the edge of the sword and heutterly destroyed them as moses the servant of the lord commanded but as for the cities that stood still in their strength israelburned none of them save hazor only that did joshua burn and all the spoil of these cities and the cattle the childrenof israel took for a prey unto themselves but every man they smotewith the edge of the sword until they had destroyed them neitherleft they any to breathe as the lord commanded moses his servant so did moses commandjoshua and so did joshua he left nothing undone of all that the lordcommanded moses so joshua took all that land the hills and all the southcountry and all the land of goshen and the valley and the plainand the mountain of israel and the valley of the same  evenfrom the mount halak that goeth up to seir even unto baalgad in thevalley of lebanon under mount hermon and all their kings he took andsmote them and slew them joshua made war a long time with all those kings there was not a city that made peace with the children ofisrael save the hivites the inhabitants of gibeon all other theytook in battle for it was of the lord to harden their hearts that they shouldcome against israel in battle that he might destroy them utterly andthat they might have no favour but that he might destroy them as thelord commanded moses and at that time came joshua and cut off the anakims from themountains from hebron from debir from anab and from all themountains of judah and from all the mountains of israel joshuadestroyed them utterly with their cities there was none of the anakims left in the land of the childrenof israel only in gaza in gath and in ashdod there remained so joshua

when moses the servant of the lord sent mefrom kadeshbarnea to espy out the land and i brought him word againas it was in mine heart nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart ofthe people melt but i wholly followed the lord my god and moses sware on that day saying surely the land whereon thyfeet have trodden shall be thine inheritance and thy childrens forever because thou hast wholly followed the lord my god and now behold the lord hath kept me alive as he said theseforty and five years even since the lord spake this word unto moseswhile the children of israel wandered in the wilderness and now loi am this day fourscore and five years old as yet i am as strong this day as i was in the day that mosessent me as my strength was then even so is my strength now for warboth to go out and to come in now therefore give me this mountain whereof the lord spake inthat day for thou heardest in that day how the anakims were thereand that the cities were great and fenced if so be the lord will bewith me then i shall be able to drive them out as the lord said and joshua blessed him and gave unto caleb the son of jephunnehhebron for an inheritance hebron therefore became the

so the children of joseph manasseh and ephraim took theirinheritance and the border of the children of ephraim according to theirfamilies was thus even the border of their inheritance on the eastside was atarothaddar unto bethhoron the upper  and the borderwent out toward the sea to michmethah on the north side and theborder went about eastward unto taanathshiloh and passed by it on theeast to

therest of manassehs sons had the land of gilead and the coast of manasseh was from asher to michmethah thatlieth before shechem and the border went along on the right hand untothe inhabitants of

canaanites to tribute but did not utterlydrive them out and the children of joseph spake unto joshua saying why hastthou given me but one lot and one portion to inherit seeing i am agreat people forasmuch as the lord hath blessed me hitherto  and joshua answered them if thou be a great people then get thee upto the wood country and cut down for thyself there in the land of theperizzites and of the giants if mount ephraim be too narrow for thee and the children of joseph said the hill is not enough for usand all the canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley havechariots of iron both they who are of bethshean and her towns andthey who are of the valley of jezreel and joshua spake unto the house of joseph even to ephraim andto manasseh saying thou art a great people and hast great powerthou shalt not have one lot only  but the mountain shall bethine for it is a wood and thou shalt cut it down and the outgoingsof it shall be thine for thou shalt drive out the canaanites thoughthey have iron chariots and though they be strong and the whole congregation of the children of israel assembledtogether at shiloh and set up the tabernacle of the congregationthere and the land

their enemies into theirhand there failed not ought of any good thing which the lord hadspoken unto the house of israel all came to pass then joshua called the reubenites and the gadites and the halftribe of manasseh  and said unto them ye have kept all thatmoses the servant of the lord commanded you and have obeyed my voicein all that i commanded you  ye have not left your brethren thesemany days unto this day but have kept the charge of the commandmentof the lord your god and now the lord your god hath given rest unto your brethren ashe promised them therefore now return ye and get you unto yourtents and unto the land of your possession which moses the servantof the lord gave you on the other side jordan but take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law whichmoses the servant of the lord charged you to love the lord your godand to walk in all his ways and to keep his commandments and tocleave unto him and to serve him with all your heart and with allyour soul so joshua blessed them and sent them away and they went untotheir tents now to the one half of the tribe of manasseh moses had givenpossession in bashan but unto the other half thereof gave joshuaamong their brethren on this side jordan westward and when joshuasent them away also unto their tents then he blessed them  andhe spake unto them saying return with much riches unto your tentsand with very much cattle with silver and with gold and with brassand with iron and with very much raiment divide the spoil of yourenemies with your brethren and the children of reuben and the children of gad and the halftribe of manasseh returned and departed from the children of israelout of shiloh which is in the land of canaan to go unto the countryof gilead to the land of their possession whereof they werepossessed according to the word of the lord by the hand of moses and when they came unto the borders of jordan that are in theland of canaan the children of reuben and the children of gad and thehalf tribe of manasseh built there an altar by jordan a great altarto see to and the children of israel heard say behold the children ofreuben and the children of gad and the half tribe of manasseh havebuilt an altar over against the land of canaan in the borders ofjordan at the passage of the children of israel and when the children of israel heard of it the wholecongregation of the children of israel gathered themselves together atshiloh to go up to war against them and the children of israel sent unto the children of reuben andto the children of gad and to the half tribe of manasseh into theland of gilead phinehas the son of eleazar the priest  and withhim ten princes of each chief house a prince throughout all thetribes of israel and each one was an head of the house of theirfathers among the thousands of israel and they came unto the children of reuben and to the childrenof gad and to the half tribe of manasseh unto the land of gileadand they spake with them saying  thus saith the wholecongregation of the lord what trespass is this that ye have committedagainst the god of israel to turn away this day from following thelord in that ye have builded you an altar that ye might rebel thisday against the lord   is the iniquity of peor too little forus from which we are not cleansed until this day although there wasa plague in the congregation of the lord  but that ye must turnaway this day from following the lord and it will be seeing ye rebelto day against the lord that to morrow he will be wroth with thewhole congregation of israel notwithstanding if the land of your possession be unclean thenpass ye over unto the land of the possession of the lord wherein thelords tabernacle dwelleth and take possession among us but rebelnot against the lord nor rebel against us in building you an altarbeside the altar of the lord our god did not achan the son of zerah commit a trespass in the accursedthing and wrath fell on all the congregation of israel and that manperished not alone in his iniquity then the children of reuben and the children of gad and the halftribe of manasseh answered and said unto the heads of the thousandsof israel  the lord god of gods the lord god of gods heknoweth and israel he shall know if it be in rebellion or if intransgression against the lord save us not this day  that wehave built us an altar to turn from following the lord or if to offerthereon burnt offering or meat offering or if to offer peaceofferings thereon let the lord himself require it  and if wehave not rather done it for fear of this thing saying in time tocome your children might speak unto our children saying what have yeto do with the lord god of israel   for the lord hath madejordan a border between us and you ye children of reuben and childrenof gad ye have no part in the lord so shall your children make ourchildren cease from fearing the lord therefore we said let us now prepare to build us an altar notfor burnt offering nor for sacrifice  but that it may be awitness between us and you and our generations after us that wemight do the service of the lord before him with our burnt offeringsand with our sacrifices and with our peace offerings that yourchildren may not say to our children in time to come ye have no partin the lord therefore said we that it shall be when they should so say tous or to our generations in time to come that we may say againbehold the pattern of the altar of the lord which our fathers madenot for burnt offerings nor for sacrifices but it is a witnessbetween us and you god forbid that we should rebel against the lord and turn thisday from following the lord to build an altar for burnt offeringsfor meat offerings or for sacrifices beside the altar of the lordour god that is before his tabernacle and when phinehas the priest and the princes of thecongregation and heads of the thousands of israel which were with himheard the words that the children of reuben and the children of gadand the children of manasseh spake it pleased them and phinehas the son of eleazar the priest said unto thechildren of reuben and to the children of gad and to the children ofmanasseh this day we perceive that the lord is among us because yehave not committed this trespass against the lord now ye havedelivered the children of israel out of the hand of the lord and phinehas the son of eleazar the priest and the princesreturned from the children of reuben and from the children of gadout of the land of gilead unto the land of canaan to the children ofisrael and brought them word again and the thing pleased the children of israel and the childrenof israel blessed god and did not intend to go up against them inbattle to destroy the land wherein the children of reuben and gaddwelt and the children of reuben and the children of gad called thealtar ed for it shall be a witness between us that the lord is god and it came to pass a long time after that the lord had givenrest unto israel from all their enemies round about that joshua waxedold and stricken in age and joshua called for all israel and for their elders and fortheir heads and for their judges and for their officers and saidunto them i am old and stricken in age  and ye have seen allthat the lord your god hath done unto all these nations because ofyou for the lord your god is he that hath fought for you behold i have divided unto you by lot these nations that remainto be an inheritance for your tribes from jordan with all thenations that i have cut off even unto the great sea westward and the lord your god he shall expel them from before you anddrive them from out of your sight and ye shall possess their land asthe lord your god hath promised unto you be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that iswritten in the book of the law of moses that ye turn not asidetherefrom to the right hand or to the left  that ye come notamong these nations these that remain among you neither make mentionof the name of their gods nor cause to swear by them neither servethem nor bow yourselves unto them  but cleave unto the lord yourgod as ye have done unto this day for the lord hath driven out from before you great nations andstrong but as for you no man hath been able to stand before you untothis day one man of you shall chase a thousand for the lord your god heit is that fighteth for you as he hath promised you take good heed therefore unto yourselves that ye love the lordyour god else if ye do in any wise go back and cleave unto the remnantof these nations even these that remain among you and shall makemarriages with them and go in unto them and they to you  knowfor a certainty that the lord your god will no more drive out any ofthese nations from before you but they shall be snares and traps untoyou and scourges in your sides and thorns in your eyes until yeperish from off this good land which the lord your god hath given you and behold this day i am going the way of all the earth andye know in all your hearts and in all your souls that not one thinghath failed of all the good things which the lord your god spakeconcerning you all are come to pass unto you and not one thing hathfailed thereof therefore it shall come to pass that as all good things arecome upon you which the lord your god promised you so shall the lordbring upon you all evil things until he have destroyed you from offthis good land which the lord your god hath given you when ye have transgressed the covenant of the lord your godwhich he commanded you and have gone and served other gods and bowedyourselves to them then shall the anger of the lord be kindledagainst you and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land whichhe hath given unto you and joshua gathered all the tribes of israel to shechem andcalled for the elders of israel and for their heads and for theirjudges and for their officers and they presented themselves beforegod and joshua said unto all the people thus saith the lord god ofisrael your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in old timeeven terah the father of abraham and the father of nachor and theyserved other gods and i took your father abraham from the other side of the floodand led him throughout all the land of canaan and multiplied hisseed and gave him isaac and i gave unto isaac jacob and esau and i gave unto esau mountseir to possess it but jacob and his children went down into egypt i sent moses also and aaron and i plagued egypt according tothat which i did among them and afterward i brought you out and i brought your fathers out of egypt and ye came unto thesea and the egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots andhorsemen unto the red sea and when they cried unto the lord he put darkness between youand the egyptians and brought the sea upon them and covered themand your eyes have seen what i have done in egypt and ye dwelt in thewilderness a long season and i brought you into the land of the amorites which dwelt onthe other side jordan and they fought with you and i gave them intoyour hand that ye might possess their land and i destroyed them frombefore you then balak the son of zippor king of moab arose and warredagainst israel and sent and called balaam the son of beor to curseyou  but i would not hearken unto balaam therefore he blessedyou still so i delivered you out of his hand and you went over jordan and came unto jericho and the men ofjericho fought against you the amorites and the perizzites and thecanaanites and the hittites and the girgashites the hivites andthe jebusites and i delivered them into your hand and i sent the hornet before you which drave them out frombefore you even the two kings of the amorites but not with thysword nor with thy bow and i have given you a land for which ye did not labour andcities which ye built not and ye dwell in them of the vineyards andoliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat now therefore fear the lord and serve him in sincerity and intruth and put away the gods which your fathers served on the otherside of the flood and in egypt and serve ye the lord and if it seem evil unto you to serve the lord choose you thisday whom ye will serve whether the gods which your fathers servedthat were on the other side of the flood or the gods of the amoritesin whose land ye dwell but as for me and my house we will serve thelord and the people answered and said god forbid that we shouldforsake the lord to serve other gods  for the lord our god heit is that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of egyptfrom the house of bondage and which did those great signs in oursight and preserved us in all the way wherein we went and among allthe people through whom we passed  and the lord drave out frombefore us all the people even the amorites which dwelt in the landtherefore will we also serve the lord for he is our god and joshua said unto the people ye cannot serve the lord forhe is an holy god he is a jealous god he will not forgive yourtransgressions nor your sins if ye forsake the lord and serve strange gods then he willturn and do you hurt and consume you after that he hath done yougood and the people said unto joshua nay but we will serve thelord and joshua said unto the people ye are witnesses againstyourselves that ye have chosen you the lord to serve him and theysaid we are witnesses now therefore put away said he the strange gods which areamong you and incline your heart unto the lord god of israel and the people said unto joshua the lord our god will we serveand his voice will we obey so joshua made a covenant with the people that day and set thema statute and an ordinance in shechem and joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of god andtook a great stone and set it up there under an oak that was by thesanctuary of the lord and joshua said unto all the people behold this stone shall bea witness unto us for it hath heard all the words of the lord whichhe spake unto us it shall be therefore a witness unto you lest yedeny your god so joshua let the people depart every man unto his inheritance and it came to pass after these things that joshua the son ofnun the servant of the lord died being an hundred and ten yearsold and they buried him in the border of his inheritance intimnathserah which is in mount ephraim on the north side of the hillof gaash and israel served the lord all the days of joshua and all thedays of the elders that overlived joshua and which had known all theworks of the lord that he had done for israel and the bones of joseph which the children of israel brought upout of egypt buried they in shechem in a parcel of ground whichjacob bought of the sons of hamor the father of shechem for an hundredpieces of silver and it became the inheritance of the children ofjoseph and eleazar the son of aaron died and they buried him in a hillthat pertained to phinehas his son which was given him in mountephraimthe book of judges now after the death of joshua it came to pass that the childrenof israel asked the lord saying who shall go up for us against thecanaanites first to fight against them   and the lord said judahshall go up behold i have delivered the land into his hand and judah said unto simeon his brother come up with me into mylot that we may fight against the canaanites and i likewise will gowith thee into thy lot so simeon went with him and judah went up and the lord delivered the canaanites and theperizzites into their hand and they slew of them in bezek tenthousand men and they found adonibezek in bezek and they fought against himand they slew the canaanites and the perizzites but adonibezek fled and they pursued after him and caught himand cut off his thumbs and his great toes and adonibezek said threescore and ten kings having their thumbsand their great toes cut off gathered their meat under my table as ihave done so god hath requited me and they brought him to jerusalemand there he died now the children of judah had fought against jerusalem and hadtaken it and smitten it with the edge of the sword and set the cityon fire and afterward the children of judah went down to fight against thecanaanites that dwelt in the mountain and in the south and in thevalley and judah went against the canaanites that dwelt in hebron nowthe name of hebron before was kirjatharba and they slew sheshai andahiman and talmai and from thence he went against the inhabitants of debir and thename of debir before was kirjathsepher  and caleb said he thatsmiteth kirjathsepher and taketh it to him will i give achsah mydaughter to wife and othniel the son of kenaz calebs younger brother took itand he gave him achsah his daughter to wife and it came to pass when she came to him that she moved him toask of her father a field and she lighted from off her ass and calebsaid unto her what wilt thou   and she said unto him give me ablessing for thou hast given me a south land give me also springs ofwater and caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springs and the children of the kenite moses father in law went up outof the city of palm trees with the children of judah into thewilderness of judah which lieth in the south of arad and they wentand dwelt among the people and judah went with simeon his brother and they slew thecanaanites that inhabited zephath and utterly destroyed it and thename of the city was called hormah also judah took gaza with the coast thereof and askelon with thecoast thereof and ekron with the coast thereof and the lord was with judah and he drave out the inhabitants ofthe mountain but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valleybecause they had chariots of iron and they gave hebron unto caleb as moses said and he expelledthence the three sons of anak and the children of benjamin did not drive out the jebusites thatinhabited jerusalem but the jebusites dwell with the children ofbenjamin in jerusalem unto this day and the house of joseph they also went up against bethel andthe lord was with them and the house of joseph sent to descry bethel now the name ofthe city before was luz   and the spies saw a man come forth outof the city and they said unto him shew us we pray thee theentrance into the city and we will shew thee mercy and when he shewed them the entrance into the city they smotethe city with the edge of the sword but they let go the man and allhis family and the man went into the land of the hittites and built a cityand called the name thereof luz which is the name thereof unto thisday neither did manasseh drive out the inhabitants of bethshean andher towns nor taanach and her towns nor the inhabitants of dor andher towns nor the inhabitants of ibleam and her towns nor theinhabitants of megiddo and her towns but the canaanites would dwellin that land and it came to pass when israel was strong that they put thecanaanites to tribute and did not utterly drive them out neither did ephraim drive out the canaanites that dwelt in gezerbut the canaanites dwelt in gezer among them neither did zebulun drive out the inhabitants of kitron nor theinhabitants of nahalol but the canaanites dwelt among them andbecame tributaries neither did asher drive out the inhabitants of accho nor theinhabitants of zidon nor of ahlab nor of achzib nor of helbah norof aphik nor of rehob  but the asherites dwelt among thecanaanites the inhabitants of the land for they did not drive themout neither did naphtali drive out the inhabitants of bethshemeshnor the inhabitants of bethanath but he dwelt among the canaanitesthe inhabitants of the land nevertheless the inhabitants ofbethshemesh and of bethanath became tributaries unto them and the amorites forced the children of dan into the mountainfor they would not suffer them to come down to the valley  butthe amorites would dwell in mount heres in aijalon and in shaalbimyet the hand of the house of joseph prevailed so that they becametributaries and the coast of the amorites was from the going up to akrabbimfrom the rock and upward and an angel of the lord came up from gilgal to bochim and saidi made you to go up out of egypt and have brought you unto the landwhich i sware unto your fathers and i said i will never break mycovenant with you and ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land yeshall throw down their altars but ye have not obeyed my voice whyhave ye done this   wherefore i also said i will not drive themout from before you but they shall be as thorns in your sides andtheir gods shall be a snare unto you and it came to pass when the angel of the lord spake these wordsunto all the children of israel that the people lifted up theirvoice and wept and they called the name of that place bochim and they sacrificedthere unto the lord and when joshua had let the people go the children of israel wentevery man unto his inheritance to possess the land and the people served the lord all the days of joshua and all thedays of the elders that outlived joshua who had seen all the greatworks of the lord that he did for israel and joshua the son of nun the servant of the lord died being anhundred and ten years old and they buried him in the border of his inheritance intimnathheres in the mount of ephraim on the north side of the hillgaash and also all that generation were gathered unto their fathersand there arose another generation after them which knew not thelord nor yet the works which he had done for israel and the children of israel did evil in the sight of the lord andserved baalim  and they forsook the lord god of their fatherswhich brought them out of the land of egypt and followed other godsof the gods of the people that were round about them and bowedthemselves unto them and provoked the lord to anger and they forsook the lord and served baal and ashtaroth and the anger of the lord was hot against israel and hedelivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them and hesold them into the hands of their enemies round about so that theycould not any longer stand before their enemies whithersoever they went out the hand of the lord was againstthem for evil as the lord had said and as the lord had sworn untothem and they were greatly distressed nevertheless the lord raised up judges which delivered them outof the hand of those that spoiled them and yet they would not hearken unto their judges but they went awhoring after other gods and bowed themselves unto them they turnedquickly out of the way which their fathers walked in obeying thecommandments of the lord but they did not so and when the lord raised them up judges then the lord was withthe judge and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all thedays of the judge for it repented the lord because of their groaningsby reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them and it came to pass when the judge was dead that they returnedand corrupted themselves more than their fathers in following othergods to serve them and to bow down unto them they ceased not fromtheir own doings nor from their stubborn way and the anger of the lord was hot against israel and he saidbecause that this people hath transgressed my covenant which icommanded their fathers and have not hearkened unto my voice  ialso will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nationswhich joshua left when he died  that through them i may proveisrael whether they will keep the way of the lord to walk therein astheir fathers did keep it or not therefore the lord left those nations without driving them outhastily neither delivered he them into the hand of joshua now these are the nations which the lord left to prove israel bythem even as many of israel as had not known all the wars of canaan only that the generations of the children of israel might know toteach them war at the least such as before knew nothing thereof namely five lords of the philistines and all the canaanites and thesidonians and the hivites that dwelt in mount lebanon from mountbaalhermon unto the entering in of hamath and they were to prove israel by them to know whether they wouldhearken unto the commandments of the lord which he commanded theirfathers by the hand of moses and the children of israel dwelt among the canaanites hittitesand amorites and perizzites and hivites and jebusites  and theytook their daughters to be their wives and gave their daughters totheir sons and served their gods and the children of israel did evil in the sight of the lord andforgat the lord their god and served baalim and the groves therefore the anger of the lord was hot against israel and hesold them into the hand of chushanrishathaim king of mesopotamia andthe children of israel served chushanrishathaim eight years and when the children of israel cried unto the lord the lordraised up a deliverer to the children of israel who delivered themeven othniel the son of kenaz calebs younger brother and the spirit of the lord came upon him and he judged israeland went out to war and the lord delivered chushanrishathaim king ofmesopotamia into his hand and his hand prevailed againstchushanrishathaim and the land had rest forty years and othniel the son of kenazdied and the children of israel did evil again in the sight of thelord and the lord strengthened eglon the king of moab against israelbecause they had done evil in the sight of the lord and he gathered unto him the children of ammon and amalek andwent and smote israel and possessed the city of palm trees so the children of israel served eglon the king of moab eighteenyears but when the children of israel cried unto the lord the lordraised them up a deliverer ehud the son of gera a benjamite a manlefthanded and by him the children of israel sent a present untoeglon the king of moab but ehud made him a dagger which had two edges of a cubitlength and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh and he brought the present unto eglon king of moab and eglon wasa very fat man and when he had made an end to offer the present he sent awaythe people that bare the present but he himself turned again from the quarries that were bygilgal and said i have a secret errand unto thee o king who saidkeep silence and all that stood by him went out from him and ehud came unto him and he was sitting in a summer parlourwhich he had for himself alone and ehud said i have a message fromgod unto theeand he arose out of his seat and ehud put forth his left hand and took the dagger from hisright thigh and thrust it into his belly  and the haft also wentin after the blade and the fat closed upon the blade so that hecould not draw the dagger out of his belly and the dirt came out then ehud went forth through the porch and shut the doors of theparlour upon him and locked them when he was gone out his servants came and when they saw thatbehold the doors of the parlour were locked they said surely hecovereth his feet in his summer chamber and they tarried till they were ashamed and behold he openednot the doors of the parlour therefore they took a key and openedthem and behold their lord was fallen down dead on the earth and ehud escaped while they tarried and passed beyond thequarries and escaped unto seirath and it came to pass when he was come that he blew a trumpet inthe mountain of ephraim and the children of israel went down with himfrom the mount and he before them and he said unto them follow after me for the lord hathdelivered your enemies the moabites into your hand and they went downafter him and took the fords of jordan toward moab and suffered nota man to pass over and they slew of moab at that time about ten thousand men alllusty and all men of valour and there escaped not a man so moab was subdued that day under the hand of israel and theland had rest fourscore years and after him was shamgar the son of anath which slew of thephilistines six hundred men with an ox goad and he also deliveredisrael and the children of israel again did evil in the sight of thelord when ehud was dead and the lord sold them into the hand of jabin king of canaan thatreigned in hazor the captain of whose host was sisera which dwelt inharosheth of the gentiles and the children of israel cried unto the lord for he had ninehundred chariots of iron and twenty years he mightily oppressed thechildren of israel and deborah a prophetess the wife of lapidoth she judged israelat that time and she dwelt under the palm tree of deborah between ramah andbethel in mount ephraim and the children of israel came up to her forjudgment and she sent and called barak the son of abinoam out ofkedeshnaphtali and said unto him hath not the lord god of israelcommanded saying go and draw toward mount tabor and take with theeten thousand men of the children of naphtali and of the children ofzebulun   and i will draw unto thee to the river kishon siserathe captain of jabins army with his chariots and his multitude andi will deliver him into thine hand and barak said unto her if thou wilt go with me then i will gobut if thou wilt not go with me then i will not go and she said i will surely go with thee notwithstanding thejourney that thou takest shall not be for thine honour for the lordshall sell sisera into the hand of a woman and deborah arose andwent with barak to kedesh and barak called zebulun and naphtali to kedesh and he went upwith ten thousand men at his feet and deborah went up with him now heber the kenite which was of the children of hobab thefather in law of moses had severed himself from the kenites andpitched his tent unto the plain of zaanaim which is by kedesh and they shewed sisera that barak the son of abinoam was gone upto mount tabor and sisera gathered together all his chariots even nine hundredchariots of iron and all the people that were with him fromharosheth of the gentiles unto the river of kishon and deborah said unto barak up for this is the day in which thelord hath delivered sisera into thine hand is not the lord gone outbefore thee so barak went down from mount tabor and ten thousand menafter him and the lord discomfited sisera and all his chariots and allhis host with the edge of the sword before barak so that siseralighted down off his chariot and fled away on his feet but barak pursued after the chariots and after the host untoharosheth of the gentiles and all the host of sisera fell upon theedge of the sword and there was not a man left howbeit sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of jael the wifeof heber the kenite for there was peace between jabin the king ofhazor and the house of heber the kenite and jael went out to meet sisera and said unto him turn in mylord turn in to me fear not and when he had turned in unto her intothe tent she covered him with a mantle and he said unto her give me i pray thee a little water todrink for i am thirsty and she opened a bottle of milk and gave himdrink and covered him again he said unto her stand in the door of the tent and itshall be when any man doth come and enquire of thee and say isthere any man here that thou shalt say no then jael hebers wife took a nail of the tent and took anhammer in her hand and went softly unto him and smote the nail intohis temples and fastened it into the ground for he was fast asleepand weary so he died and behold as barak pursued sisera jael came out to meet himand said unto him come and i will shew thee the man whom thouseekest and when he came into her tent behold sisera lay dead andthe nail was in his temples so god subdued on that day jabin the king of canaan before thechildren of israel and the hand of the children of israel prospered and prevailedagainst jabin the king of canaan until they had destroyed jabin kingof canaan then sang deborah and barak the son of abinoam on that daysaying  praise ye the lord for the avenging of israel when thepeople willingly offered themselves hear o ye kings give ear o ye princes i even i will singunto the lord i will

or two to sisera a prey ofdivers colours a prey of divers colours of needlework of diverscolours of needlework on both sides meet for the necks of them thattake the spoil   so let all thine enemies perish o lord but letthem that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might andthe land had rest forty years and the children of israel did evil in the sight of the lord andthe lord delivered them into the hand of midian seven years and the hand of midian prevailed against israel and because ofthe midianites the children of israel made them the dens which are inthe mountains and caves and strong holds and so it was when israel had sown that the midianites came upand the amalekites and the children of the east even they came upagainst them  and they encamped against them and destroyed theincrease of the earth till thou come unto gaza and left nosustenance for israel neither sheep nor ox nor ass for they came up with their cattle and their tents and they cameas grasshoppers for multitude for both they and their camels werewithout number and they entered into the land to destroy it and israel was greatly impoverished because of the midianites andthe children of israel cried unto the lord and it came to pass when the children of israel cried unto thelord because of the midianites  that the lord sent a prophet untothe children of israel which said unto them thus saith the lord godof israel i brought you up from egypt and brought you forth out ofthe house of bondage  and i delivered you out of the hand of theegyptians and out of the hand of all that oppressed you and dravethem out from before you and gave you their land  and i saidunto you i am the lord your god fear not the gods of the amoritesin whose land ye dwell but ye have not obeyed my voice and there came an angel of the lord and sat under an oak whichwas in ophrah that pertained unto joash the abiezrite and his songideon threshed wheat by the winepress to hide it from themidianites and the angel of the lord appeared unto him and said unto himthe lord is with thee thou mighty man of valour and gideon said unto him oh my lord if the lord be with us whythen is all this befallen us and where be all his miracles which ourfathers told us of saying did not the lord bring us up from egyptbut now the lord hath forsaken us and delivered us into the hands ofthe midianites and the lord looked upon him and said go in this thy might andthou shalt save israel from the hand of the midianites have not isent thee   and he said unto him oh my lord wherewith shall isave israel  behold my family is poor in manasseh and i am theleast in my fathers house and the lord said unto him surely i will be with thee and thoushalt smite the midianites as one man and he said unto him if now i have found grace in thy sightthen shew me a sign that thou talkest with me depart not hence i pray thee until i come unto thee and bringforth my present and set it before thee and he said i will tarryuntil thou come again and gideon went in and made ready a kid and unleavened cakes ofan ephah of flour the flesh he put in a basket and he put the brothin a pot and brought it out unto him under the oak and presented it and the angel of god said unto him take the flesh and theunleavened cakes and lay them upon this rock and pour out the brothand he did so then the angel of the lord put forth the end of the staff thatwas in his hand and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes andthere rose up fire out of the rock and consumed the flesh and theunleavened cakes then the angel of the lord departed out of hissight and when gideon perceived that he was an angel of the lordgideon said alas o lord god for because i have seen an angel of thelord face to face and the lord said unto him peace be unto thee fear not thoushalt not die then gideon built an altar there unto the lord and called itjehovahshalom unto this day it is yet in ophrah of the abiezrites and it came to pass the same night that the lord said unto himtake thy fathers young bullock even the second bullock of sevenyears old and throw down the altar of baal that thy father hath andcut down the grove that is by it  and build an altar unto thelord thy god upon the top of this rock in the ordered place and takethe second bullock and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of thegrove which thou shalt cut down then gideon took ten men of his servants and did as the lord hadsaid unto him and so it was because he feared his fathershousehold and the men of the city that he could not do it by daythat he did it by night and when the men of the city arose early in the morning beholdthe altar of baal was cast down and the grove was cut down that wasby it and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that wasbuilt and they said one to another who hath done this thing and whenthey enquired and asked they said gideon the son of joash hath donethis thing then the men of the city said unto joash bring out thy son thathe may die because he hath cast down the altar of baal and becausehe hath cut down the grove that was by it and joash said unto all that stood against him will ye plead forbaal will ye save him he that will plead for him let him be put todeath whilst it is yet morning if he be a god let him plead forhimself because one hath cast down his altar therefore on that day he called him jerubbaal saying let baalplead against him because he hath thrown down his altar then all the midianites and the amalekites and the children ofthe east were gathered together and went over and pitched in thevalley of jezreel but the spirit of the lord came upon gideon and he blew atrumpet and abiezer was gathered after him and he sent messengers throughout all manasseh who also wasgathered after him and he sent messengers unto asher and untozebulun and unto naphtali and they came up to meet them and gideon said unto god if thou wilt save israel by mine handas thou hast said  behold i will put a fleece of wool in thefloor and if the dew be on the fleece only and it be dry upon allthe earth beside then shall i know that thou wilt save israel by minehand as thou hast said and it was so for he rose up early on the morrow and thrust thefleece together and wringed the dew out of the fleece a bowl full ofwater and gideon said unto god let not thine anger be hot against meand i will speak but this once let me prove i pray thee but thisonce with the fleece let it now be dry only upon the fleece and uponall the ground let there be dew and god did so that night for it was dry upon the fleece onlyand there was dew on all the ground then jerubbaal who is gideon and all the people that were withhim rose up early and pitched beside the well of harod so that thehost of the midianites were on the north side of them by the hill ofmoreh in the valley and the lord said unto gideon the people that are with thee aretoo many for me to give the midianites into their hands lest israelvaunt themselves against me saying mine own hand hath saved me now therefore go to proclaim in the ears of the people sayingwhosoever is fearful and afraid let him return and depart early frommount gilead and there returned of the people twenty and twothousand and there remained ten thousand and the lord said unto gideon the people are yet too many bringthem down unto the water and i will try them for thee there and itshall be that of whom i say unto thee this shall go with thee thesame shall go with thee and of whomsoever i say unto thee this shallnot go with thee the same shall not go so he brought down the people unto the water and the lord saidunto gideon every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue as adog lappeth him shalt thou set by himself likewise every one thatboweth down upon his knees to drink and the number of them that lapped putting their hand to theirmouth were three hundred men but all the rest of the people boweddown upon their knees to drink water and the lord said unto gideon by the three hundred men thatlapped will i save you and deliver the midianites into thine handand let all the other people go every man unto his place so the people took victuals in their hand and their trumpets andhe sent all the rest of israel every man unto his tent and retainedthose three hundred men and the host of midian was beneath him in thevalley and it came to pass the same night that the lord said unto himarise get thee down unto the host for i have delivered it into thinehand but if thou fear to go down go thou with phurah thy servant downto the host  and thou shalt hear what they say and afterwardshall thine hands be strengthened to go down unto the host then wenthe down with phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men thatwere in the host and the midianites and the amalekites and all the children of theeast lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude andtheir camels were without number as the sand by the sea side formultitude and when gideon was come behold there was a man that told adream unto his fellow and said behold i dreamed a dream and lo acake of barley bread tumbled into the host of midian and came unto atent and smote it that it fell and overturned it that the tent layalong and his fellow answered and said this is nothing else save thesword of gideon the son of joash a man of israel for into his handhath god delivered midian and all the host and it was so when gideon heard the telling of the dream andthe interpretation thereof that he worshipped and returned into thehost of israel and said arise for the lord hath delivered into yourhand the host of midian and he divided the three hundred men into three companies and heput a trumpet in every mans hand with empty pitchers and lampswithin the pitchers and he said unto them look on me and do likewise and beholdwhen i come to the outside of the camp it shall be that as i do soshall ye do when i blow with a trumpet i and all that are with me then blowye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp and say the swordof the lord and of gideon so gideon and the hundred men that were with him came unto theoutside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch and they hadbut newly set the watch and they blew the trumpets and brake thepitchers that were in their hands and the three companies blew the trumpets and brake thepitchers and held the lamps in their left hands and the trumpets intheir right hands to blow withal and they cried the sword of thelord and of gideon and they stood every man in his place round about the camp andall the host ran and cried and fled and the three hundred blew the trumpets and the lord set everymans sword against his fellow even throughout all the host and thehost fled to bethshittah in zererath and to the border ofabelmeholah unto tabbath and the men of israel gathered themselves together out ofnaphtali and out of asher and out of all manasseh and pursued afterthe midianites and gideon sent messengers throughout all mount ephraim sayingcome down against the midianites and take before them the waters untobethbarah and jordan then all the men of ephraim gathered themselvestogether and took the waters unto bethbarah and jordan and they took two princes of the midianites oreb and zeeb andthey slew oreb upon the rock oreb and zeeb they slew at the winepressof zeeb and pursued midian and brought the heads of oreb and zeeb togideon on the other side jordan and the men of ephraim said unto him why hast thou served usthus that thou calledst us not when thou wentest to fight with themidianites  and they did chide with him sharply and he said unto them what have i done now in comparison of youis not the gleaning of the grapes of ephraim better than the vintageof abiezer   god hath delivered into your hands the princes ofmidian oreb and zeeb and what was i able to do in comparison of youthen their anger was abated toward him when he had said that and gideon came to jordan and passed over he and the threehundred men that were with him faint yet pursuing them and he said unto the men of succoth give i pray you loaves ofbread unto the people that follow me for they be faint and i ampursuing after zebah and zalmunna kings of midian and the princes of succoth said are the hands of zebah andzalmunna now in thine hand that we should give bread unto thine army and gideon said therefore when the lord hath delivered zebah andzalmunna into mine hand then i will tear your flesh with the thornsof the wilderness and with briers and he went up thence to penuel and spake unto them likewise andthe men of penuel answered him as the men of succoth had answered him and he spake also unto the men of penuel saying when i comeagain in peace i will break down this tower now zebah and zalmunna were in karkor and their hosts with themabout fifteen thousand men all that were left of all the hosts of thechildren of the east for there fell an hundred and twenty thousandmen that drew sword and gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on theeast of nobah and jogbehah and smote the host for the host wassecure and when zebah and zalmunna fled he pursued after them and tookthe two kings of midian zebah and zalmunna and discomfited all thehost and gideon the son of joash returned from battle before the sunwas up  and caught a young man of the men of succoth andenquired of him and he described unto him the princes of succoth andthe elders thereof even threescore and seventeen men and he came unto the men of succoth and said behold zebah andzalmunna with whom ye did upbraid me saying are the hands of zebahand zalmunna now in thine hand that we should give bread unto thy menthat are weary   and he took the elders of the city and thornsof the wilderness and briers and with them he taught the men ofsuccoth and he beat down the tower of penuel and slew the men of thecity then said he unto zebah and zalmunna what manner of men werethey whom ye slew at tabor and they answered as thou art so werethey each one resembled the children of a king and he said they were my brethren even the sons of my motheras the lord liveth if ye had saved them alive i would not slay you and he said unto jether his firstborn up and slay them but theyouth drew not his sword for he feared because he was yet a youth then zebah and zalmunna said rise thou and fall upon us for asthe man is so is his strength and gideon arose and slew zebah andzalmunna and took away the ornaments that were on their camelsnecks then the men of israel said unto gideon rule thou over us boththou and thy son and thy sons son also for thou hast delivered usfrom the hand of midian and gideon said unto them i will not rule over you neithershall my son rule over you the lord shall rule over you and gideon said unto them i would desire a request of you thatye would give me every man the earrings of his prey for they hadgolden earrings because they were ishmaelites   and theyanswered we will willingly give them and they spread a garment anddid cast therein every man the earrings of his prey and the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was athousand and seven hundred shekels of gold beside ornaments andcollars and purple raiment that was on the kings of midian andbeside the chains that were about their camels necks and gideon made an ephod thereof and put it in his city even inophrah and all israel went thither a whoring after it which thingbecame a snare unto gideon and to his house thus was midian subdued before the children of israel so thatthey lifted up their heads no more and the country was in quietnessforty years in the days of gideon and jerubbaal the son of joash went and dwelt in his own house and gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten forhe had many wives and his concubine that was in shechem she also bare him a sonwhose name he called abimelech and gideon the son of joash died in a good old age and wasburied in the sepulchre of joash his father in ophrah of theabiezrites and it came to pass as soon as gideon was dead that thechildren of israel turned again and went a whoring after baalim andmade baalberith their god and the children of israel remembered not the lord their god whohad delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies on everyside  neither shewed they kindness to the house of jerubbaalnamely gideon according to all the goodness which he had shewed untoisrael and abimelech the son of jerubbaal went to shechem unto hismothers brethren and communed with them and with all the family ofthe house of his mothers father saying  speak i pray you inthe ears of all the men of shechem whether is better for you eitherthat all the sons of jerubbaal which are threescore and ten personsreign over you or that one reign over you remember also that i amyour bone and your flesh and his mothers brethren spake of him in the ears of all the menof shechem all these words and their hearts inclined to followabimelech for they said he is our brother and they gave him threescore and ten pieces of silver out of thehouse of baalberith wherewith abimelech hired vain and light personswhich followed him and he went unto his fathers house at ophrah and slew hisbrethren the sons of jerubbaal being threescore and ten persons uponone stone notwithstanding yet jotham the youngest son of jerubbaalwas left for he hid himself and all the men of shechem gathered together and all the house ofmillo and went and made abimelech king by the plain of the pillarthat was in shechem and when they told it to jotham he went and stood in the top ofmount gerizim and lifted up his voice and cried and said unto themhearken unto me ye men of shechem that god may hearken unto you the trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them andthey said unto the olive tree reign thou over us but the olive tree said unto them should i leave my fatnesswherewith by me they honour god and man and go to be promoted overthe trees   and the trees said to the fig tree come thou andreign over us but the fig tree said unto them should i forsake my sweetnessand my good fruit and go to be promoted over the trees   thensaid the trees unto the vine come thou and reign over us and the vine said unto them should i leave my wine whichcheereth god and man and go to be promoted over the trees   thensaid all the trees unto the bramble come thou and reign over us and the bramble said unto the trees if in truth ye anoint meking over you then come and put your trust in my shadow and if notlet fire come out of the bramble and devour the cedars of lebanon now therefore if ye have done truly and sincerely in that yehave made abimelech king and if ye have dealt well with jerubbaal andhis house and have done unto him according to the deserving of hishands  for my father fought for you and adventured his lifefar and delivered you out of the hand of midian  and ye arerisen up against my fathers house this day and have slain his sonsthreescore and ten persons upon one stone and have made abimelechthe son of his maidservant king over the men of shechem because heis your brother  if ye then have dealt truly and sincerely withjerubbaal and with his house this day then rejoice ye in abimelechand let him also rejoice in you  but if not let fire come outfrom abimelech and devour the men of shechem and the house of milloand let fire come out from the men of shechem and from the house ofmillo and devour abimelech and jotham ran away and fled and went to beer and dwelt therefor fear of abimelech his brother when abimelech had reigned three years over israel  then godsent an evil spirit between abimelech and the men of shechem and themen of shechem dealt treacherously with abimelech  that thecruelty done to the threescore and ten sons of jerubbaal might comeand their blood be laid upon abimelech their brother which slew themand upon the men of shechem which aided him in the killing of hisbrethren and the men of shechem set liers in wait for him in the top ofthe mountains and they robbed all that came along that way by themand it was told abimelech and gaal the son of ebed came with his brethren and went over toshechem and the men of shechem put their confidence in him and they went out into the fields and gathered their vineyardsand trode the grapes and made merry and went into the house of theirgod and did eat and drink and cursed abimelech and gaal the son of ebed said who is abimelech and who isshechem that we should serve him is not he the son of jerubbaal andzebul his officer serve the men of hamor the father of shechem forwhy should we serve him   and would to god this people were undermy hand then would i remove abimelech and he said to abimelechincrease thine army and come out and when zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of gaal theson of ebed his anger was kindled and he sent messengers unto abimelech privily saying beholdgaal the son of ebed and his brethren be come to shechem and beholdthey fortify the city against thee now therefore up by night thou and the people that is with theeand lie in wait in the field  and it shall be that in themorning as soon as the sun is up thou shalt rise early and set uponthe city and behold when he and the people that is with him comeout against thee then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt findoccasion and abimelech rose up and all the people that were with him bynight and they laid wait against shechem in four companies and gaal the son of ebed went out and stood in the entering ofthe gate of the city and abimelech rose up and the people that werewith him from lying in wait and when gaal saw the people he said to zebul behold therecome people down from the top of the mountains and zebul said untohim thou seest the shadow of the mountains as if they were men and gaal spake again and said see there come people down by themiddle of the land and another company come along by the plain ofmeonenim then said zebul unto him where is now thy mouth wherewith thousaidst who is abimelech that we should serve him is not this thepeople that thou hast despised go out i pray now and fight withthem and gaal went out before the men of shechem and fought withabimelech and abimelech chased him and he fled before him and many wereoverthrown and wounded even unto the entering of the gate and abimelech dwelt at arumah and zebul thrust out gaal and hisbrethren that they should not dwell in shechem and it came to pass on the morrow that the people went out intothe field and they told abimelech and he took the people and divided them into three companiesand laid wait in the field and looked and behold the people werecome forth out of the city and he rose up against them and smotethem and abimelech and the company that was with him rushed forwardand stood in the entering of the gate of the city and the two othercompanies ran upon all the people that were in the fields and slewthem and abimelech fought against the city all that day and he tookthe city and slew the people that was therein and beat down thecity and sowed it with salt and when all the men of the tower of shechem heard that theyentered into an hold of the house of the god berith and it was told abimelech that all the men of the tower ofshechem were gathered together and abimelech gat him up to mount zalmon he and all the peoplethat were with him and abimelech took an axe in his hand and cutdown a bough from the trees and took it and laid it on his shoulderand said unto the people that were with him what ye have seen me domake haste and do as i have done and all the people likewise cut down every man his bough andfollowed abimelech and put them to the hold and set the hold on fireupon them so that all the men of the tower of shechem died alsoabout a thousand men and women then went abimelech to thebez and encamped against thebez andtook it but there was a strong tower within the city and thither fledall the men and women and all they of the city and shut it to themand gat them up to the top of the tower and abimelech came unto the tower and fought against it andwent hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire and a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon abimelechshead and all to brake his skull then he called hastily unto the young man his armourbearer andsaid unto him draw thy sword and slay me that men say not of me awomen slew him and his young man thrust him through and he died and when the men of israel saw that abimelech was dead theydeparted every man unto his place thus god rendered the wickedness of abimelech which he did untohis father in slaying his seventy brethren  and all the evil ofthe men of shechem did god render upon their heads and upon them camethe curse of jotham the son of jerubbaal and after abimelech there arose to defend israel tola the son ofpuah the son of dodo a man of issachar and he dwelt in shamir inmount ephraim and he judged israel twenty and three years and died and wasburied in shamir and after him arose jair a gileadite and judged israel twentyand two years and he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts and theyhad thirty cities which are called havothjair unto this day whichare in the land of gilead and jair died and was buried in camon and the children of israel did evil again in the sight of thelord and served baalim and ashtaroth and the gods of syria and thegods of zidon and the gods of moab and the gods of the children ofammon and the gods of the philistines and forsook the lord andserved not him and the anger of the lord was hot against israel and he soldthem into the hands of the philistines and into the hands of thechildren of ammon and that year they vexed and oppressed the children of israeleighteen years all the children of israel that were on the other sidejordan in the land of the amorites which is in gilead moreover the children of ammon passed over jordan to fight alsoagainst judah and against benjamin and against the house of ephraimso that israel was sore distressed and the children of israel cried unto the lord saying we havesinned against thee both because we have forsaken our god and alsoserved baalim and the lord said unto the children of israel did not i deliveryou from the egyptians and from the amorites from the children ofammon and from the philistines   the zidonians also and theamalekites and the maonites did oppress you and ye cried to me andi delivered you out of their hand yet ye have forsaken me and served other gods wherefore i willdeliver you no more go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen let them deliveryou in the time of your tribulation and the children of israel said unto the lord we have sinneddo thou unto us whatsoever seemeth good unto thee deliver us only wepray thee this day and they put away the strange gods from among them and servedthe lord and his soul was grieved for the misery of israel then the children of ammon were gathered together and encampedin gilead and the children of israel assembled themselves togetherand encamped in mizpeh and the people and princes of gilead said one to another whatman is he that will begin to fight against the children of ammon heshall be head over all the inhabitants of gilead now jephthah the gileadite was a mighty man of valour and he wasthe son of an harlot and gilead begat jephthah and gileads wife bare him sons and his wifes sons grew up andthey thrust out jephthah and said unto him thou shalt not inherit inour fathers house for thou art the son of a strange woman then jephthah fled from his brethren and dwelt in the land oftob and there were gathered vain men to jephthah and went out withhim and it came to pass in process of time that the children ofammon made war against israel and it was so that when the children of ammon made war againstisrael the elders of gilead went to fetch jephthah out of the land oftob  and they said unto jephthah come and be our captain thatwe may fight with the children of ammon and jephthah said unto the elders of gilead did not ye hate meand expel me out of my fathers house and why are ye come unto me nowwhen ye are in distress   and the elders of gilead said untojephthah therefore we turn again to thee now that thou mayest gowith us and fight against the children of ammon and be our head overall the inhabitants of gilead and jephthah said unto the elders of gilead if ye bring me homeagain to fight against the children of ammon and the lord deliverthem before me shall i be your head   and the elders of gileadsaid unto jephthah the lord be witness between us if we do not soaccording to thy words then jephthah went with the elders of gilead and the peoplemade him head and captain over them and jephthah uttered all hiswords before the lord in mizpeh and jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children ofammon saying what hast thou to do with me that thou art comeagainst me to fight in my land   and the king of the children ofammon answered unto the messengers of jephthah because israel tookaway my land when they came up out of egypt from arnon even untojabbok and unto jordan now therefore restore those lands againpeaceably and jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the childrenof ammon  and said unto him thus saith jephthah israel tooknot away the land of moab nor the land of the children of ammon but when israel came up from egypt and walked through thewilderness unto the red sea and came to kadesh  then israelsent messengers unto the king of edom saying let me i pray theepass through thy land but the king of edom would not hearken theretoand in like manner they sent unto the king of moab but he would notconsent and israel abode in kadesh then they went along through the wilderness and compassed theland of edom and the land of moab and came by the east side of theland of moab and pitched on the other side of arnon but came notwithin the border of moab for arnon was the border of moab and israel sent messengers unto sihon king of the amorites theking of heshbon and israel said unto him let us pass we pray theethrough thy land into my place but sihon trusted not israel to pass through his coast butsihon gathered all his people together and pitched in jahaz andfought against israel and the lord god of israel delivered sihon and all his peopleinto the hand of israel and they smote them so israel possessed allthe land of the amorites the inhabitants of that country and they possessed all the coasts of the amorites from arnoneven unto jabbok and from the wilderness even unto jordan so now the lord god of israel hath dispossessed the amoritesfrom before his people israel and shouldest thou possess it  wilt not thou possess that which chemosh thy god giveth thee topossess so whomsoever the lord our god shall drive out from beforeus them will we possess and now art thou any thing better than balak the son of zipporking of moab did he ever strive against israel or did he ever fightagainst them  while israel dwelt in heshbon and her towns andin aroer and her towns and in all the cities that be along by thecoasts of arnon three hundred years why therefore did ye not recoverthem within that time   wherefore i have not sinned againstthee but thou doest me wrong to war against me the lord the judge bejudge this day between the children of israel and the children ofammon howbeit the king of the children of ammon hearkened not unto thewords of jephthah which he sent him then the spirit of the lord came upon jephthah and he passedover gilead and manasseh and passed over mizpeh of gilead and frommizpeh of gilead he passed over unto the children of ammon and jephthah vowed a vow unto the lord and said if thou shaltwithout fail deliver the children of ammon into mine hands  thenit shall be that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house tomeet me when i return in peace from the children of ammon shallsurely be the lords and i will offer it up for a burnt offering so jephthah passed over unto the children of ammon to fightagainst them and the lord delivered them into his hands and he smote them from aroer even till thou come to minnitheven twenty cities and unto the plain of the vineyards with a verygreat slaughter thus the children of ammon were subdued before thechildren of israel and jephthah came to mizpeh unto his house and behold hisdaughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances and shewas his only child beside her he had neither son nor daughter and it came to pass when he saw her that he rent his clothesand said alas my daughter thou hast brought me very low and thouart one of them that trouble me for i have opened my mouth unto thelord and i cannot go back and she said unto him my father if thou hast opened thy mouthunto the lord do to me according to that which hath proceeded out ofthy mouth forasmuch as the lord hath taken vengeance for thee ofthine enemies even of the children of ammon and she said unto her father let this thing be done for me letme alone two months that i may go up and down upon the mountains andbewail my virginity i and my fellows and he said go and he sent her away for two months and shewent with her companions and bewailed her virginity upon themountains and it came to pass at the end of two months that she returnedunto her father who did with her according to his vow which he hadvowed and she knew no man and it was a custom in israel  thatthe daughters of israel went yearly to lament the daughter of jephthahthe gileadite four days in a year and the men of ephraim gathered themselves together and wentnorthward and said unto jephthah wherefore passedst thou over tofight against the children of ammon and didst not call us to go withthee we will burn thine house upon thee with fire and jephthah said unto them i and my people were at great strifewith the children of ammon and when i called you ye delivered me notout of their hands and when i saw that ye delivered me not i put my life in myhands and passed over against the children of ammon and the lorddelivered them into my hand wherefore then are ye come up unto methis day to fight against me   then jephthah gathered togetherall the men of gilead and fought with ephraim and the men of gileadsmote ephraim because they said ye gileadites are fugitives ofephraim among the ephraimites and among the manassites and the gileadites took the passages of jordan before theephraimites and it was so that when those ephraimites which wereescaped said let me go over that the men of gilead said unto himart thou an ephraimite if he said nay  then said they unto himsay now shibboleth and he said sibboleth for he could not frame topronounce it right then they took him and slew him at the passagesof jordan and there fell at that time of the ephraimites forty andtwo thousand and jephthah judged israel six years then died jephthah thegileadite and was buried in one of the cities of gilead and after him ibzan of bethlehem judged israel and he had thirty sons and thirty daughters whom he sentabroad and took in thirty daughters from abroad for his sons and hejudged israel seven years then died ibzan and was buried at bethlehem and after him elon a zebulonite judged israel and he judgedisrael ten years and elon the zebulonite died and was buried in aijalon in thecountry of zebulun and after him abdon the son of hillel a pirathonite judgedisrael and he had forty sons and thirty nephews that rode onthreescore and ten ass colts and he judged israel eight years and abdon the son of hillel the pirathonite died and was buriedin pirathon in the land of ephraim in the mount of the amalekites and the children of israel did evil again in the sight of thelord and the lord delivered them into the hand of the philistinesforty years and there was a certain man of zorah of the family of thedanites whose name was manoah and his wife was barren and bare not and the angel of the lord appeared unto the woman and said untoher behold now thou art barren and bearest not but thou shaltconceive and bear a son now therefore beware i pray thee and drink not wine nor strongdrink and eat not any unclean thing  for lo thou shaltconceive and bear a son and no razor shall come on his head for thechild shall be a nazarite unto god from the womb and he shall beginto deliver israel out of the hand of the philistines then the woman came and told her husband saying a man of godcame unto me and his countenance was like the countenance of an angelof god very terrible but i asked him not whence he was neither toldhe me his name  but he said unto me behold thou shalt conceiveand bear a son and now drink no wine nor strong drink neither eatany unclean thing for the child shall be a nazarite to god from thewomb to the day of his death then manoah intreated the lord and said o my lord let the manof god which thou didst send come again unto us and teach us what weshall do unto the child that shall be born and god hearkened to the voice of manoah and the angel of godcame again unto the woman as she sat in the field but manoah herhusband was not with her and the woman made haste and ran and shewed her husband andsaid unto him behold the man hath appeared unto me that came untome the other day and manoah arose and went after his wife and came to the manand said unto him art thou the man that spakest unto the woman andhe said i am and manoah said now let thy words come to pass how shall weorder the child and how shall we do unto him   and the angel ofthe lord said unto manoah of all that i said unto the woman let herbeware she may not eat of any thing that cometh of the vine neitherlet her drink wine or strong drink nor eat any unclean thing allthat i commanded her let her observe and manoah said unto the angel of the lord i pray thee let usdetain thee until we shall have made ready a kid for thee and the angel of the lord said unto manoah though thou detainme i will not eat of thy bread and if thou wilt offer a burntoffering thou must offer it unto the lord for manoah knew not thathe was an angel of the lord and manoah said unto the angel of the lord what is thy namethat when thy sayings come to pass we may do thee honour   andthe angel of the lord said unto him why askest thou thus after myname seeing it is secret   so manoah took a kid with a meatoffering and offered it upon a rock unto the lord and the angel didwonderously and manoah and his wife looked on for it came to pass when the flame went up toward heaven fromoff the altar that the angel of the lord ascended in the flame of thealtar and manoah and his wife looked on it and fell on their facesto the ground but the angel of the lord did no more appear to manoah and tohis wife then manoah knew that he was an angel of the lord and manoah said unto his wife we shall surely die because wehave seen god but his wife said unto him if the lord were pleased to kill ushe would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at ourhands neither would he have shewed us all these things nor would asat this time have told us such things as these and the woman bare a son and called his name samson and thechild grew and the lord blessed him and the spirit of the lord began to move him at times in thecamp of dan between zorah and eshtaol and samson went down to timnath and saw a woman in timnath ofthe daughters of the philistines and he came up and told his father and his mother and said ihave seen a woman in timnath of the daughters of the philistines nowtherefore get her for me to wife then his father and his mother said unto him is there never awoman among the daughters of thy brethren or among all my peoplethat thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised philistines andsamson said unto his father get her for me for she pleaseth me well but his father and his mother knew not that it was of the lordthat he sought an occasion against the philistines for at that timethe philistines had dominion over israel then went samson down and his father and his mother to timnathand came to the vineyards of timnath and behold a young lion roaredagainst him and the spirit of the lord came mightily upon him and he renthim as he would have rent a kid and he had nothing in his hand buthe told not his father or his mother what he had done and he went down and talked with the woman and she pleasedsamson well and after a time he returned to take her and he turned aside tosee the carcase of the lion and behold there was a swarm of beesand honey in the carcase of the lion and he took thereof in his hands and went on eating and came tohis father and mother and he gave them and they did eat but he toldnot them that he had taken the honey out of the carcase of the lion so his father went down unto the woman and samson made there afeast for so used the young men to do and it came to pass when they saw him that they brought thirtycompanions to be with him and samson said unto them i will now put forth a riddle untoyou if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of thefeast and find it out then i will give you thirty sheets and thirtychange of garments  but if ye cannot declare it me then shallye give me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments and they saidunto him put forth thy riddle that we may hear it and he said unto them out of the eater came forth meat and outof the strong came forth sweetness and they could not in three daysexpound the riddle and it came to pass on the seventh day that they said untosamsons wife entice thy husband that he may declare unto us theriddle lest we burn thee and thy fathers house with fire have yecalled us to take that we have is it not so   and samsons wifewept before him and said thou dost but hate me and lovest me notthou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my people and hastnot told it me and he said unto her behold i have not told it myfather nor my mother and shall i tell it thee   and she weptbefore him the seven days while their feast lasted and it came topass on the seventh day that he told her because she lay sore uponhim and she told the riddle to the children of her people and the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day beforethe sun went down what is sweeter than honey and what is strongerthan a lion  and he said unto them if ye had not plowed with myheifer ye had not found out my riddle and the spirit of the lord came upon him and he went down toashkelon and slew thirty men of them and took their spoil and gavechange of garments unto them which expounded the riddle and his angerwas kindled and he went up to his fathers house but samsons wife was given to his companion whom he had usedas his friend but it came to pass within a while after in the time of wheatharvest that samson visited his wife with a kid and he said i willgo in to my wife into the chamber but her father would not suffer himto go in and her father said i verily thought that thou hadst utterlyhated her therefore i gave her to thy companion is not her youngersister fairer than she take her i pray thee instead of her and samson said concerning them now shall i be more blamelessthan the philistines though i do them a displeasure and samson went and caught three hundred foxes and tookfirebrands and turned tail to tail and put a firebrand in the midstbetween two tails and when he had set the brands on fire he let them go into thestanding corn of the philistines and burnt up both the shocks andalso the standing corn with the vineyards and olives then the philistines said who hath done this and they answeredsamson the son in law of the timnite because he had taken his wifeand given her to his companion and the philistines came up and burnther and her father with fire and samson said unto them though ye have done this yet will ibe avenged of you and after that i will cease and he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter and hewent down and dwelt in the top of the rock etam then the philistines went up and pitched in judah and spreadthemselves in lehi and the men of judah said why are ye come up against us andthey answered to bind samson are we come up to do to him as he hathdone to us then three thousand men of judah went to the top of the rocketam and said to samson knowest thou not that the philistines arerulers over us what is this that thou hast done unto us and he saidunto them as they did unto me so have i done unto them and they said unto him we are come down to bind thee that wemay deliver thee into the hand of the philistines and samson saidunto them swear unto me that ye will not fall upon me yourselves and they spake unto him saying no but we will bind thee fastand deliver thee into their hand but surely we will not kill theeand they bound him with two new cords and brought him up from therock and when he came unto lehi the philistines shouted against himand the spirit of the lord came mightily upon him and the cords thatwere upon his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire and hisbands loosed from off his hands and he found a new jawbone of an ass and put forth his handand took it and slew a thousand men therewith and samson said with the jawbone of an ass heaps upon heapswith the jaw of an ass have i slain a thousand men and it came to pass when he had made an end of speaking thathe cast away the jawbone out of his hand and called that placeramathlehi and he was sore athirst and called on the lord and said thouhast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy servant andnow shall i die for thirst and fall into the hand of theuncircumcised   but god clave an hollow place that was in thejaw and there came water thereout and when he had drunk his spiritcame again and he revived wherefore he called the name thereofenhakkore which is in lehi unto this day and he judged israel in the days of the philistines twentyyears then went samson to gaza and saw there an harlot and went inunto her and it was told the gazites saying samson is come hither andthey compassed him in and laid wait for him all night in the gate ofthe city and were quiet all the night saying in the morning whenit is day we shall kill him and samson lay till midnight and arose at midnight and took thedoors of the gate of the city and the two posts and went away withthem bar and all and put them upon his shoulders and carried themup to the top of an hill that is before hebron and it came to pass afterward that he loved a woman in thevalley of sorek whose name was delilah and the lords of the philistines came up unto her and said untoher entice him and see wherein his great strength lieth and by whatmeans we may prevail against him that we may bind him to afflict himand we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred pieces of silver and delilah said to samson tell me i pray thee wherein thygreat strength lieth and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflictthee and samson said unto her if they bind me with seven green withsthat were never dried then shall i be weak and be as another man then the lords of the philistines brought up to her seven greenwiths which had not been dried and she bound him with them now there were men lying in wait abiding with her in thechamberand she said unto him the philistines be upon thee samson and hebrake the withs as a thread of tow is broken when it toucheth thefire so his strength was not known and delilah said unto samson behold thou hast mocked me andtold me lies now tell me i pray thee wherewith thou mightest bebound and he said unto her if they bind me fast with new ropes thatnever were occupied then shall i be weak and be as another man delilah therefore took new ropes and bound him therewith andsaid unto him the philistines be upon thee samson and there wereliers in wait abiding in the chamber and he brake them from off hisarms like a thread and delilah said unto samson hitherto thou hast mocked me andtold me lies tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound and he saidunto her if thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web and she fastened it with the pin and said unto him thephilistines be upon thee samson and he awaked out of his sleep andwent away with the pin of the beam and with the web and she said unto him how canst thou say i love thee whenthine heart is not with me thou hast mocked me these three times andhast not told me wherein thy great strength lieth and it came to pass when she pressed him daily with her wordsand urged him so that his soul was vexed unto death  that hetold her all his heart and said unto her there hath not come a razorupon mine head for i have been a nazarite unto god from my motherswomb if i be shaven then my strength will go from me and i shallbecome weak and be like any other man and when delilah saw that he had told her all his heart shesent and called for the lords of the philistines saying come up thisonce for he hath shewed me all his heart then the lords of thephilistines came up unto her and brought money in their hand and she made him sleep upon her knees and she called for a manand she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head and shebegan to afflict him and his strength went from him and she said the philistines be upon thee samson and he awokeout of his sleep and said i will go out as at other times beforeand shake myself and he wist not that the lord was departed from him but the philistines took him and put out his eyes and broughthim down to gaza and bound him with fetters of brass and he didgrind in the prison house howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he wasshaven then the lords of the philistines gathered them together for tooffer a great sacrifice unto dagon their god and to rejoice for theysaid our god hath delivered samson our enemy into our hand and when the people saw him they praised their god for theysaid our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy and thedestroyer of our country which slew many of us and it came to pass when their hearts were merry that theysaid call for samson that he may make us sport and they called forsamson out of the prison house and he made them sport and they sethim between the pillars and samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand sufferme that i may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth that imay lean upon them now the house was full of men and women and all the lords ofthe philistines were there and there were upon the roof about threethousand men and women that beheld while samson made sport and samson called unto the lord and said o lord god rememberme i pray thee and strengthen me i pray thee only this once ogod that i may be at once avenged of the philistines for my two eyes and samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which thehouse stood and on which it was borne up of the one with his righthand and of the other with his left and samson said let me die with the philistines and he bowedhimself with all his might and the house fell upon the lords andupon all the people that were therein so the dead which he slew athis death were more than they which he slew in his life then his brethren and all the house of his father came down andtook him and brought him up and buried him between zorah and eshtaolin the buryingplace of manoah his father and he judged israel twentyyears and there was a man of mount ephraim whose name was micah and he said unto his mother the eleven hundred shekels of silverthat were taken from thee about which thou cursedst and spakest ofalso in mine ears behold the silver is with me i took it and hismother said blessed be thou of the lord my son and when he had restored the eleven hundred shekels of silver tohis mother his mother said i had wholly dedicated the silver untothe lord from my hand for my son to make a graven image and a moltenimage now therefore i will restore it unto thee yet he restored the money unto his mother and his mother tooktwo hundred shekels of silver and gave them to the founder who madethereof a graven image and a molten image and they were in the houseof micah and the man micah had an house of gods and made an ephod andteraphim and consecrated one of his sons who became his priest in those days there was no king in israel but every man did thatwhich was right in his own eyes and there was a young man out of bethlehemjudah of the family ofjudah who was a levite and he sojourned there and the man departed out of the city from bethlehemjudah tosojourn where he could find a place and he came to mount ephraim tothe house of micah as he journeyed and micah said unto him whence comest thou and he said untohim i am a levite of bethlehemjudah and i go to sojourn where i mayfind a place and micah said unto him dwell with me and be unto me a fatherand a priest and i will give thee ten shekels of silver by the yearand a suit of apparel and thy victuals so the levite went in and the levite was content to dwell with the man and the youngman was unto him as one of his sons and micah consecrated the levite and the young man became hispriest and was in the house of micah then said micah now know i that the lord will do me goodseeing i have a levite to my priest in those days there was no king in israel and in those days thetribe of the danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in for untothat day all their inheritance had not fallen unto them among thetribes of israel and the children of dan sent of their family five men from theircoasts men of valour from zorah and from eshtaol to spy out theland and to search it and they said unto them go search the landwho when they came to mount ephraim to the house of micah theylodged there when they were by the house of micah they knew the voice of theyoung man the levite and they turned in thither and said unto himwho brought thee hither and what makest thou in this place and whathast thou here   and he said unto them thus and thus dealethmicah with me and hath hired me and i am his priest and they said unto him ask counsel we pray thee of god thatwe may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous and the priest said unto them go in peace before the lord isyour way wherein ye go then the five men departed and came to laish and saw the peoplethat were therein how they dwelt careless after the manner of thezidonians quiet and secure and there was no magistrate in the landthat might put them to shame in any thing and they were far from thezidonians and had no business with any man and they came unto their brethren to zorah and eshtaol and theirbrethren said unto them what say ye   and they said arise thatwe may go up against them for we have seen the land and behold itis very good and are ye still be not slothful to go and to enter topossess the land when ye go ye shall come unto a people secure and to a largeland for god hath given it into your hands a place where there is nowant of any thing that is in the earth and there went from thence of the family of the danites out ofzorah and out of eshtaol six hundred men appointed with weapons ofwar and they went up and pitched in kirjathjearim in judahwherefore they called that place mahanehdan unto this day behold itis behind kirjathjearim and they passed thence unto mount ephraim and came unto thehouse of micah then answered the five men that went to spy out the country oflaish and said unto their brethren do ye know that there is in thesehouses an ephod and teraphim and a graven image and a molten imagenow therefore consider what ye have to do and they turned thitherward and came to the house of the youngman the levite even unto the house of micah and saluted him and the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of warwhich were of the children of dan stood by the entering of the gate and the five men that went to spy out the land went up and camein thither and took the graven image and the ephod and theteraphim and the molten image and the priest stood in the enteringof the gate with the six hundred men that were appointed with weaponsof war and these went into micahs house and fetched the carved imagethe ephod and the teraphim and the molten image then said thepriest unto them what do ye   and they said unto him hold thypeace lay thine hand upon thy mouth and go with us and be to us afather and a priest is it better for thee to be a priest unto thehouse of one man or that thou be a priest unto a tribe and a familyin israel   and the priests heart was glad and he took theephod and the teraphim and the graven image and went in the midstof the people so they turned and departed and put the little ones and thecattle and the carriage before them and when they were a good way from the house of micah the menthat were in the houses near to micahs house were gathered togetherand overtook the children of dan and they cried unto the children of dan and they turned theirfaces and said unto micah what aileth thee that thou comest withsuch a company   and he said ye have taken away my gods which imade and the priest and ye are gone away and what have i more andwhat is this that ye say unto me what aileth thee   and thechildren of dan said unto him let not thy voice be heard among uslest angry fellows run upon thee and thou lose thy life with thelives of thy household and the children of dan went their way and when micah saw thatthey were too strong for him he turned and went back unto his house and they took the things which micah had made and the priestwhich he had and came unto laish unto a people that were at quietand secure and they smote them with the edge of the sword and burntthe city with fire and there was no deliverer because it was far from zidon andthey had no business with any man and it was in the valley that liethby bethrehob and they built a city and dwelt therein and they called the name of the city dan after the name of dantheir father who was born unto israel howbeit the name of the citywas laish at the first and the children of dan set up the graven image and jonathanthe son of gershom the son of manasseh he and his sons were prieststo the tribe of dan until the day of the captivity of the land and they set them up micahs graven image which he made allthe time that the house of god was in shiloh and it came to pass in those days when there was no king inisrael that there was a certain levite sojourning on the side ofmount ephraim who took to him a concubine out of bethlehemjudah and his concubine played the whore against him and went awayfrom him unto her fathers house to bethlehemjudah and was there fourwhole months and her husband arose and went after her to speak friendly untoher and to bring her again having his servant with him and a coupleof asses and she brought him into her fathers house and when thefather of the damsel saw him he rejoiced to meet him and his father in law the damsels father retained him and heabode with him three days so they did eat and drink and lodgedthere and it came to pass on the fourth day when they arose early inthe morning that he rose up to depart and the damsels father saidunto his son in law comfort thine heart with a morsel of bread andafterward go your way and they sat down and did eat and drink both of them togetherfor the damsels father had said unto the man be content i praythee and tarry all night and let thine heart be merry and when the man rose up to depart his father in law urged himtherefore he lodged there again and he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart andthe damsels father said comfort thine heart i pray thee and theytarried until afternoon and they did eat both of them and when the man rose up to depart he and his concubine andhis servant his father in law the damsels father said unto himbehold now the day draweth toward evening i pray you tarry allnight behold the day groweth to an end lodge here that thine heartmay be merry and to morrow get you early on your way that thoumayest go home but the man would not tarry that night but he rose up anddeparted and came over against jebus which is jerusalem and therewere with him two asses saddled his concubine also was with him and when they were by jebus the day was far spent and theservant said unto his master come i pray thee and let us turn ininto this city of the jebusites and lodge in it and his master said unto him we will not turn aside hither intothe city of a stranger that is not of the children of israel we willpass over to gibeah and he said unto his servant come and let us draw near to oneof these places to lodge all night in gibeah or in ramah and they passed on and went their way and the sun went downupon them when they were by gibeah which belongeth to benjamin and they turned aside thither to go in and to lodge in gibeahand when he went in he sat him down in a street of the city forthere was no man that took them into his house to lodging and behold there came an old man from his work out of thefield at even which was also of mount ephraim and he sojourned ingibeah but the men of the place were benjamites and when he had lifted up his eyes he saw a wayfaring man inthe street of the city and the old man said whither goest thou andwhence comest thou   and he said unto him we are passing frombethlehemjudah toward the side of mount ephraim from thence am i andi went to bethlehemjudah but i am now going to the house of the lordand there is no man that receiveth me to house yet there is both straw and provender for our asses and thereis bread and wine also for me and for thy handmaid and for the youngman which is with thy servants there is no want of any thing and the old man said peace be with thee howsoever let all thywants lie upon me only lodge not in the street so he brought him into his house and gave provender unto theasses and they washed their feet and did eat and drink now as they were making their hearts merry behold the men ofthe city certain sons of belial beset the house round about andbeat at the door and spake to the master of the house the old mansaying bring forth the man that came into thine house that we mayknow him and the man the master of the house went out unto them andsaid unto them nay my brethren nay i pray you do not so wickedlyseeing that this man is come into mine house do not this folly behold here is my daughter a maiden and his concubine them iwill bring out now and humble ye them and do with them what seemethgood unto you but unto this man do not so vile a thing but the men would not hearken to him so the man took hisconcubine and brought her forth unto them and they knew her andabused her all the night until the morning and when the day began tospring they let her go then came the woman in the dawning of the day and fell down atthe door of the mans house where her lord was till it was light and her lord rose up in the morning and opened the doors of thehouse and went out to go his way and behold the woman hisconcubine was fallen down at the door of the house and her hands wereupon the threshold and he said unto her up and let us be going but noneansweredthen the man took her up upon an ass and the man rose up and gat himunto his place and when he was come into his house he took a knife and laidhold on his concubine and divided her together with her bones intotwelve pieces and sent her into all the coasts of israel and it was so that all that saw it said there was no such deeddone nor seen from the day that the children of israel came up out ofthe land of egypt unto this day consider of it take advice andspeak your minds then all the children of israel went out and the congregationwas gathered together as one man from dan even to beersheba with theland of gilead unto the lord in mizpeh and the chief of all the people even of all the tribes ofisrael presented themselves in the assembly of the people of godfour hundred thousand footmen that drew sword now the children of benjamin heard that the children of israelwere gone up to mizpeh then said the children of israel tell ushow was this wickedness   and the levite the husband of thewoman that was slain answered and said i came into gibeah thatbelongeth to benjamin i and my concubine to lodge and the men of gibeah rose against me and beset the house roundabout upon me by night and thought to have slain me and my concubinehave they forced that she is dead and i took my concubine and cut her in pieces and sent herthroughout all the country of the inheritance of israel for they havecommitted lewdness and folly in israel behold ye are all children of israel give here your advice andcounsel and all the people arose as one man saying we will not any ofus go to his tent neither will we any of us turn into his house but now this shall be the thing which we will do to gibeah wewill go up by lot against it  and we will take ten men of anhundred throughout all the tribes of israel and an hundred of athousand and a thousand out of ten thousand to fetch victual for thepeople that they may do when they come to gibeah of benjaminaccording to all the folly that they have wrought in israel so all the men of israel were gathered against the city knittogether as one man and the tribes of israel sent men through all the tribe ofbenjamin saying what wickedness is this that is done among you now therefore deliver us the men the children of belial whichare in gibeah that we may put them to death and put away evil fromisrael but the children of benjamin would not hearken to the voice oftheir brethren the children of israel but the children of benjamin gathered themselves together out ofthe cities unto gibeah to go out to battle against the children ofisrael and the children of benjamin were numbered at that time out ofthe cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword beside theinhabitants of gibeah which were numbered seven hundred chosen men among all this people there were seven hundred chosen menlefthanded every one could sling stones at an hair breadth and notmiss and the men of israel beside benjamin were numbered fourhundred thousand men that drew sword all these were men of war and the children of israel arose and went up to the house ofgod and asked counsel of god and said which of us shall go up firstto the battle against the children of benjamin and the lord saidjudah shall go up first and the children of israel rose up in the morning and encampedagainst gibeah and the men of israel went out to battle against benjamin andthe men of israel put themselves in array to fight against them atgibeah and the children of benjamin came forth out of gibeah anddestroyed down to the ground of the israelites that day twenty and twothousand men and the people the men of israel encouraged themselves and settheir battle again in array in the place where they put themselves inarray the first day and the children of israel went up and wept before the lorduntil even and asked counsel of the lord saying shall i go up againto battle against the children of benjamin my brother and the lordsaid go up against him   and the children of israel came nearagainst the children of benjamin the second day and benjamin went forth against them out of gibeah the secondday and destroyed down to the ground of the children of israel againeighteen thousand men all these drew the sword then all the children of israel and all the people went upand came unto the house of god and wept and sat there before thelord and fasted that day until even and offered burnt offerings andpeace offerings before the lord and the children of israel enquired of the lord for the ark ofthe covenant of god was there in those days  and phinehas theson of eleazar the son of aaron stood before it in those dayssaying shall i yet again go out to battle against the children ofbenjamin my brother or shall i cease and the lord said go up forto morrow i will deliver them into thine hand and israel set liers in wait round about gibeah and the children of israel went up against the children ofbenjamin on the third day and put themselves in array against gibeahas at other times and the children of benjamin went out against the people andwere drawn away from the city and they began to smite of the peopleand kill as at other times in the highways of which one goeth up tothe house of god and the other to gibeah in the field about thirtymen of israel and the children of benjamin said they are smitten down beforeus as at the first but the children of israel said let us flee anddraw them from the city unto the highways and all the men of israel rose up out of their place and putthemselves in array at baaltamar and the liers in wait of israel cameforth out of their places even out of the meadows of gibeah and there came against gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of allisrael and the battle was sore but they knew not that evil was nearthem and the lord smote benjamin before israel and the children ofisrael destroyed of the benjamites that day twenty and five thousandand an hundred men all these drew the sword so the children of benjamin saw that they were smitten for themen of israel gave place to the benjamites because they trusted untothe liers in wait which they had set beside gibeah and the liers in wait hasted and rushed upon gibeah and theliers in wait drew themselves along and smote all the city with theedge of the sword now there was an appointed sign between the men of israel andthe liers in wait that they should make a great flame with smoke riseup out of the city and when the men of israel retired in the battle benjamin beganto smite and kill of the men of israel about thirty persons for theysaid surely they are smitten down before us as in the first battle but when the flame began to arise up out of the city with apillar of smoke the benjamites looked behind them and behold theflame of the city ascended up to heaven and when the men of israel turned again the men of benjaminwere amazed for they saw that evil was come upon them therefore they turned their backs before the men of israel untothe way of the wilderness but the battle overtook them and themwhich came out of the cities they destroyed in the midst of them thus they inclosed the benjamites round about and chased themand trode them down with ease over against gibeah toward thesunrising and there fell of benjamin eighteen thousand men all these weremen of valour and they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock ofrimmon and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand menand pursued hard after them unto gidom and slew two thousand men ofthem so that all which fell that day of benjamin were twenty and fivethousand men that drew the sword all these were men of valour but six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness unto therock rimmon and abode in the rock rimmon four months and the men of israel turned again upon the children ofbenjamin and smote them with the edge of the sword as well the menof every city as the beast and all that came to hand also they seton fire all the cities that they came to now the men of israel had sworn in mizpeh saying there shallnot any of us give his daughter unto benjamin to wife and the people came to the house of god and abode there tilleven before god and lifted up their voices and wept sore  andsaid o lord god of israel why is this come to pass in israel thatthere should be to day one tribe lacking in israel   and it cameto pass on the morrow that the people rose early and built there analtar and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings and the children of israel said who is there among all thetribes of israel that came not up with the congregation unto the lordfor they had made a great oath concerning him that came not up to thelord to mizpeh saying he shall surely be put to death and the children of israel repented them for benjamin theirbrother and said there is one tribe cut off from israel this day how shall we do for wives for them that remain seeing we havesworn by the lord that we will not give them of our daughters towives   and they said what one is there of the tribes of israelthat came not up to mizpeh to the lord and behold there came noneto the camp from jabeshgilead to the assembly for the people were numbered and behold there were none of theinhabitants of jabeshgilead there and the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of thevaliantest and commanded them saying go and smite the inhabitantsof jabeshgilead with the edge of the sword with the women and thechildren and this is the thing that ye shall do ye shall utterly destroyevery male and every woman that hath lain by man and they found among the inhabitants of jabeshgilead fourhundred young virgins that had known no man by lying with any maleand they brought them unto the camp to shiloh which is in the land ofcanaan and the whole congregation sent some to speak to the children ofbenjamin that were in the rock rimmon and to call peaceably untothem and benjamin came again at that time and they gave them wiveswhich they had saved alive of the women of jabeshgilead and yet sothey sufficed them not and the people repented them for benjamin because that the lordhad made a breach in the tribes of israel then the elders of the congregation said how shall we do forwives for them that remain seeing the women are destroyed out ofbenjamin   and they said there must be an inheritance for themthat be escaped of benjamin that a tribe be not destroyed out ofisrael howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters for thechildren of israel have sworn saying cursed be he that giveth a wifeto benjamin then they said behold there is a feast of the lord in shilohyearly in a place which is on the north side of bethel on the eastside of the highway that goeth up from bethel to shechem and on thesouth of lebonah therefore they commanded the children of benjamin saying goand lie in wait in the vineyards  and see and behold if thedaughters of shiloh come out to dance in dances then come ye out ofthe vineyards and catch you every man his wife of the daughters ofshiloh and go to the land of benjamin and it shall be when their fathers or their brethren come untous to complain that we will say unto them be favourable unto themfor our sakes because we reserved not to each man his wife in thewar for ye did not give unto them at this time that ye should beguilty and the children of benjamin did so and took them wivesaccording to their number of them that danced whom they caught andthey went and returned unto their inheritance and repaired thecities and dwelt in them and the children of israel departed thence at that time everyman to his tribe and to his family and they went out from thenceevery man to his inheritance in those days there was no king in israel every man did thatwhich was right in his own eyesthe book of ruth now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled that therewas a famine in the land and a certain man of bethlehemjudah went tosojourn in the country of moab he and his wife and his two sons and the name of the man was elimelech and the name of his wifenaomi and the name of his two sons mahlon and chilion ephrathites ofbethlehemjudah and they came into the country of moab and continuedthere and elimelech naomis husband died and she was left and her twosons and they took them wives of the women of moab the name of the onewas orpah and the name of the other ruth and they dwelled thereabout ten years and mahlon and chilion died also both of them and the woman wasleft of her two sons and her husband then she arose with her daughters in law that she might returnfrom the country of moab for she had heard in the country of moab howthat the lord had visited his people in giving them bread wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was and hertwo daughters in law with her and they went on the way to return untothe land of judah and naomi said unto her two daughters in law go return each toher mothers house the lord deal kindly with you as ye have dealtwith the dead and with me the lord grant you that ye may find rest each of you in the houseof her husband then she kissed them and they lifted up their voiceand wept and they said unto her surely we will return with thee unto thypeople and naomi said turn again my daughters why will ye go with meare there yet any more sons in my womb that they may be yourhusbands   turn again my daughters go your way for i am tooold to have an husband if i should say i have hope if i should havean husband also to night and should also bear sons  would yetarry for them till they were grown would ye stay for them fromhaving husbands nay my daughters for it grieveth me much for yoursakes that the hand of the lord is gone out against me and they lifted up their voice and wept again and orpah kissedher mother in law but ruth clave unto her and she said behold thy sister in law is gone back unto herpeople and unto her gods return thou after thy sister in law and ruth said intreat me not to leave thee or to return fromfollowing after thee for whither thou goest i will go and wherethou lodgest i will lodge thy people shall be my people and thy godmy god  where thou diest will i die and there will i be buriedthe lord do so to me and more also if ought but death part thee andme when she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her thenshe left speaking unto her so they two went until they came to bethlehem and it came topass when they were come to bethlehem that all the city was movedabout them and they said is this naomi   and she said untothem call me not naomi call me mara for the almighty hath dealtvery bitterly with me i went out full and the lord hath brought me home again emptywhy then call ye me naomi seeing the lord hath testified against meand the almighty hath afflicted me   so naomi returned and ruththe moabitess her daughter in law with her which returned out ofthe country of moab and they came to bethlehem in the beginning ofbarley harvest and naomi had a kinsman of her husbands a mighty man of wealthof the family of elimelech and his name was boaz and ruth the moabitess said unto naomi let me now go to thefield and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight i shall findgraceand she said unto her go my daughter and she went and came and gleaned in the field after thereapers and her hap was to light on a part of the field belongingunto boaz who was of the kindred of elimelech and behold boaz came from bethlehem and said unto the reapersthe lord be with you and they answered him the lord bless thee then said boaz unto his servant that was set over the reaperswhose damsel is this   and the servant that was set over thereapers answered and said it is the moabitish damsel that came backwith naomi out of the country of moab  and she said i pray youlet me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves so shecame and hath continued even from the morning until now that shetarried a little in the house then said boaz unto ruth hearest thou not my daughter go not toglean in another field neither go from hence but abide here fast bymy maidens  let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap andgo thou after them have i not charged the young men that they shallnot touch thee and when thou art athirst go unto the vessels anddrink of that which the young men have drawn then she fell on her face and bowed herself to the ground andsaid unto him why have i found grace in thine eyes that thoushouldest take knowledge of me seeing i am a stranger   and boazanswered and said unto her it hath fully been shewed me all thatthou hast done unto thy mother in law since the death of thinehusband and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother and theland of thy nativity and art come unto a people which thou knewestnot heretofore the lord recompense thy work and a full reward be given thee ofthe lord god of israel under whose wings thou art come to trust then she said let me find favour in thy sight my lord for thatthou hast comforted me and for that thou hast spoken friendly untothine handmaid though i be not like unto one of thine handmaidens and boaz said unto her at mealtime come thou hither and eat ofthe bread and dip thy morsel in the vinegar and she sat beside thereapers and he reached her parched corn and she did eat and wassufficed and left and when she was risen up to glean boaz commanded his young mensaying let her glean even among the sheaves and reproach her not and let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her andleave them that she may glean them and rebuke her not so she gleaned in the field until even and beat out that she hadgleaned and it was about an ephah of barley and she took it up and went into the city and her mother in lawsaw what she had gleaned and she brought forth and gave to her thatshe had reserved after she was sufficed and her mother in law said unto her where hast thou gleaned today  and where wroughtest thou blessed be he that did take knowledgeof thee and she shewed her mother in law with whom she had wroughtand said the mans name with whom i wrought to day is boaz and naomi said unto her daughter in law blessed be he of thelord who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to thedead and naomi said unto her the man is near of kin unto us one ofour next kinsmen and ruth the moabitess said he said unto me also thou shaltkeep fast by my young men until they have ended all my harvest and naomi said unto ruth her daughter in law it is good mydaughter that thou go out with his maidens that they meet thee notin any other field so she kept fast by the maidens of boaz to glean unto the end ofbarley harvest and of wheat harvest and dwelt with her mother in law then naomi her mother in law said unto her my daughter shall inot seek rest for thee that it may be well with thee   and now isnot boaz of our kindred with whose maidens thou wast  behold hewinnoweth barley to night in the threshingfloor wash thyself therefore and anoint thee and put thy raiment uponthee and get thee down to the floor but make not thyself known untothe man until he shall have done eating and drinking and it shall be when he lieth down that thou shalt mark theplace where he shall lie and thou shalt go in and uncover his feetand lay thee down and he will tell thee what thou shalt do and she said unto her all that thou sayest unto me i will do and she went down unto the floor and did according to all thather mother in law bade her and when boaz had eaten and drunk and his heart was merry hewent to lie down at the end of the heap of corn and she came softlyand uncovered his feet and laid her down and it came to pass at midnight that the man was afraid andturned himself and behold a woman lay at his feet and he said who art thou and she answered i am ruth thinehandmaid spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid for thou arta near kinsman and he said blessed be thou of the lord my daughter for thouhast shewed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginninginasmuch as thou followedst not young men whether poor or rich and now my daughter fear not i will do to thee all that thourequirest for all the city of my people doth know that thou art avirtuous woman and now it is true that i am thy near kinsman howbeit there is akinsman nearer than i tarry this night and it shall be in the morning that if he willperform unto thee the part of a kinsman well let him do thekinsmans part but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to theethen will i do the part of a kinsman to thee as the lord liveth liedown until the morning and she lay at his feet until the morning and she rose up beforeone could know another and he said let it not be known that a womancame into the floor also he said bring the vail that thou hast upon thee and holditand when she held it he measured six measures of barley and laid iton her and she went into the city and when she came to her mother in law she said who art thoumy daughter and she told her all that the man had done to her and she said these six measures of barley gave he me for hesaid to me go not empty unto thy mother in law then said she sit still my daughter until thou know how thematter will fall for the man will not be in rest until he havefinished the thing this day then went boaz up to the gate and sat him down there andbehold the kinsman of whom boaz spake came by unto whom he said hosuch a one turn aside sit down here and he turned aside and satdown and he took ten men of the elders of the city and said sit yedown here and they sat down and he said unto the kinsman naomi that is come again out of thecountry of moab selleth a parcel of land which was our brotherelimelechs  and i thought to advertise thee saying buy itbefore the inhabitants and before the elders of my people if thouwilt redeem it redeem it but if thou wilt not redeem it then tellme that i may know for there is none to redeem it beside thee and iam after thee and he said i will redeem it then said boaz what day thou buyest the field of the hand ofnaomi thou must buy it also of ruth the moabitess the wife of thedead to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance and the kinsman said i cannot redeem it for myself lest i marmine own inheritance redeem thou my right to thyself for i cannotredeem it now this was the manner in former time in israel concerningredeeming and concerning changing for to confirm all things a manplucked off his shoe and gave it to his neighbour and this was atestimony in israel therefore the kinsman said unto boaz buy it for thee so he drewoff his shoe and boaz said unto the elders and unto all the people ye arewitnesses this day that i have bought all that was elimelechs andall that was chilions and mahlons of the hand of naomi moreover ruth the moabitess the wife of mahlon have i purchasedto be my wife to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritancethat the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren andfrom the gate of his place ye are witnesses this day and all the people that were in the gate and the elders saidwe are witnesses the lord make the woman that is come into thinehouse like rachel and like leah which two did build the house ofisrael and do thou worthily in ephratah and be famous in bethlehem and let thy house be like the house of pharez whom tamar bareunto judah of the seed which the lord shall give thee of this youngwoman so boaz took ruth and she was his wife and when he went in untoher the lord gave her conception and she bare a son and the women said unto naomi blessed be the lord which hathnot left thee this day without a kinsman that his name may be famousin israel and he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life and a nourisherof thine old age for thy daughter in law which loveth thee which isbetter to thee than seven sons hath born him and naomi took the child and laid it in her bosom and becamenurse unto it and the women her neighbours gave it a name saying there is ason born to naomi and they called his name obed he is the father ofjesse the father of david now these are the generations of pharez pharez begat hezron and hezron begat ram and ram begat amminadab  and amminadabbegat nahshon and nahshon begat salmon  and salmon begat boazand boaz begat obed  and obed begat jesse and jesse begat davidthe first book of samuelotherwise calledthe first book of the kings now there was a certain man of ramathaimzophim of mount ephraimand his name was elkanah the son of jeroham the son of elihu theson of tohu the son of zuph an ephrathite  and he had two wivesthe name of the one was hannah and the name of the other peninnahand peninnah had children but hannah had no children and this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and tosacrifice unto the lord of hosts in shiloh and the two sons of elihophni and phinehas the priests of the lord were there and when the time was that elkanah offered he gave to peninnahhis wife and to all her sons and her daughters portions  butunto hannah he gave a worthy portion for he loved hannah but thelord had shut up her womb and her adversary also provoked her sore for to make her fretbecause the lord had shut up her womb and as he did so year by year when she went up to the house ofthe lord so she provoked her therefore she wept and did not eat then said elkanah her husband to her hannah why weepest thouand why eatest thou not and why is thy heart grieved am not i betterto thee than ten sons   so hannah rose up after they had eaten inshiloh and after they had drunk now eli the priest sat upon a seatby a post of the temple of the lord and she was in bitterness of soul and prayed unto the lord andwept sore and she vowed a vow and said o lord of hosts if thou wiltindeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid and remember me andnot forget thine handmaid but wilt give unto thine handmaid a manchild then i will give him unto the lord all the days of his lifeand there shall no razor come upon his head and it came to pass as she continued praying before the lordthat eli marked her mouth now hannah she spake in her heart only her lips moved but hervoice was not heard therefore eli thought she had been drunken and eli said unto her how long wilt thou be drunken put awaythy wine from thee and hannah answered and said no my lord i am a woman of asorrowful spirit i have drunk neither wine nor strong drink but havepoured out my soul before the lord count not thine handmaid for a daughter of belial for out of theabundance of my complaint and grief have i spoken hitherto then eli answered and said go in peace and the god of israelgrant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him and she said let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight so thewoman went her way and did eat and her countenance was no more sad and they rose up in the morning early and worshipped before thelord and returned and came to their house to ramah and elkanah knewhannah his wife and the lord remembered her wherefore it came to pass when the time was come about afterhannah had conceived that she bare a son and called his name samuelsaying because i have asked him of the lord and the man elkanah and all his house went up to offer unto thelord the yearly sacrifice and his vow but hannah went not up for she said unto her husband i will notgo up until the child be weaned and then i will bring him that hemay appear before the lord and there abide for ever and elkanah her husband said unto her do what seemeth thee goodtarry until thou have weaned him only the lord establish his word sothe woman abode and gave her son suck until she weaned him and when she had weaned him she took him up with her with threebullocks and one ephah of flour and a bottle of wine and broughthim unto the house of the lord in shiloh and the child was young and they slew a bullock and brought the child to eli and she said oh my lord as thy soul liveth my lord i am thewoman that stood by thee here praying unto the lord for this child i prayed and the lord hath given me my petitionwhich i asked of him  therefore also i have lent him to the lordas long as he liveth he shall be lent to the lord and he worshippedthe lord there and hannah prayed and said my heart rejoiceth in the lord minehorn is exalted in the lord my mouth is enlarged over mine enemiesbecause i rejoice in thy salvation there is none holy as the lord for there is none beside theeneither is there any rock like our god talk no more so exceeding proudly let not arrogancy come out ofyour mouth for the lord is a god of knowledge and by him actions areweighed the bows of the mighty men are broken and they that stumbled aregirded with strength they that were full have hired out themselves for bread and theythat were hungry ceased so that the barren hath born seven and shethat hath many children is waxed feeble the lord killeth and maketh alive he bringeth down to the graveand bringeth up the lord maketh poor and maketh rich he bringeth low andlifteth up he raiseth up the poor out of the dust and lifteth up the beggarfrom the dunghill to set them among princes and to make them inheritthe throne of glory for the pillars of the earth are the lords andhe hath set the world upon them he will keep the feet of his saints and the wicked shall besilent in darkness for by strength shall no man prevail the adversaries of the lord shall be broken to pieces out ofheaven shall he thunder upon them the lord shall judge the ends ofthe earth and he shall give strength unto his king and exalt thehorn of his anointed and elkanah went to ramah to his house and the child didminister unto the lord before eli the priest now the sons of eli were sons of belial they knew not the lord and the priests custom with the people was that when any manoffered sacrifice the priests servant came while the flesh was inseething with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand  and hestruck it into the pan or kettle or caldron or pot all that thefleshhook brought up the priest took for himself so they did inshiloh unto all the israelites that came thither also before they burnt the fat the priests servant came andsaid to the man that sacrificed give flesh to roast for the priestfor he will not have sodden flesh of thee but raw and if any man said unto him let them not fail to burn the fatpresently and then take as much as thy soul desireth then he wouldanswer him nay but thou shalt give it me now and if not i willtake it by force wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before thelord for men abhorred the offering of the lord but samuel ministered before the lord being a child girded witha linen ephod moreover his mother made him a little coat and brought it to himfrom year to year when she came up with her husband to offer theyearly sacrifice and eli blessed elkanah and his wife and said the lord givethee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the lord andthey went unto their own home and the lord visited hannah so that she conceived and barethree sons and two daughters and the child samuel grew before thelord now eli was very old and heard all that his sons did unto allisrael and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door ofthe tabernacle of the congregation and he said unto them why do ye such things for i hear of yourevil dealings by all this people nay my sons for it is no good report that i hear ye make thelords people to transgress if one man sin against another the judge shall judge him but ifa man sin against the lord who shall intreat for him notwithstandingthey hearkened not unto the voice of their father because the lordwould slay them and the child samuel grew on and was in favour both with thelord and also with men and there came a man of god unto eli and said unto him thussaith the lord did i plainly appear unto the house of thy fatherwhen they were in egypt in pharaohs house   and did i choose himout of all the tribes of israel to be my priest to offer upon minealtar to burn incense to wear an ephod before me and did i giveunto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of thechildren of israel   wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and atmine offering which i have commanded in my habitation and honourestthy sons above me to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all theofferings of israel my people   wherefore the lord god of israelsaith i said indeed that thy house and the house of thy fathershould walk before me for ever but now the lord saith be it far fromme for them that honour me i will honour and they that despise meshall be lightly esteemed behold the days come that i will cut off thine arm and the armof thy fathers house that there shall not be an old man in thinehouse and thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation in all the wealthwhich god shall give israel and there shall not be an old man inthine house for ever and the man of thine whom i shall not cut off from mine altarshall be to consume thine eyes and to grieve thine heart and all theincrease of thine house shall die in the flower of their age and this shall be a sign unto thee that shall come upon thy twosons on hophni and phinehas in one day they shall die both of them and i will raise me up a faithful priest that shall do accordingto that which is in mine heart and in my mind and i will build him asure house and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever and it shall come to pass that every one that is left in thinehouse shall come and crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morselof bread and shall say put me i pray thee into one of the priestsoffices that i may eat a piece of bread and the child samuel ministered unto the lord before eli and theword of the lord was precious in those days there was no open vision and it came to pass at that time when eli was laid down in hisplace and his eyes began to wax dim that he could not see  andere the lamp of god went out in the temple of the lord where the arkof god was and samuel was laid down to sleep  that the lordcalled samuel and he answered here am i and he ran unto eli and said here am i for thou calledst meand he said i called not lie down again and he went and lay down and the lord called yet again samuel and samuel arose and wentto eli and said here am i for thou didst call me and he answeredi called not my son lie down again now samuel did not yet know the lord neither was the word of thelord yet revealed unto him and the lord called samuel again the third time and he arose andwent to eli and said here am i for thou didst call me and eliperceived that the lord had called the child therefore eli said unto samuel go lie down and it shall be ifhe call thee that thou shalt say speak lord for thy servantheareth so samuel went and lay down in his place and the lord came and stood and called as at other timessamuel samuel then samuel answered speak for thy servant heareth and the lord said to samuel behold i will do a thing in israelat which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle in that day i will perform against eli all things which i havespoken concerning his house when i begin i will also make an end for i have told him that i will judge his house for ever for theiniquity which he knoweth because his sons made themselves vile andhe restrained them not and therefore i have sworn unto the house of eli that theiniquity of elis house shall not be purged with sacrifice noroffering for ever and samuel lay until the morning and opened the doors of thehouse of the lord and samuel feared to shew eli the vision then eli called samuel and said samuel my son and heanswered here am i and he said what is the thing that the lord hath said unto theei pray thee hide it not from me god do so to thee and more also ifthou hide any thing from me of all the things that he said unto thee and samuel told him every whit and hid nothing from him and hesaid it is the lord let him do what seemeth him good and samuel grew and the lord was with him and did let none ofhis words fall to the ground and all israel from dan even to beersheba knew that samuel wasestablished to be a prophet of the lord and the lord appeared again in shiloh for the lord revealedhimself to samuel in shiloh by the word of the lord and the word of samuel came to all israel now israel went outagainst the philistines to battle and pitched beside ebenezer andthe philistines pitched in aphek and the philistines put themselves in array against israel andwhen they joined battle israel was smitten before the philistinesand they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men and when the people were come into the camp the elders of israelsaid wherefore hath the lord smitten us to day before thephilistines let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the lord out ofshiloh unto us that when it cometh among us it may save us out ofthe hand of our enemies so the people sent to shiloh that they might bring from thencethe ark of the covenant of the lord of hosts which dwelleth betweenthe cherubims and the two sons of eli hophni and phinehas werethere with the ark of the covenant of god and when the ark of the covenant of the lord came into the campall israel shouted with a great shout so that the earth rang again and when the philistines heard the noise of the shout they saidwhat meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the hebrewsand they understood that the ark of the lord was come into the camp and the philistines were afraid for they said god is come intothe camp and they said woe unto us for there hath not been such athing heretofore woe unto us who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mightygods these are the gods that smote the egyptians with all the plaguesin the wilderness be strong and quit yourselves like men o ye philistines that yebe not servants unto the hebrews as they have been to you quityourselves like men and fight and the philistines fought and israel was smitten and they fledevery man into his tent and there was a very great slaughter forthere fell of israel thirty thousand footmen and the ark of god was taken and the two sons of eli hophni andphinehas were slain and there ran a man of benjamin out of the army and came toshiloh the same day with his clothes rent and with earth upon hishead and when he came lo eli sat upon a seat by the waysidewatching for his heart trembled for the ark of god and when the mancame into the city and told it all the city cried out and when eli heard the noise of the crying he said what meaneththe noise of this tumult and the man came in hastily and told eli now eli was ninety and eight years old and his eyes were dimthat he could not see and the man said unto eli i am he that came out of the army andi fled to day out of the army and he said what is there done myson   and the messenger answered and said israel is fled beforethe philistines and there hath been also a great slaughter among thepeople and thy two sons also hophni and phinehas are dead and theark of god is taken and it came to pass when he made mention of the ark of god thathe fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate and hisneck brake and he died for he was an old man and heavy and he hadjudged israel forty years and his daughter in law phinehas wife was with child near tobe delivered and when she heard the tidings that the ark of god wastaken and that her father in law and her husband were dead she bowedherself and travailed for her pains came upon her and about the time of her death the women that stood by her saidunto her fear not for thou hast born a son but she answered notneither did she regard it and she named the child ichabod saying the glory is departedfrom israel because the ark of god was taken and because of herfather in law and her husband and she said the glory is departed from israel for the ark ofgod is taken and the philistines took the ark of god and brought it fromebenezer unto ashdod when the philistines took the ark of god they brought it into thehouse of dagon and set it by dagon and when they of ashdod arose early on the morrow behold dagonwas fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of the lord andthey took dagon and set him in his place again and when they arose early on the morrow morning behold dagon wasfallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the lord and thehead of dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off upon thethreshold only the stump of dagon was left to him therefore neither the priests of dagon nor any that come intodagons house tread on the threshold of dagon in ashdod unto thisday but the hand of the lord was heavy upon them of ashdod and hedestroyed them and smote them with emerods even ashdod and thecoasts thereof and when the men of ashdod saw that it was so they said the arkof the god of israel shall not abide with us for his hand is soreupon us and upon dagon our god they sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the philistinesunto them and said what shall we do with the ark of the god ofisrael and they answered let the ark of the god of israel be carriedabout unto gath and they carried the ark of the god of israel aboutthither and it was so that after they had carried it about the hand ofthe lord was against the city with a very great destruction and hesmote the men of the city both small and great and they had emerodsin their secret parts therefore they sent the ark of god to ekron and it came to passas the ark of god came to ekron that the ekronites cried out sayingthey have brought about the ark of the god of israel to us to slay usand our people so they sent and gathered together all the lords of thephilistines and said send away the ark of the god of israel and letit go again to his own place that it slay us not and our people forthere was a deadly destruction throughout all the city the hand ofgod was very heavy there and the men that died not were smitten with the emerods and thecry of the city went up to heaven and the ark of the lord was in the country of the philistinesseven months and the philistines called for the priests and the divinerssaying what shall we do to the ark of the lord tell us wherewith weshall send it to his place and they said if ye send away the ark of the god of israel sendit not empty but in any wise return him a trespass offering then yeshall be healed and it shall be known to you why his hand is notremoved from you then said they what shall be the trespass offering which we shallreturn to him they answered five golden emerods and five goldenmice according to the number of the lords of the philistines for oneplague was on you all and on your lords wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods and images of yourmice that mar the land and ye shall give glory unto the god ofisrael peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you and fromoff your gods and from off your land wherefore then do ye harden your hearts as the egyptians andpharaoh hardened their hearts when he had wrought wonderfully amongthem did they not let the people go and they departed   nowtherefore make a new cart and take two milch kine on which therehath come no yoke and tie the kine to the cart and bring theircalves home from them  and take the ark of the lord and lay itupon the cart and put the jewels of gold which ye return him for atrespass offering in a coffer by the side thereof and send it awaythat it may go and see if it goeth up by the way of his own coast tobethshemesh then he hath done us this great evil but if not then weshall know that it is not his hand that smote us it was a chance thathappened to us and the men did so and took two milch kine and tied them to thecart and shut up their calves at home  and they laid the ark ofthe lord upon the cart and the coffer with the mice of gold and theimages of their emerods and the kine took the straight way to the way of bethshemesh andwent along the highway lowing as they went and turned not aside tothe right hand or to the left and the lords of the philistines wentafter them unto the border of bethshemesh and they of bethshemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in thevalley and they lifted up their eyes and saw the ark and rejoicedto see it and the cart came into the field of joshua a bethshemite andstood there where there was a great stone and they clave the wood ofthe cart and offered the kine a burnt offering unto the lord and the levites took down the ark of the lord and the cofferthat was with it wherein the jewels of gold were and put them on thegreat stone and the men of bethshemesh offered burnt offerings andsacrificed sacrifices the same day unto the lord and when the five lords of the philistines had seen it theyreturned to ekron the same day and these are the golden emerods which the philistines returnedfor a trespass offering unto the lord for ashdod one for gaza onefor askelon one for gath one for ekron one  and the goldenmice according to the number of all the cities of the philistinesbelonging to the five lords both of fenced cities and of countryvillages even unto the great stone of abel whereon they set down theark of the lord which stone remaineth unto this day in the field ofjoshua the bethshemite and he smote the men of bethshemesh because they had looked intothe ark of the lord even he smote of the people fifty thousand andthreescore and ten men and the people lamented because the lord hadsmitten many of the people with a great slaughter and the men of bethshemesh said who is able to stand before thisholy lord god and to whom shall he go up from us   and they sentmessengers to the inhabitants of kirjathjearim saying thephilistines have brought again the ark of the lord come ye down andfetch it up to you and the men of kirjathjearim came and fetched up the ark of thelord and brought it into the house of abinadab in the hill andsanctified eleazar his son to keep the ark of the lord and it came to pass while the ark abode in kirjathjearim thatthe time was long for it was twenty years and all the house ofisrael lamented after the lord and samuel spake unto all the house of israel saying if ye doreturn unto the lord with all your hearts then put away the strangegods and ashtaroth from among you and prepare your hearts unto thelord and serve him only and he will deliver you out of the hand ofthe philistines then the children of israel did put away baalim and ashtaroth andserved the lord only and samuel said gather all israel to mizpeh and i will pray foryou unto the lord and they gathered together to mizpeh and drew water and pouredit out before the lord and fasted on that day and said there wehave sinned against the lord and samuel judged the children of israelin mizpeh and when the philistines heard that the children of israel weregathered together to mizpeh the lords of the philistines went upagainst israel and when the children of israel heard it they wereafraid of the philistines and the children of israel said to samuel cease not to cry untothe lord our god for us that he will save us out of the hand of thephilistines and samuel took a sucking lamb and offered it for a burntoffering wholly unto the lord and samuel cried unto the lord forisrael and the lord heard him and as samuel was offering up the burnt offering the philistinesdrew near to battle against israel but the lord thundered with agreat thunder on that day upon the philistines and discomfited themand they were smitten before israel and the men of israel went out of mizpeh and pursued thephilistines and smote them until they came under bethcar then samuel took a stone and set it between mizpeh and shen andcalled the name of it ebenezer saying hitherto hath the lord helpedus so the philistines were subdued and they came no more into thecoast of israel and the hand of the lord was against the philistinesall the days of samuel and the cities which the philistines had taken from israel wererestored to israel from ekron even unto gath and the coasts thereofdid israel deliver out of the hands of the philistines and there waspeace between israel and the amorites and samuel judged israel all the days of his life and he went from year to year in circuit to bethel and gilgaland mizpeh and judged israel in all those places and his return was to ramah for there was his house and therehe judged israel and there he built an altar unto the lord and it came to pass when samuel was old that he made his sonsjudges over israel now the name of his firstborn was joel and the name of hissecond abiah they were judges in beersheba and his sons walked not in his ways but turned aside after lucreand took bribes and perverted judgment then all the elders of israel gathered themselves together andcame to samuel unto ramah  and said unto him behold thou artold and thy sons walk not in thy ways now make us a king to judge uslike all the nations but the thing displeased samuel when they said give us a king tojudge us and samuel prayed unto the lord and the lord said unto samuel hearken unto the voice of thepeople in all that they say unto thee for they have not rejectedthee but they have rejected me that i should not reign over them according to all the works which they have done since the day thati brought them up out of egypt even unto this day wherewith they haveforsaken me and served other gods so do they also unto thee now therefore hearken unto their voice howbeit yet protestsolemnly unto them and shew them the manner of the king that shallreign over them and samuel told all the words of the lord unto the people thatasked of him a king and he said this will be the manner of the king that shall reignover you he will take your sons and appoint them for himself forhis chariots and to be his horsemen and some shall run before hischariots and he will appoint him captains over thousands and captainsover fifties and will set them to ear his ground and to reap hisharvest and to make his instruments of war and instruments of hischariots and he will take your daughters to be confectionaries and to becooks and to be bakers and he will take your fields and your vineyards and youroliveyards even the best of them and give them to his servants and he will take the tenth of your seed and of your vineyardsand give to his officers and to his servants and he will take your menservants and your maidservants andyour goodliest young men and your asses and put them to his work he will take the tenth of your sheep and ye shall be hisservants and ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which yeshall have chosen you and the lord will not hear you in that day nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of samuel andthey said nay but we will have a king over us  that we also maybe like all the nations and that our king may judge us and go outbefore us and fight our battles and samuel heard all the words of the people and he rehearsedthem in the ears of the lord and the lord said to samuel hearken unto their voice and makethem a king and samuel said unto the men of israel go ye every manunto his city now there was a man of benjamin whose name was kish the son ofabiel the son of zeror the son of bechorath the son of aphiah abenjamite a mighty man of power and he had a son whose name was saul a choice young man and agoodly and there was not among the children of israel a goodlierperson than he from his shoulders and upward he was higher than anyof the people and the asses of kish sauls father were lost and kish said tosaul his son take now one of the servants with thee and arise goseek the asses and he passed through mount ephraim and passed through the landof shalisha but they found them not then they passed through theland of shalim and there they were not and he passed through theland of the benjamites but they found them not and when they were come to the land of zuph saul said to hisservant that was with him come and let us return lest my fatherleave caring for the asses and take thought for us and he said unto him behold now there is in this city a man ofgod and he is an honourable man all that he saith cometh surely topass now let us go thither peradventure he can shew us our way thatwe should go then said saul to his servant but behold if we go what shallwe bring the man for the bread is spent in our vessels and there isnot a present to bring to the man of god what have we   and theservant answered saul again and said behold i have here at hand thefourth part of a shekel of silver that will i give to the man of godto tell us our way beforetime in israel when a man went to enquire of god thus hespake come and let us go to the seer for he that is now called aprophet was beforetime called a seer   then said saul to hisservant well said come let us go so they went unto the city wherethe man of god was and as they went up the hill to the city they found youngmaidens going out to draw water and said unto them is the seer here and they answered them and said he is behold he is beforeyou make haste now for he came to day to the city for there is asacrifice of the people to day in the high place  as soon as yebe come into the city ye shall straightway find him before he go upto the high place to eat for the people will not eat until he comebecause he doth bless the sacrifice and afterwards they eat that bebidden now therefore get you up for about this time ye shall findhim and they went up into the city and when they were come into thecity behold samuel came out against them for to go up to the highplace now the lord had told samuel in his ear a day before saul camesaying  to morrow about this time i will send thee a man out ofthe land of benjamin and thou shalt anoint him to be captain over mypeople israel that he may save my people out of the hand of thephilistines for i have looked upon my people because their cry iscome unto me and when samuel saw saul the lord said unto him behold the manwhom i spake to thee of this same shall reign over my people then saul drew near to samuel in the gate and said tell me ipray thee where the seers house is and samuel answered saul and said i am the seer go up beforeme unto the high place for ye shall eat with me to day and to morrowi will let thee go and will tell thee all that is in thine heart and as for thine asses that were lost three days ago set not thymind on them for they are found and on whom is all the desire ofisrael is it not on thee and on all thy fathers house   andsaul answered and said am not i a benjamite of the smallest of thetribes of israel and my family the least of all the families of thetribe of benjamin wherefore then speakest thou so to me   andsamuel took saul and his servant and brought them into the parlourand made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were biddenwhich were about thirty persons and samuel said unto the cook bring the portion which i gavethee of which i said unto thee set it by thee and the cook took up the shoulder and that which was upon itand set it before saul and samuel said behold that which is leftset it before thee and eat for unto this time hath it been kept forthee since i said i have invited the people so saul did eat withsamuel that day and when they were come down from the high place into the citysamuel communed with saul upon the top of the house and they arose early and it came to pass about the spring of theday that samuel called saul to the top of the house saying up thati may send thee away and saul arose and they went out both of themhe and samuel abroad and as they were going down to the end of the city samuel saidto saul bid the servant pass on before us and he passed on butstand thou still a while that i may shew thee the word of god then samuel took a vial of oil and poured it upon his head andkissed him and said is it not because the lord hath anointed thee tobe captain over his inheritance   when thou art departed from meto day then thou shalt find two men by rachels sepulchre in theborder of benjamin at zelzah and they will say unto thee the asseswhich thou wentest to seek are found and lo thy father hath leftthe care of the asses and sorroweth for you saying what shall i dofor my son   then shalt thou go on forward from thence and thoushalt come to the plain of tabor and there shall meet thee three mengoing up to god to bethel one carrying three kids and anothercarrying three loaves of bread and another carrying a bottle of wine and they will salute thee and give thee two loaves of breadwhich thou shalt receive of their hands after that thou shalt come to the hill of god where is thegarrison of the philistines and it shall come to pass when thou artcome thither to the city that thou shalt meet a company of prophetscoming down from the high place with a psaltery and a tabret and apipe and a harp before them and they shall prophesy  and thespirit of the lord will come upon thee and thou shalt prophesy withthem and shalt be turned into another man and let it be when these signs are come unto thee that thou doas occasion serve thee for god is with thee and thou shalt go down before me to gilgal and behold i willcome down unto thee to offer burnt offerings and to sacrificesacrifices of peace offerings seven days shalt thou tarry till icome to thee and shew thee what thou shalt do and it was so that when he had turned his back to go fromsamuel god gave him another heart and all those signs came to passthat day and when they came thither to the hill behold a company ofprophets met him and the spirit of god came upon him and heprophesied among them and it came to pass when all that knew him beforetime saw thatbehold he prophesied among the prophets then the people said one toanother what is this that is come unto the son of kish is saul alsoamong the prophets   and one of the same place answered andsaid but who is their father therefore it became a proverb is saulalso among the prophets   and when he had made an end ofprophesying he came to the high place and sauls uncle said unto him and to his servant whither wentye  and he said to seek the asses and when we saw that they were nowhere we came to samuel and sauls uncle said tell me i pray thee what samuel saidunto you and saul said unto his uncle he told us plainly that the asseswere found but of the matter of the kingdom whereof samuel spake hetold him not and samuel called the people together unto the lord to mizpeh and said unto the children of israel thus saith the lord god ofisrael i brought up israel out of egypt and delivered you out of thehand of the egyptians and out of the hand of all kingdoms and ofthem that oppressed you  and ye have this day rejected your godwho himself saved you out of all your adversities and yourtribulations and ye have said unto him nay but set a king over usnow therefore present yourselves before the lord by your tribes andby your thousands and when samuel had caused all the tribes of israel to comenear the tribe of benjamin was taken when he had caused the tribe of benjamin to come near by theirfamilies the family of matri was taken and saul the son of kish wastaken and when they sought him he could not be found therefore they enquired of the lord further if the man shouldyet come thither and the lord answered behold he hath hid himselfamong the stuff and they ran and fetched him thence and when he stood among thepeople he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders andupward and samuel said to all the people see ye him whom the lord hathchosen that there is none like him among all the people and all thepeople shouted and said god save the king then samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom and wroteit in a book and laid it up before the lord and samuel sent all thepeople away every man to his house and saul also went home to gibeah and there went with him aband of men whose hearts god had touched but the children of belial said how shall this man save us andthey despised him and brought no presents but he held his peace then nahash the ammonite came up and encamped againstjabeshgilead and all the men of jabesh said unto nahash make acovenant with us and we will serve thee and nahash the ammonite answered them on this condition will imake a covenant with you that i may thrust out all your right eyesand lay it for a reproach upon all israel and the elders of jabesh said unto him give us seven daysrespite that we may send messengers unto all the coasts of israeland then if there be no man to save us we will come out to thee then came the messengers to gibeah of saul and told the tidingsin the ears of the people and all the people lifted up their voicesand wept and behold saul came after the herd out of the field and saulsaid what aileth the people that they weep and they told him thetidings of the men of jabesh and the spirit of god came upon saul when he heard those tidingsand his anger was kindled greatly and he took a yoke of oxen and hewed them in pieces and sentthem throughout all the coasts of israel by the hands of messengerssaying whosoever cometh not forth after saul and after samuel soshall it be done unto his oxen and the fear of the lord fell on thepeople and they came out with one consent and when he numbered them in bezek the children of israel werethree hundred thousand and the men of judah thirty thousand and they said unto the messengers that came thus shall ye sayunto the men of jabeshgilead to morrow by that time the sun be hotye shall have help and the messengers came and shewed it to the menof jabesh and they were glad therefore the men of jabesh said to morrow we will come outunto you and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you and it was so on the morrow that saul put the people in threecompanies and they came into the midst of the host in the morningwatch and slew the ammonites until the heat of the day and it cameto pass that they which remained were scattered so that two of themwere not left together and the people said unto samuel who is he that said shall saulreign over us bring the men that we may put them to death and saul said there shall not a man be put to death this dayfor to day the lord hath wrought salvation in israel then said samuel to the people come and let us go to gilgaland renew the kingdom there and all the people went to gilgal and there they made saul kingbefore the lord in gilgal and there they sacrificed sacrifices ofpeace offerings before the lord and there saul and all the men ofisrael rejoiced greatly and samuel said unto all israel behold i have hearkened untoyour voice in all that ye said unto me and have made a king over you and now behold the king walketh before you and i am old andgrayheaded and behold my sons are with you and i have walkedbefore you from my childhood unto this day behold here i am witness against me before the lord and beforehis anointed whose ox have i taken or whose ass have i taken orwhom have i defrauded whom have i oppressed or of whose hand have ireceived any bribe to blind mine eyes therewith and i will restore ityou and they said thou hast not defrauded us nor oppressed usneither hast thou taken ought of any mans hand and he said unto them the lord is witness against you and hisanointed is witness this day that ye have not found ought in my handand they answered he is witness and samuel said unto the people it is the lord that advancedmoses and aaron and that brought your fathers up out of the land ofegypt now therefore stand still that i may reason with you before thelord of all the righteous acts of the lord which he did to you and toyour fathers when jacob was come into egypt and your fathers cried unto thelord then the lord sent moses and aaron which brought forth yourfathers out of egypt and made them dwell in this place and when they forgat the lord their god he sold them into thehand of sisera captain of the host of hazor and into the hand of thephilistines and into the hand of the king of moab and they foughtagainst them and they cried unto the lord and said we have sinned becausewe have forsaken the lord and have served baalim and ashtaroth butnow deliver us out of the hand of our enemies and we will serve thee and the lord sent jerubbaal and bedan and jephthah andsamuel and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on everyside and ye dwelled safe and when ye saw that nahash the king of the children of ammoncame against you ye said unto me nay but a king shall reign overus when the lord your god was your king now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen and whom yehave desired and behold the lord hath set a king over you if ye will fear the lord and serve him and obey his voice andnot rebel against the commandment of the lord then shall both ye andalso the king that reigneth over you continue following the lord yourgod  but if ye will not obey the voice of the lord but rebelagainst the commandment of the lord then shall the hand of the lordbe against you as it was against your fathers now therefore stand and see this great thing which the lordwill do before your eyes is it not wheat harvest to day i will call unto the lord andhe shall send thunder and rain that ye may perceive and see that yourwickedness is great which ye have done in the sight of the lord inasking you a king so samuel called unto the lord and the lord sent thunder andrain that day and all the people greatly feared the lord and samuel and all the people said unto samuel pray for thy servants untothe lord thy god that we die not for we have added unto all our sinsthis evil to ask us a king and samuel said unto the people fear not ye have done all thiswickedness yet turn not aside from following the lord but serve thelord with all your heart  and turn ye not aside for then shouldye go after vain things which cannot profit nor deliver for they arevain for the lord will not forsake his people for his great namessake because it hath pleased the lord to make you his people moreover as for me god forbid that i should sin against thelord in ceasing to pray for you but i will teach you the good and theright way  only fear the lord and serve him in truth with allyour heart for consider how great things he hath done for you but if ye shall still do wickedly ye shall be consumed both yeand your king saul reigned one year and when he had reigned two years overisrael  saul chose him three thousand men of israel whereof twothousand were with saul in michmash and in mount bethel and athousand were with jonathan in gibeah of benjamin and the rest of thepeople he sent every man to his tent and jonathan smote the garrison of the philistines that was ingeba and the philistines heard of it and saul blew the trumpetthroughout all the land saying let the hebrews hear and all israel heard say that saul had smitten a garrison of thephilistines and that israel also was had in abomination with thephilistines and the people were called together after saul to gilgal and the philistines gathered themselves together to fight withisrael thirty thousand chariots and six thousand horsemen andpeople as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude and theycame up and pitched in michmash eastward from bethaven when the men of israel saw that they were in a strait for thepeople were distressed then the people did hide themselves in cavesand in thickets and in rocks and in high places and in pits and some of the hebrews went over jordan to the land of gad andgilead as for saul he was yet in gilgal and all the people followedhim trembling and he tarried seven days according to the set time that samuelhad appointed but samuel came not to gilgal and the people werescattered from him and saul said bring hither a burnt offering to me and peaceofferings and he offered the burnt offering and it came to pass that as soon as he had made an end ofoffering the burnt offering behold samuel came and saul went out tomeet him that he might salute him and samuel said what hast thou done and saul said because isaw that the people were scattered from me and that thou camest notwithin the days appointed and that the philistines gatheredthemselves together at michmash  therefore said i thephilistines will come down now upon me to gilgal and i have not madesupplication unto the lord i forced myself therefore and offered aburnt offering and samuel said to saul thou hast done foolishly thou hast notkept the commandment of the lord thy god which he commanded thee fornow would the lord have established thy kingdom upon israel for ever but now thy kingdom shall not continue the lord hath sought hima man after his own heart and the lord hath commanded him to becaptain over his people because thou hast not kept that which thelord commanded thee and samuel arose and gat him up from gilgal unto gibeah ofbenjamin and saul numbered the people that were present with himabout six hundred men and saul and jonathan his son and the people that were presentwith them abode in gibeah of benjamin but the philistines encampedin michmash and the spoilers came out of the camp of the philistines inthree companies one company turned unto the way that leadeth toophrah unto the land of shual  and another company turned theway to bethhoron and another company turned to the way of the borderthat looketh to the valley of zeboim toward the wilderness now there was no smith found throughout all the land of israelfor the philistines said lest the hebrews make them swords or spears but all the israelites went down to the philistines to sharpenevery man his share and his coulter and his axe and his mattock yet they had a file for the mattocks and for the coulters andfor the forks and for the axes and to sharpen the goads so it came to pass in the day of battle that there was neithersword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were withsaul and jonathan but with saul and with jonathan his son was therefound and the garrison of the philistines went out to the passage ofmichmash now it came to pass upon a day that jonathan the son of saulsaid unto the young man that bare his armour come and let us go overto the philistines garrison that is on the other side but he toldnot his father and saul tarried in the uttermost part of gibeah under apomegranate tree which is in migron and the people that were with himwere about six hundred men  and ahiah the son of ahitubichabods brother the son of phinehas the son of eli the lordspriest in shiloh wearing an ephod and the people knew not thatjonathan was gone and between the passages by which jonathan sought to go overunto the philistines garrison there was a sharp rock on the oneside and a sharp rock on the other side and the name of the one wasbozez and the name of the other seneh the forefront of the one was situate northward over againstmichmash and the other southward over against gibeah and jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour comeand let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised it may bethat the lord will work for us for there is no restraint to the lordto save by many or by few and his armourbearer said unto him do all that is in thineheart turn thee behold i am with thee according to thy heart then said jonathan behold we will pass over unto these men andwe will discover ourselves unto them if they say thus unto us tarry until we come to you then wewill stand still in our place and will not go up unto them but if they say thus come up unto us then we will go up forthe lord hath delivered them into our hand and this shall be a signunto us and both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of thephilistines and the philistines said behold the hebrews come forthout of the holes where they had hid themselves and the men of the garrison answered jonathan and hisarmourbearer and said come up to us and we will shew you a thingand jonathan said unto his armourbearer come up after me for thelord hath delivered them into the hand of israel and jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet andhis armourbearer after him and they fell before jonathan and hisarmourbearer slew after him and that first slaughter which jonathan and his armourbearermade was about twenty men within as it were an half acre of landwhich a yoke of oxen might plow and there was trembling in the host in the field and among allthe people the garrison and the spoilers they also trembled andthe earth quaked so it was a very great trembling and the watchmen of saul in gibeah of benjamin looked andbehold the multitude melted away and they went on beating down oneanother then said saul unto the people that were with him number nowand see who is gone from us and when they had numbered beholdjonathan and his armourbearer were not there and saul said unto ahiah bring hither the ark of god for theark of god was at that time with the children of israel and it came to pass while saul talked unto the priest that thenoise that was in the host of the philistines went on and increasedand saul said unto the priest withdraw thine hand and saul and all the people that were with him assembledthemselves and they came to the battle and behold every manssword was against his fellow and there was a very great discomfiture moreover the hebrews that were with the philistines before thattime which went up with them into the camp from the country roundabout even they also turned to be with the israelites that were withsaul and jonathan likewise all the men of israel which had hid themselves in mountephraim when they heard that the philistines fled even they alsofollowed hard after them in the battle so the lord saved israel that day and the battle passed overunto bethaven and the men of israel were distressed that day for saul hadadjured the people saying cursed be the man that eateth any fooduntil evening that i may be avenged on mine enemies so none of thepeople tasted any food and all they of the land came to a wood and there was honeyupon the ground and when the people were come into the wood behold the honeydropped but no man put his hand to his mouth for the people fearedthe oath but jonathan heard not when his father charged the people withthe oath wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in hishand and dipped it in an honeycomb and put his hand to his mouthand his eyes were enlightened then answered one of the people and said thy father straitlycharged the people with an oath saying cursed be the man that eatethany food this day and the people were faint then said jonathan my father hath troubled the land see ipray you how mine eyes have been enlightened because i tasted alittle of this honey how much more if haply the people had eaten freely to day ofthe spoil of their enemies which they found for had there not beennow a much greater slaughter among the philistines   and theysmote the philistines that day from michmash to aijalon and thepeople were very faint and the people flew upon the spoil and took sheep and oxenand calves and slew them on the ground and the people did eat themwith the blood then they told saul saying behold the people sin against thelord in that they eat with the blood and he said ye havetransgressed roll a great stone unto me this day and saul said disperse yourselves among the people and sayunto them bring me hither every man his ox and every man his sheepand slay them here and eat and sin not against the lord in eatingwith the bloodand all the people brought every man his ox with him that night andslew them there and saul built an altar unto the lord the same was the firstaltar that he built unto the lord and saul said let us go down after the philistines by nightand spoil them until the morning light and let us not leave a man ofthem and they said do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee then saidthe priest let us draw near hither unto god and saul asked counsel of god shall i go down after thephilistines wilt thou deliver them into the hand of israel but heanswered him not that day and saul said draw ye near hither all the chief of the peopleand know and see wherein this sin hath been this day for as the lord liveth which saveth israel though it be injonathan my son he shall surely die but there was not a man amongall the people that answered him then said he unto all israel be ye on one side and i andjonathan my son will be on the other side and the people said untosaul do what seemeth good unto thee therefore saul said unto the lord god of israel give a perfectlotand saul and jonathan were taken but the people escaped and saul said cast lots between me and jonathan my son andjonathan was taken then saul said to jonathan tell me what thou hast done andjonathan told him and said i did but taste a little honey with theend of the rod that was in mine hand and lo i must die and saul answered god do so and more also for thou shaltsurely die jonathan and the people said unto saul shall jonathan die who hathwrought this great salvation in israel god forbid as the lordliveth there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground forhe hath wrought with god this day so the people rescued jonathanthat he died not then saul went up from following the philistines and thephilistines went to their own place so saul took the kingdom over israel and fought against all hisenemies on every side against moab and against the children ofammon and against edom and against the kings of zobah and againstthe philistines and whithersoever he turned himself he vexed them and he gathered an host and smote the amalekites and deliveredisrael out of the hands of them that spoiled them now the sons of saul were jonathan and ishui and melchishuaand the names of his two daughters were these the name of thefirstborn merab and the name of the younger michal  and thename of sauls wife was ahinoam the daughter of ahimaaz and the nameof the captain of his host was abner the son of ner sauls uncle and kish was the father of saul and ner the father of abner wasthe son of abiel and there was sore war against the philistines all the days ofsaul and when saul saw any strong man or any valiant man he tookhim unto him samuel also said unto saul the lord sent me to anoint thee to beking over his people over israel now therefore hearken thou unto thevoice of the words of the lord thus saith the lord of hosts i remember that which amalek did toisrael how he laid wait for him in the way when he came up fromegypt now go and smite amalek and utterly destroy all that they haveand spare them not but slay both man and woman infant and sucklingox and sheep camel and ass and saul gathered the people together and numbered them intelaim two hundred thousand footmen and ten thousand men of judah and saul came to a city of amalek and laid wait in the valley and saul said unto the kenites go depart get you down fromamong the amalekites lest i destroy you with them for ye shewedkindness to all the children of israel when they came up out ofegypt so the kenites departed from among the amalekites and saul smote the amalekites from havilah until thou comest toshur that is over against egypt and he took agag the king of the amalekites alive and utterlydestroyed all the people with the edge of the sword but saul and the people spared agag and the best of the sheepand of the oxen and of the fatlings and the lambs and all that wasgood and would not utterly destroy them but every thing that wasvile and refuse that they destroyed utterly then came the word of the lord unto samuel saying  itrepenteth me that i have set up saul to be king for he is turned backfrom following me and hath not performed my commandments and itgrieved samuel and he cried unto the lord all night and when samuel rose early to meet saul in the morning it wastold samuel saying saul came to carmel and behold he set him up aplace and is gone about and passed on and gone down to gilgal and samuel came to saul and saul said unto him blessed be thouof the lord i have performed the commandment of the lord and samuel said what meaneth then this bleating of the sheep inmine ears and the lowing of the oxen which i hear   and saulsaid they have brought them from the amalekites for the peoplespared the best of the sheep and of the oxen to sacrifice unto thelord thy god and the rest we have utterly destroyed then samuel said unto saul stay and i will tell thee what thelord hath said to me this night and he said unto him say on and samuel said when thou wast little in thine own sight wastthou not made the head of the tribes of israel and the lord anointedthee king over israel   and the lord sent thee on a journey andsaid go and utterly destroy the sinners the amalekites and fightagainst them until they be consumed wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the lord butdidst fly upon the spoil and didst evil in the sight of the lord and saul said unto samuel yea i have obeyed the voice of thelord and have gone the way which the lord sent me and have broughtagag the king of amalek and have utterly destroyed the amalekites but the people took of the spoil sheep and oxen the chief ofthe things which should have been utterly destroyed to sacrifice untothe lord thy god in gilgal and samuel said hath the lord as great delight in burntofferings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the lord beholdto obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of rams for rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft and stubbornness isas iniquity and idolatry because thou hast rejected the word of thelord he hath also rejected thee from being king and saul said unto samuel i have sinned for i havetransgressed the commandment of the lord and thy words because ifeared the people and obeyed their voice now therefore i pray thee pardon my sin and turn again withme that i may worship the lord and samuel said unto saul i will not return with thee for thouhast rejected the word of the lord and the lord hath rejected theefrom being king over israel and as samuel turned about to go away he laid hold upon theskirt of his mantle and it rent and samuel said unto him the lord hath rent the kingdom ofisrael from thee this day and hath given it to a neighbour of thinethat is better than thou and also the strength of israel will not lie nor repent for heis not a man that he should repent then he said i have sinned yet honour me now i pray theebefore the elders of my people and before israel and turn again withme that i may worship the lord thy god so samuel turned again after saul and saul worshipped the lord then said samuel bring ye hither to me agag the king of theamalekites and agag came unto him delicately and agag said surelythe bitterness of death is past and samuel said as the sword hath made women childless soshall thy mother be childless among women and samuel hewed agag inpieces before the lord in gilgal then samuel went to ramah and saul went up to his house togibeah of saul and samuel came no more to see saul until the day of his deathnevertheless samuel mourned for saul and the lord repented that hehad made saul king over israel and the lord said unto samuel how long wilt thou mourn for saulseeing i have rejected him from reigning over israel fill thine hornwith oil and go i will send thee to jesse the bethlehemite for ihave provided me a king among his sons and samuel said how can i go if saul hear it he will kill meand the lord said take an heifer with thee and say i am come tosacrifice to the lord and call jesse to the sacrifice and i will shew thee what thoushalt do and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom i name unto thee and samuel did that which the lord spake and came to bethlehemand the elders of the town trembled at his coming and said comestthou peaceably   and he said peaceably i am come to sacrificeunto the lord sanctify yourselves and come with me to the sacrificeand he sanctified jesse and his sons and called them to thesacrifice and it came to pass when they were come that he looked oneliab and said surely the lords anointed is before him but the lord said unto samuel look not on his countenance or onthe height of his stature because i have refused him for the lordseeth not as man seeth for man looketh on the outward appearance butthe lord looketh on the heart then jesse called abinadab and made him pass before samuel andhe said neither hath the lord chosen this then jesse made shammah to pass by and he said neither hath thelord chosen this again jesse made seven of his sons to pass before samuel andsamuel said unto jesse the lord hath not chosen these and samuel said unto jesse are here all thy children and hesaid there remaineth yet the youngest and behold he keepeth thesheep and samuel said unto jesse send and fetch him for we will notsit down till he come hither and he sent and brought him in now he was ruddy and withal ofa beautiful countenance and goodly to look to and the lord saidarise anoint him for this is he then samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midstof his brethren and the spirit of the lord came upon david from thatday forward so samuel rose up and went to ramah but the spirit of the lord departed from saul and an evilspirit from the lord troubled him and sauls servants said unto him behold now an evil spiritfrom god troubleth thee let our lord now command thy servants which are before thee toseek out a man who is a cunning player on an harp and it shall cometo pass when the evil spirit from god is upon thee that he shallplay with his hand and thou shalt be well and saul said unto his servants provide me now a man that canplay well and bring him to me then answered one of the servants and said behold i have seena son of jesse the bethlehemite that is cunning in playing and amighty valiant man and a man of war and prudent in matters and acomely person and the lord is with him wherefore saul sent messengers unto jesse and said send medavid thy son which is with the sheep and jesse took an ass laden with bread and a bottle of wineand a kid and sent them by david his son unto saul and david came to saul and stood before him and he loved himgreatly and he became his armourbearer and saul sent to jesse saying let david i pray thee standbefore me for he hath found favour in my sight and it came to pass when the evil spirit from god was uponsaul that david took an harp and played with his hand so saul wasrefreshed and was well and the evil spirit departed from him now the philistines gathered together their armies to battle andwere gathered together at shochoh which belongeth to judah andpitched between shochoh and azekah in ephesdammim and saul and the men of israel were gathered together andpitched by the valley of elah and set the battle in array against thephilistines and the philistines stood on a mountain on the one side andisrael stood on a mountain on the other side and there was a valleybetween them and there went out a champion out of the camp of the philistinesnamed goliath of gath whose height was six cubits and a span and he had an helmet of brass upon his head and he was armedwith a coat of mail and the weight of the coat was five thousandshekels of brass and he had greaves of brass upon his legs and a target of brassbetween his shoulders and the staff of his spear was like a weavers beam and hisspears head weighed six hundred shekels of iron and one bearing ashield went before him and he stood and cried unto the armies of israel and said untothem why are ye come out to set your battle in array am not i aphilistine and ye servants to saul choose you a man for you and lethim come down to me if he be able to fight with me and to kill me then will we beyour servants but if i prevail against him and kill him then shallye be our servants and serve us and the philistine said i defy the armies of israel this daygive me a man that we may fight together when saul and all israel heard those words of the philistinethey were dismayed and greatly afraid now david was the son of that ephrathite of bethlehemjudahwhose name was jesse and he had eight sons and the man went amongmen for an old man in the days of saul and the three eldest sons of jesse went and followed saul to thebattle and the names of his three sons that went to the battle wereeliab the firstborn and next unto him abinadab and the thirdshammah and david was the youngest and the three eldest followed saul but david went and returned from saul to feed his fathers sheepat bethlehem and the philistine drew near morning and evening and presentedhimself forty days and jesse said unto david his son take now for thy brethren anephah of this parched corn and these ten loaves and run to the campof thy brethren  and carry these ten cheeses unto the captain oftheir thousand and look how thy brethren fare and take their pledge now saul and they and all the men of israel were in thevalley of elah fighting with the philistines and david rose up early in the morning and left the sheep witha keeper and took and went as jesse had commanded him and he cameto the trench as the host was going forth to the fight and shoutedfor the battle for israel and the philistines had put the battle in array armyagainst army and david left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of thecarriage and ran into the army and came and saluted his brethren and as he talked with them behold there came up the championthe philistine of gath goliath by name out of the armies of thephilistines and spake according to the same words and david heardthem and all the men of israel when they saw the man fled from himand were sore afraid and the men of israel said have ye seen this man that is comeup  surely to defy israel is he come up and it shall be that theman who killeth him the king will enrich him with great riches andwill give him his daughter and make his fathers house free inisrael and david spake to the men that stood by him saying what shallbe done to the man that killeth this philistine and taketh away thereproach from israel for who is this uncircumcised philistine thathe should defy the armies of the living god   and the peopleanswered him after this manner saying so shall it be done to the manthat killeth him and eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the menand eliabs anger was kindled against david and he said why camestthou down hither and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in thewilderness i know thy pride and the naughtiness of thine heart forthou art come down that thou mightest see the battle and david said what have i now done is there not a cause and he turned from him toward another and spake after the samemanner and the people answered him again after the former manner and when the words were heard which david spake they rehearsedthem before saul and he sent for him and david said to saul let no mans heart fail because of himthy servant will go and fight with this philistine and saul said to david thou art not able to go against thisphilistine to fight with him for thou art but a youth and he a manof war from his youth and david said unto saul thy servant kept his fathers sheepand there came a lion and a bear and took a lamb out of the flock and i went out after him and smote him and delivered it out ofhis mouth and when he arose against me i caught him by his beardand smote him and slew him thy servant slew both the lion and the bear and thisuncircumcised philistine shall be as one of them seeing he hathdefied the armies of the living god david said moreover the lord that delivered me out of the pawof the lion and out of the paw of the bear he will deliver me out ofthe hand of this philistine and saul said unto david go and thelord be with thee and saul armed david with his armour and he put an helmet ofbrass upon his head also he armed him with a coat of mail and david girded his sword upon his armour and he assayed togo for he had not proved it and david said unto saul i cannot gowith these for i have not proved them and david put them off him and he took his staff in his hand and chose him five smoothstones out of the brook and put them in a shepherds bag which hehad even in a scrip and his sling was in his hand and he drew nearto the philistine and the philistine came on and drew near unto david and the manthat bare the shield went before him and when the philistine looked about and saw david hedisdained him for he was but a youth and ruddy and of a faircountenance and the philistine said unto david am i a dog that thou comestto me with staves and the philistine cursed david by his gods and the philistine said to david come to me and i will givethy flesh unto the fowls of the air and to the beasts of the field then said david to the philistine thou comest to me with asword and with a spear and with a shield but i come to thee in thename of the lord of hosts the god of the armies of israel whom thouhast defied this day will the lord deliver thee into mine hand and i willsmite thee and take thine head from thee and i will give thecarcases of the host of the philistines this day unto the fowls of theair and to the wild beasts of the earth that all the earth may knowthat there is a god in israel and all this assembly shall know that the lord saveth not withsword and spear for the battle is the lords and he will give youinto our hands and it came to pass when the philistine arose and came anddrew nigh to meet david that david hastened and ran toward the armyto meet the philistine and david put his hand in his bag and took thence a stone andslang it and smote the philistine in his forehead that the stonesunk into his forehead and he fell upon his face to the earth so david prevailed over the philistine with a sling and with astone and smote the philistine and slew him but there was no swordin the hand of david therefore david ran and stood upon the philistine and took hissword and drew it out of the sheath thereof and slew him and cutoff his head therewith and when the philistines saw their championwas dead they fled and the men of israel and of judah arose and shouted andpursued the philistines until thou come to the valley and to thegates of ekronand the wounded of the philistines fell down by the way to shaaraimeven unto gath and unto ekron and the children of israel returned from chasing after thephilistines and they spoiled their tents and david took the head of the philistine and brought it tojerusalem but he put his armour in his tent and when saul saw david go forth against the philistine he saidunto abner the captain of the host abner whose son is this youthand abner said as thy soul liveth o king i cannot tell and the king said enquire thou whose son the stripling is and as david returned from the slaughter of the philistineabner took him and brought him before saul with the head of thephilistine in his hand and saul said to him whose son art thou thou young man anddavid answered i am the son of thy servant jesse the bethlehemite and it came to pass when he had made an end of speaking untosaul that the soul of jonathan was knit with the soul of david andjonathan loved him as his own soul and saul took him that day and would let him go no more home tohis fathers house then jonathan and david made a covenant because he loved him ashis own soul and jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him andgave it to david and his garments even to his sword and to his bowand to his girdle and david went out whithersoever saul sent him and behavedhimself wisely and saul set him over the men of war and he wasaccepted in the sight of all the people and also in the sight ofsauls servants and it came to pass as they came when david was returned fromthe slaughter of the philistine that the women came out of all citiesof israel singing and dancing to meet king saul with tabrets withjoy and with instruments of musick and the women answered one another as they played and said saulhath slain his thousands and david his ten thousands and saul was very wroth and the saying displeased him and hesaid they have ascribed unto david ten thousands and to me they haveascribed but thousands and what can he have more but the kingdom and saul eyed david from that day and forward and it came to pass on the morrow that the evil spirit from godcame upon saul and he prophesied in the midst of the house and davidplayed with his hand as at other times and there was a javelin insauls hand and saul cast the javelin for he said i will smite david evento the wall with it and david avoided out of his presence twice and saul was afraid of david because the lord was with him andwas departed from saul therefore saul removed him from him and made him his captainover a thousand and he went out and came in before the people and david behaved himself wisely in all his ways and the lordwas with him wherefore when saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely hewas afraid of him but all israel and judah loved david because he went out andcame in before them and saul said to david behold my elder daughter merab her willi give thee to wife only be thou valiant for me and fight the lordsbattlesfor saul said let not mine hand be upon him but let the hand of thephilistines be upon him and david said unto saul who am i and what is my life or myfathers family in israel that i should be son in law to the king but it came to pass at the time when merab sauls daughtershould have been given to david that she was given unto adriel themeholathite to wife and michal sauls daughter loved david and they told saul andthe thing pleased him and saul said i will give him her that she may be a snare tohim and that the hand of the philistines may be against himwherefore saul said to david thou shalt this day be my son in law inthe one of the twain and saul commanded his servants saying commune with davidsecretly and say behold the king hath delight in thee and all hisservants love thee now therefore be the kings son in law and sauls servants spake those words in the ears of david anddavid said seemeth it to you a light thing to be a kings son in lawseeing that i am a poor man and lightly esteemed   and theservants of saul told him saying on this manner spake david and saul said thus shall ye say to david the king desireth notany dowry but an hundred foreskins of the philistines to be avengedof the kings enemies but saul thought to make david fall by the handof the philistines and when his servants told david these words it pleased davidwell to be the kings son in law and the days were not expired wherefore david arose and went he and his men and slew of thephilistines two hundred men and david brought their foreskins andthey gave them in full tale to the king that he might be the kingsson in law and saul gave him michal his daughter to wife and saul saw and knew that the lord was with david and thatmichal sauls daughter loved him and saul was yet the more afraid of david and saul becamedavids enemy continually then the princes of the philistines went forth and it came topass after they went forth that david behaved himself more wiselythan all the servants of saul so that his name was much set by and saul spake to jonathan his son and to all his servants thatthey should kill david but jonathan sauls son delighted much in david and jonathantold david saying saul my father seeketh to kill thee nowtherefore i pray thee take heed to thyself until the morning andabide in a secret place and hide thyself  and i will go out andstand beside my father in the field where thou art and i will communewith my father of thee and what i see that i will tell thee and jonathan spake good of david unto saul his father and saidunto him let not the king sin against his servant against davidbecause he hath not sinned against thee and because his works havebeen to theeward very good  for he did put his life in his handand slew the philistine and the lord wrought a great salvation forall israel thou sawest it and didst rejoice wherefore then wiltthou sin against innocent blood to slay david without a cause  and saul hearkened unto the voice of jonathan and saul sware as thelord liveth he shall not be slain and jonathan called david and jonathan shewed him all thosethingsand jonathan brought david to saul and he was in his presence as intimes past and there was war again and david went out and fought with thephilistines and slew them with a great slaughter and they fled fromhim and the evil spirit from the lord was upon saul as he sat in hishouse with his javelin in his hand and david played with his hand and saul sought to smite david even to the wall with thejavelin but he slipped away out of sauls presence and he smote thejavelin into the wall and david fled and escaped that night saul also sent messengers unto davids house to watch him andto slay him in the morning and michal davids wife told him sayingif thou save not thy life to night to morrow thou shalt be slain so michal let david down through a window and he went andfled and escaped and michal took an image and laid it in the bed and put apillow of goats hair for his bolster and covered it with a cloth and when saul sent messengers to take david she said he issick and saul sent the messengers again to see david saying bringhim up to me in the bed that i may slay him and when the messengers were come in behold there was an imagein the bed with a pillow of goats hair for his bolster and saul said unto michal why hast thou deceived me so andsent away mine enemy that he is escaped and michal answered saul hesaid unto me let me go why should i kill thee   so david fledand escaped and came to samuel to ramah and told him all that saulhad done to him and he and samuel went and dwelt in naioth and it was told saul saying behold david is at naioth inramah and saul sent messengers to take david and when they saw thecompany of the prophets prophesying and samuel standing as appointedover them the spirit of god was upon the messengers of saul and theyalso prophesied and when it was told saul he sent other messengers and theyprophesied likewise and saul sent messengers again the third timeand they prophesied also then went he also to ramah and came to a great well that is insechu and he asked and said where are samuel and david and onesaid behold they be at naioth in ramah and he went thither to naioth in ramah and the spirit of godwas upon him also and he went on and prophesied until he came tonaioth in ramah and he stripped off his clothes also and prophesied beforesamuel in like manner and lay down naked all that day and all thatnight wherefore they say is saul also among the prophets   anddavid fled from naioth in ramah and came and said before jonathanwhat have i done what is mine iniquity and what is my sin before thyfather that he seeketh my life   and he said unto him godforbid thou shalt not die behold my father will do nothing eithergreat or small but that he will shew it me and why should my fatherhide this thing from me it is not so and david sware moreover and said thy father certainly knoweththat i have found grace in thine eyes and he saith let not jonathanknow this lest he be grieved but truly as the lord liveth and asthy soul liveth there is but a step between me and death then said jonathan unto david whatsoever thy soul desireth iwill even do it for thee and david said unto jonathan behold to morrow is the new moonand i should not fail to sit with the king at meat but let me gothat i may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even if thy father at all miss me then say david earnestly askedleave of me that he might run to bethlehem his city for there is ayearly sacrifice there for all the family if he say thus it is well thy servant shall have peace but ifhe be very wroth then be sure that evil is determined by him therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant for thou hastbrought thy servant into a covenant of the lord with theenotwithstanding if there be in me iniquity slay me thyself for whyshouldest thou bring me to thy father   and jonathan said far beit from thee for if i knew certainly that evil were determined by myfather to come upon thee then would not i tell it thee   thensaid david to jonathan who shall tell me or what if thy fatheranswer thee roughly   and jonathan said unto david come andlet us go out into the field and they went out both of them into thefield and jonathan said unto david o lord god of israel when i havesounded my father about to morrow any time or the third day andbehold if there be good toward david and i then send not unto theeand shew it thee  the lord do so and much more to jonathan butif it please my father to do thee evil then i will shew it thee andsend thee away that thou mayest go in peace and the lord be withthee as he hath been with my father and thou shalt not only while yet i live shew me the kindness ofthe lord that i die not  but also thou shalt not cut off thykindness from my house for ever no not when the lord hath cut offthe enemies of david every one from the face of the earth so jonathan made a covenant with the house of david saying letthe lord even require it at the hand of davids enemies and jonathan caused david to swear again because he loved himfor he loved him as he loved his own soul then jonathan said to david to morrow is the new moon and thoushalt be missed because thy seat will be empty and when thou hast stayed three days then thou shalt go downquickly and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when thebusiness was in hand and shalt remain by the stone ezel and i will shoot three arrows on the side thereof as though ishot at a mark and behold i will send a lad saying go find out the arrowsif i expressly say unto the lad behold the arrows are on this sideof thee take them then come thou for there is peace to thee and nohurt as the lord liveth but if i say thus unto the young man behold the arrows arebeyond thee go thy way for the lord hath sent thee away and as touching the matter which thou and i have spoken ofbehold the lord be between thee and me for ever so david hid himself in the field and when the new moon wascome the king sat him down to eat meat and the king sat upon his seat as at other times even upon aseat by the wall and jonathan arose and abner sat by sauls sideand davids place was empty nevertheless saul spake not any thing that day for he thoughtsomething hath befallen him he is not clean surely he is not clean and it came to pass on the morrow which was the second day ofthe month that davids place was empty and saul said unto jonathanhis son wherefore cometh not the son of jesse to meat neitheryesterday nor to day   and jonathan answered saul davidearnestly asked leave of me to go to bethlehem  and he said letme go i pray thee for our family hath a sacrifice in the city andmy brother he hath commanded me to be there and now if i have foundfavour in thine eyes let me get away i pray thee and see mybrethren therefore he cometh not unto the kings table then sauls anger was kindled against jonathan and he said untohim thou son of the perverse rebellious woman do not i know thatthou hast chosen the son of jesse to thine own confusion and unto theconfusion of thy mothers nakedness   for as long as the son ofjesse liveth upon the ground thou shalt not be established nor thykingdom wherefore now send and fetch him unto me for he shall surelydie and jonathan answered saul his father and said unto himwherefore shall he be slain what hath he done   and saul cast ajavelin at him to smite him whereby jonathan knew that it wasdetermined of his father to slay david so jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger and did eat nomeat the second day of the month for he was grieved for davidbecause his father had done him shame and it came to pass in the morning that jonathan went out intothe field at the time appointed with david and a little lad with him and he said unto his lad run find out now the arrows which ishoot and as the lad ran he shot an arrow beyond him and when the lad was come to the place of the arrow whichjonathan had shot jonathan cried after the lad and said is not thearrow beyond thee   and jonathan cried after the lad makespeed haste stay not and jonathans lad gathered up the arrows andcame to his master but the lad knew not any thing only jonathan and david knew thematter and jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad and said unto himgo carry them to the city and as soon as the lad was gone david arose out of a placetoward the south and fell on his face to the ground and bowedhimself three times and they kissed one another and wept one withanother until david exceeded and jonathan said to david go in peace forasmuch as we havesworn both of us in the name of the lord saying the lord be betweenme and thee and between my seed and thy seed for ever and he aroseand departed and jonathan went into the city then came david to nob to ahimelech the priest and ahimelech wasafraid at the meeting of david and said unto him why art thou aloneand no man with thee   and david said unto ahimelech the priestthe king hath commanded me a business and hath said unto me let noman know any thing of the business whereabout i send thee and what ihave commanded thee and i have appointed my servants to such and sucha place now therefore what is under thine hand give me five loaves ofbread in mine hand or what there is present and the priest answered david and said there is no common breadunder mine hand but there is hallowed bread if the young men havekept themselves at least from women and david answered the priest and said unto him of a truthwomen have been kept from us about these three days since i came outand the vessels of the young men are holy and the bread is in amanner common yea though it were sanctified this day in the vessel so the priest gave him hallowed bread for there was no breadthere but the shewbread that was taken from before the lord to puthot bread in the day when it was taken away now a certain man of the servants of saul was there that daydetained before the lord and his name was doeg an edomite thechiefest of the herdmen that belonged to saul and david said unto ahimelech and is there not here under thinehand spear or sword for i have neither brought my sword nor myweapons with me because the kings business required haste and the priest said the sword of goliath the philistine whomthou slewest in the valley of elah behold it is here wrapped in acloth behind the ephod if thou wilt take that take it for there isno other save that here and david said there is none like that giveit me and david arose and fled that day for fear of saul and went toachish the king of gath and the servants of achish said unto him is not this david theking of the land did they not sing one to another of him in dancessaying saul hath slain his thousands and david his ten thousands and david laid up these words in his heart and was sore afraidof achish the king of gath and he changed his behaviour before them and feigned himselfmad in their hands and scrabbled on the doors of the gate and lethis spittle fall down upon his beard then said achish unto his servants lo ye see the man is madwherefore then have ye brought him to me   have i need of madmen that ye have brought this fellow to play the mad man in mypresence shall this fellow come into my house   david thereforedeparted thence and escaped to the cave adullam and when hisbrethren and all his fathers house heard it they went down thitherto him and every one that was in distress and every one that was indebt and every one that was discontented gathered themselves untohim and he became a captain over them and there were with him aboutfour hundred men and david went thence to mizpeh of moab and he said unto theking of moab let my father and my mother i pray thee come forthand be with you till i know what god will do for me and he brought them before the king of moab and they dwelt withhim all the while that david was in the hold and the prophet gad said unto david abide not in the holddepart and get thee into the land of judah then david departed andcame into the forest of hareth when saul heard that david was discovered and the men that werewith him now saul abode in gibeah under a tree in ramah having hisspear in his hand and all his servants were standing about him then saul said unto his servants that stood about him hear now yebenjamites will the son of jesse give every one of you fields andvineyards and make you all captains of thousands and captains ofhundreds  that all of you have conspired against me and there isnone that sheweth me that my son hath made a league with the son ofjesse and there is none of you that is sorry for me or sheweth untome that my son hath stirred up my servant against me to lie in waitas at this day   then answered doeg the edomite which was setover the servants of saul and said i saw the son of jesse coming tonob to ahimelech the son of ahitub and he enquired of the lord for him and gave him victuals andgave him the sword of goliath the philistine then the king sent to call ahimelech the priest the son ofahitub and all his fathers house the priests that were in nob andthey came all of them to the king and saul said hear now thou son of ahitub and he answeredhere i am my lord and saul said unto him why have ye conspired against me thouand the son of jesse in that thou hast given him bread and a swordand hast enquired of god for him that he should rise against me tolie in wait as at this day   then ahimelech answered the kingand said and who is so faithful among all thy servants as davidwhich is the kings son in law and goeth at thy bidding and ishonourable in thine house   did i then begin to enquire of godfor him be it far from me let not the king impute any thing unto hisservant nor to all the house of my father for thy servant knewnothing of all this less or more and the king said thou shalt surely die ahimelech thou andall thy fathers house and the king said unto the footmen that stood about him turnand slay the priests of the lord because their hand also is withdavid and because they knew when he fled and did not shew it to mebut the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fallupon the priests of the lord and the king said to doeg turn thou and fall upon the priestsand doeg the edomite turned and he fell upon the priests and slew onthat day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod and nob the city of the priests smote he with the edge of thesword both men and women children and sucklings and oxen andasses and sheep with the edge of the sword and one of the sons of ahimelech the son of ahitub namedabiathar escaped and fled after david and abiathar shewed david that saul had slain the lordspriests and david said unto abiathar i knew it that day when doeg theedomite was there that he would surely tell saul i have occasionedthe death of all the persons of thy fathers house abide thou with me fear not for he that seeketh my lifeseeketh thy life but with me thou shalt be in safeguard then they told david saying behold the philistines fightagainst keilah and they rob the threshingfloors therefore david enquired of the lord saying shall i go andsmite these philistines and the lord said unto david go and smitethe philistines and save keilah and davids men said unto him behold we be afraid here injudah how much more then if we come to keilah against the armies ofthe philistines   then david enquired of the lord yet again andthe lord answered him and said arise go down to keilah for i willdeliver the philistines into thine hand so david and his men went to keilah and fought with thephilistines and brought away their cattle and smote them with agreat slaughter so david saved the inhabitants of keilah and it came to pass when abiathar the son of ahimelech fled todavid to keilah that he came down with an ephod in his hand and it was told saul that david was come to keilah and saulsaid god hath delivered him into mine hand for he is shut in byentering into a town that hath gates and bars and saul called all the people together to war to go down tokeilah to besiege david and his men and david knew that saul secretly practised mischief against himand he said to abiathar the priest bring hither the ephod then said david o lord god of israel thy servant hathcertainly heard that saul seeketh to come to keilah to destroy thecity for my sake will the men of keilah deliver me up into his hand will saulcome down as thy servant hath heard o lord god of israel i beseechthee tell thy servant and the lord said he will come down then said david will the men of keilah deliver me and my meninto the hand of saul and the lord said they will deliver thee up then david and his men which were about six hundred arose anddeparted out of keilah and went whithersoever they could go and itwas told saul that david was escaped from keilah and he forbare to goforth and david abode in the wilderness in strong holds and remainedin a mountain in the wilderness of ziph and saul sought him everyday but god delivered him not into his hand and david saw that saul was come out to seek his life and davidwas in the wilderness of ziph in a wood and jonathan sauls son arose and went to david into the woodand strengthened his hand in god and he said unto him fear not for the hand of saul my fathershall not find thee and thou shalt be king over israel and i shallbe next unto thee and that also saul my father knoweth and they two made a covenant before the lord and david abode inthe wood and jonathan went to his house then came up the ziphites to saul to gibeah saying doth notdavid hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood in the hill ofhachilah which is on the south of jeshimon   now therefore oking come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come downand our part shall be to deliver him into the kings hand and saul said blessed be ye of the lord for ye have compassionon me go i pray you prepare yet and know and see his place wherehis haunt is and who hath seen him there for it is told me that hedealeth very subtilly see therefore and take knowledge of all the lurking placeswhere he hideth himself and come ye again to me with the certaintyand i will go with you and it shall come to pass if he be in theland that i will search him out throughout all the thousands ofjudah and they arose and went to ziph before saul but david and hismen were in the wilderness of maon in the plain on the south ofjeshimon saul also and his men went to seek him and they told davidwherefore he came down into a rock and abode in the wilderness ofmaon and when saul heard that he pursued after david in thewilderness of maon and saul went on this side of the mountain and david and hismen on that side of the mountain and david made haste to get away forfear of saul for saul and his men compassed david and his men roundabout to take them but there came a messenger unto saul saying haste thee andcome for the philistines have invaded the land wherefore saul returned from pursuing after david and wentagainst the philistines therefore they called that placeselahammahlekoth and david went up from thence and dwelt in strong holds atengedi and it came to pass when saul was returned from following thephilistines that it was told him saying behold david is in thewilderness of engedi then saul took three thousand chosen men out of all israel andwent to seek david and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats and he came to the sheepcotes by the way where was a cave andsaul went in to cover his feet and david and his men remained in thesides of the cave and the men of david said unto him behold the day of which thelord said unto thee behold i will deliver thine enemy into thinehand that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee thendavid arose and cut off the skirt of sauls robe privily and it came to pass afterward that davids heart smote himbecause he had cut off sauls skirt and he said unto his men the lord forbid that i should do thisthing unto my master the lords anointed to stretch forth mine handagainst him seeing he is the anointed of the lord so david stayed his servants with these words and suffered themnot to rise against saul but saul rose up out of the cave and wenton his way david also arose afterward and went out of the cave and criedafter saul saying my lord the king and when saul looked behind himdavid stooped with his face to the earth and bowed himself and david said to saul wherefore hearest thou mens wordssaying behold david seeketh thy hurt   behold this day thineeyes have seen how that the lord had delivered thee to day into minehand in the cave and some bade me kill thee but mine eye sparedthee and i said i will not put forth mine hand against my lord forhe is the lords anointed moreover my father see yea see the skirt of thy robe in myhand for in that i cut off the skirt of thy robe and killed theenot know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression inmine hand and i have not sinned against thee yet thou huntest mysoul to take it the lord judge between me and thee and the lord avenge me ofthee but mine hand shall not be upon thee as saith the proverb of the ancients wickedness proceedeth fromthe wicked but mine hand shall not be upon thee after whom is the king of israel come out after whom dost thoupursue after a dead dog after a flea the lord therefore be judge and judge between me and thee andsee and plead my cause and deliver me out of thine hand and it came to pass when david had made an end of speakingthese words unto saul that saul said is this thy voice my sondavid and saul lifted up his voice and wept and he said to david thou art more righteous than i for thouhast rewarded me good whereas i have rewarded thee evil and thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well withme forasmuch as when the lord had delivered me into thine hand thoukilledst me not for if a man find his enemy will he let him go well awaywherefore the lord reward thee good for that thou hast done unto methis day and now behold i know well that thou shalt surely be king andthat the kingdom of israel shall be established in thine hand swear now therefore unto me by the lord that thou wilt not cutoff my seed after me and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of myfathers house and david sware unto saul and saul went home but david and hismen gat them up unto the hold and samuel died and all the israelites were gathered togetherand lamented him and buried him in his house at ramah and davidarose and went down to the wilderness of paran and there was a man in maon whose possessions were in carmeland the man was very great and he had three thousand sheep and athousand goats and he was shearing his sheep in carmel now the name of the man was nabal and the name of his wifeabigail and she was a woman of good understanding and of a beautifulcountenance but the man was churlish and evil in his doings and hewas of the house of caleb and david heard in the wilderness that nabal did shear his sheep and david sent out ten young men and david said unto the youngmen get you up to carmel and go to nabal and greet him in my name and thus shall ye say to him that liveth in prosperity peace beboth to thee and peace be to thine house and peace be unto all thatthou hast and now i have heard that thou hast shearers now thy shepherdswhich were with us we hurt them not neither was there ought missingunto them all the while they were in carmel ask thy young men and they will shew thee wherefore let theyoung men find favour in thine eyes for we come in a good day givei pray thee whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto thy servants and tothy son david and when davids young men came they spake to nabal according toall those words in the name of david and ceased and nabal answered davids servants and said who is david andwho is the son of jesse there be many servants now a days that breakaway every man from his master shall i then take my bread and my water and my flesh that ihave killed for my shearers and give it unto men whom i know notwhence they be   so davids young men turned their way and wentagain and came and told him all those sayings and david said unto his men gird ye on every man his sword andthey girded on every man his sword and david also girded on hissword and there went up after david about four hundred men and twohundred abode by the stuff but one of the young men told abigail nabals wife sayingbehold david sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute ourmaster and he railed on them but the men were very good unto us and we were not hurtneither missed we any thing as long as we were conversant with themwhen we were in the fields  they were a wall unto us both bynight and day all the while we were with them keeping the sheep now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do for evil isdetermined against our master and against all his household for heis such a son of belial that a man cannot speak to him then abigail made haste and took two hundred loaves and twobottles of wine and five sheep ready dressed and five measures ofparched corn and an hundred clusters of raisins and two hundredcakes of figs and laid them on asses and she said unto her servants go on before me behold i comeafter you but she told not her husband nabal and it was so as she rode on the ass that she came down by thecovert on the hill and behold david and his men came down againsther and she met them now david had said surely in vain have i kept all that thisfellow hath in the wilderness so that nothing was missed of all thatpertained unto him and he hath requited me evil for good so and more also do god unto the enemies of david if i leave ofall that pertain to him by the morning light any that pisseth againstthe wall and when abigail saw david she hasted and lighted off the assand fell before david on her face and bowed herself to the ground and fell at his feet and said upon me my lord upon me letthis iniquity be and let thine handmaid i pray thee speak in thineaudience and hear the words of thine handmaid let not my lord i pray thee regard this man of belial evennabal for as his name is so is he nabal is his name and folly iswith him but i thine handmaid saw not the young men of my lord whomthou didst send now therefore my lord as the lord liveth and as thy soulliveth seeing the lord hath withholden thee from coming to shedblood and from avenging thyself with thine own hand now let thineenemies and they that seek evil to my lord be as nabal and now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto mylord let it even be given unto the young men that follow my lord i pray thee forgive the trespass of thine handmaid for thelord will certainly make my lord a sure house because my lordfighteth the battles of the lord and evil hath not been found in theeall thy days yet a man is risen to pursue thee and to seek thy soul but thesoul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the lord thygod and the souls of thine enemies them shall he sling out as outof the middle of a sling and it shall come to pass when the lord shall have done to mylord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning theeand shall have appointed thee ruler over israel  that this shallbe no grief unto thee nor offence of heart unto my lord either thatthou hast shed blood causeless or that my lord hath avenged himselfbut when the lord shall have dealt well with my lord then rememberthine handmaid and david said to abigail blessed be the lord god of israelwhich sent thee this day to meet me  and blessed be thy adviceand blessed be thou which hast kept me this day from coming to shedblood and from avenging myself with mine own hand for in very deed as the lord god of israel liveth which hathkept me back from hurting thee except thou hadst hasted and come tomeet me surely there had not been left unto nabal by the morninglight any that pisseth against the wall so david received of her hand that which she had brought himand said unto her go up in peace to thine house see i havehearkened to thy voice and have accepted thy person and abigail came to nabal and behold he held a feast in hishouse like the feast of a king and nabals heart was merry withinhim for he was very drunken wherefore she told him nothing less ormore until the morning light but it came to pass in the morning when the wine was gone outof nabal and his wife had told him these things that his heart diedwithin him and he became as a stone and it came to pass about ten days after that the lord smotenabal that he died and when david heard that nabal was dead he said blessed bethe lord that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand ofnabal and hath kept his servant from evil for the lord hath returnedthe wickedness of nabal upon his own head and david sent and communedwith abigail to take her to him to wife and when the servants of david were come to abigail to carmelthey spake unto her saying david sent us unto thee to take thee tohim to wife and she arose and bowed herself on her face to the earth andsaid behold let thine handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of theservants of my lord and abigail hasted and arose and rode upon an ass with fivedamsels of hers that went after her and she went after the messengersof david and became his wife david also took ahinoam of jezreel and they were also both ofthem his wives but saul had given michal his daughter davids wife to phaltithe son of laish which was of gallim and the ziphites came unto saul to gibeah saying doth not davidhide himself in the hill of hachilah which is before jeshimon  then saul arose and went down to the wilderness of ziph having threethousand chosen men of israel with him to seek david in thewilderness of ziph and saul pitched in the hill of hachilah which is beforejeshimon by the way but david abode in the wilderness and he sawthat saul came after him into the wilderness david therefore sent out spies and understood that saul was comein very deed and david arose and came to the place where saul had pitchedand david beheld the place where saul lay and abner the son of nerthe captain of his host and saul lay in the trench and the peoplepitched round about him then answered david and said to ahimelech the hittite and toabishai the son of zeruiah brother to joab saying who will go downwith me to saul to the camp and abishai said i will go down withthee so david and abishai came to the people by night and beholdsaul lay sleeping within the trench and his spear stuck in the groundat his bolster but abner and the people lay round about him then said abishai to david god hath delivered thine enemy intothine hand this day now therefore let me smite him i pray thee withthe spear even to the earth at once and i will not smite him thesecond time and david said to abishai destroy him not for who can stretchforth his hand against the lords anointed and be guiltless  david said furthermore as the lord liveth the lord shall smite himor his day shall come to die or he shall descend into battle andperish the lord forbid that i should stretch forth mine hand againstthe lords anointed but i pray thee take thou now the spear that isat his bolster and the cruse of water and let us go so david took the spear and the cruse of water from saulsbolster and they gat them away and no man saw it nor knew itneither awaked for they were all asleep because a deep sleep fromthe lord was fallen upon them then david went over to the other side and stood on the top ofan hill afar off a great space being between them  and davidcried to the people and to abner the son of ner saying answerestthou not abner then abner answered and said who art thou thatcriest to the king   and david said to abner art not thou avaliant man and who is like to thee in israel wherefore then hastthou not kept thy lord the king for there came one of the people into destroy the king thy lord this thing is not good that thou hast done as the lord livethye are worthy to die because ye have not kept your master the lordsanointedand now see where the kings spear is and the cruse of water that wasat his bolster and saul knew davids voice and said is this thy voice my sondavid and david said it is my voice my lord o king and he said wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after hisservant  for what have i done or what evil is in mine hand  now therefore i pray thee let my lord the king hear the words of hisservant if the lord have stirred thee up against me let him acceptan offering but if they be the children of men cursed be they beforethe lord for they have driven me out this day from abiding in theinheritance of the lord saying go serve other gods now therefore let not my blood fall to the earth before theface of the lord for the king of israel is come out to seek a fleaas when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains then said saul i have sinned return my son david for i willno more do thee harm because my soul was precious in thine eyes thisday behold i have played the fool and have erred exceedingly and david answered and said behold the kings spear and letone of the young men come over and fetch it the lord render to every man his righteousness and hisfaithfulness for the lord delivered thee into my hand to day but iwould not stretch forth mine hand against the lords anointed and behold as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyesso let my life be much set by in the eyes of the lord and let himdeliver me out of all tribulation then saul said to david blessed be thou my son david thoushalt both do great things and also shalt still prevail so davidwent on his way and saul returned to his place and david said in his heart i shall now perish one day by thehand of saul there is nothing better for me than that i shouldspeedily escape into the land of the philistines and saul shalldespair of me to seek me any more in any coast of israel so shall iescape out of his hand and david arose and he passed over with the six hundred men thatwere with him unto achish the son of maoch king of gath and david dwelt with achish at gath he and his men every manwith his household even david with his two wives ahinoam thejezreelitess and abigail the carmelitess nabals wife and it was told saul that david was fled to gath and he soughtno more again for him and david said unto achish if i have now found grace in thineeyes let them give me a place in some town in the country that i maydwell there for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city withthee   then achish gave him ziklag that day wherefore ziklagpertaineth unto the kings of judah unto this day and the time that david dwelt in the country of the philistineswas a full year and four months and david and his men went up and invaded the geshurites andthe gezrites and the amalekites for those nations were of old theinhabitants of the land as thou goest to shur even unto the land ofegypt and david smote the land and left neither man nor woman aliveand took away the sheep and the oxen and the asses and the camelsand the apparel and returned and came to achish and achish said whither have ye made a road to day and davidsaid against the south of judah and against the south of thejerahmeelites and against the south of the kenites and david saved neither man nor woman alive to bring tidings togath saying lest they should tell on us saying so did david andso will be his manner all the while he dwelleth in the country of thephilistines and achish believed david saying he hath made his peopleisrael utterly to abhor him therefore he shall be my servant forever and it came to pass in those days that the philistines gatheredtheir armies together for warfare to fight with israel and achishsaid unto david know thou assuredly that thou shalt go out with meto battle thou and thy men and david said to achish surely thou shalt know what thy servantcan do and achish said to david therefore will i make thee keeper ofmine head for ever now samuel was dead and all israel had lamented him and buriedhim in ramah even in his own city and saul had put away those thathad familiar spirits and the wizards out of the land and the philistines gathered themselves together and came andpitched in shunem and saul gathered all israel together and theypitched in gilboa and when saul saw the host of the philistines he was afraid andhis heart greatly trembled and when saul enquired of the lord the lord answered him notneither by dreams nor by urim nor by prophets then said saul unto his servants seek me a woman that hath afamiliar spirit that i may go to her and enquire of her and hisservants said to him behold there is a woman that hath a familiarspirit at endor and saul disguised himself and put on other raiment and hewent and two men with him and they came to the woman by night andhe said i pray thee divine unto me by the familiar spirit and bringme him up whom i shall name unto thee and the woman said unto him behold thou knowest what saul hathdone how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits and thewizards out of the land wherefore then layest thou a snare for mylife to cause me to die   and saul sware to her by the lordsaying as the lord liveth there shall no punishment happen to theefor this thing then said the woman whom shall i bring up unto thee and hesaid bring me up samuel and when the woman saw samuel she cried with a loud voice andthe woman spake to saul saying why hast thou deceived me for thouart saul and the king said unto her be not afraid for what sawest thouand the woman said unto saul i saw gods ascending out of the earth and he said unto her what form is he of and she said an oldman cometh up and he is covered with a mantle and saul perceivedthat it was samuel and he stooped with his face to the ground andbowed himself and samuel said to saul why hast thou disquieted me to bringme up and saul answered i am sore distressed for the philistinesmake war against me and god is departed from me and answereth me nomore neither by prophets nor by dreams therefore i have calledthee that thou mayest make known unto me what i shall do then said samuel wherefore then dost thou ask of me seeing thelord is departed from thee and is become thine enemy   and thelord hath done to him as he spake by me for the lord hath rent thekingdom out of thine hand and given it to thy neighbour even todavid  because thou obeyedst not the voice of the lord norexecutedst his fierce wrath upon amalek therefore hath the lord donethis thing unto thee this day moreover the lord will also deliver israel with thee into thehand of the philistines and to morrow shalt thou and thy sons be withme the lord also shall deliver the host of israel into the hand ofthe philistines then saul fell straightway all along on the earth and was soreafraid because of the words of samuel and there was no strength inhim for he had eaten no bread all the day nor all the night and the woman came unto saul and saw that he was sore troubledand said unto him behold thine handmaid hath obeyed thy voice and ihave put my life in my hand and have hearkened unto thy words whichthou spakest unto me now therefore i pray thee hearken thou also unto the voice ofthine handmaid and let me set a morsel of bread before thee and eatthat thou mayest have strength when thou goest on thy way but he refused and said i will not eat but his servantstogether with the woman compelled him and he hearkened unto theirvoice so he arose from the earth and sat upon the bed and the woman had a fat calf in the house and she hasted andkilled it and took flour and kneaded it and did bake unleavenedbread thereof  and she brought it before saul and before hisservants and they did eat then they rose up and went away thatnight now the philistines gathered together all their armies to aphekand the israelites pitched by a fountain which is in jezreel and the lords of the philistines passed on by hundreds and bythousands but david and his men passed on in the rereward withachish then said the princes of the philistines what do these hebrewshere  and achish said unto the princes of the philistines is notthis david the servant of saul the king of israel which hath beenwith me these days or these years and i have found no fault in himsince he fell unto me unto this day   and the princes of thephilistines were wroth with him and the princes of the philistinessaid unto him make this fellow return that he may go again to hisplace which thou hast appointed him and let him not go down with usto battle lest in the battle he be an adversary to us for wherewithshould he reconcile himself unto his master should it not be with theheads of these men   is not this david of whom they sang one toanother in dances saying saul slew his thousands and david his tenthousands   then achish called david and said unto him surelyas the lord liveth thou hast been upright and thy going out and thycoming in with me in the host is good in my sight for i have notfound evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this daynevertheless the lords favour thee not wherefore now return and go in peace that thou displease notthe lords of the philistines and david said unto achish but what have i done and what hastthou found in thy servant so long as i have been with thee unto thisday that i may not go fight against the enemies of my lord the king and achish answered and said to david i know that thou art goodin my sight as an angel of god notwithstanding the princes of thephilistines have said he shall not go up with us to the battle wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy mastersservants that are come with thee and as soon as ye be up early in themorning and have light depart so david and his men rose up early to depart in the morning toreturn into the land of the philistines and the philistines went upto jezreel and it came to pass when david and his men were come to ziklagon the third day that the amalekites had invaded the south andziklag and smitten ziklag and burned it with fire  and hadtaken the women captives that were therein they slew not any eithergreat or small but carried them away and went on their way so david and his men came to the city and behold it was burnedwith fire and their wives and their sons and their daughters weretaken captives then david and the people that were with him lifted up theirvoice and wept until they had no more power to weep and davids two wives were taken captives ahinoam thejezreelitess and abigail the wife of nabal the carmelite and david was greatly distressed for the people spake of stoninghim because the soul of all the people was grieved every man for hissons and for his daughters but david encouraged himself in the lordhis god and david said to abiathar the priest ahimelechs son i praythee bring me hither the ephod and abiathar brought thither theephod to david and david enquired at the lord saying shall i pursue after thistroop shall i overtake them and he answered him pursue for thoushalt surely overtake them and without fail recover all so david went he and the six hundred men that were with him andcame to the brook besor where those that were left behind stayed but david pursued he and four hundred men for two hundredabode behind which were so faint that they could not go over thebrook besor and they found an egyptian in the field and brought him todavid and gave him bread and he did eat and they made him drinkwater  and they gave him a piece of a cake of figs and twoclusters of raisins and when he had eaten his spirit came again tohim for he had eaten no bread nor drunk any water three days andthree nights and david said unto him to whom belongest thou and whence artthou and he said i am a young man of egypt servant to an amalekiteand my master left me because three days agone i fell sick we made an invasion upon the south of the cherethites and uponthe coast which belongeth to judah and upon the south of caleb andwe burned ziklag with fire and david said to him canst thou bring me down to this companyand he said swear unto me by god that thou wilt neither kill me nordeliver me into the hands of my master and i will bring thee down tothis company and when he had brought him down behold they were spreadabroad upon all the earth eating and drinking and dancing becauseof all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of thephilistines and out of the land of judah and david smote them from the twilight even unto the evening ofthe next day and there escaped not a man of them save four hundredyoung men which rode upon camels and fled and david recovered all that the amalekites had carried awayand david rescued his two wives and there was nothing lacking to them neither small nor greatneither sons nor daughters neither spoil nor any thing that they hadtaken to them david recovered all and david took all the flocks and the herds which they dravebefore those other cattle and said this is davids spoil and david came to the two hundred men which were so faint thatthey could not follow david whom they had made also to abide at thebrook besor and they went forth to meet david and to meet the peoplethat were with him and when david came near to the people he salutedthem then answered all the wicked men and men of belial of thosethat went with david and said because they went not with us we willnot give them ought of the spoil that we have recovered save to everyman his wife and his children that they may lead them away anddepart then said david ye shall not do so my brethren with thatwhich the lord hath given us who hath preserved us and delivered thecompany that came against us into our hand for who will hearken unto you in this matter but as his part isthat goeth down to the battle so shall his part be that tarrieth bythe stuff they shall part alike and it was so from that day forward that he made it a statuteand an ordinance for israel unto this day and when david came to ziklag he sent of the spoil unto theelders of judah even to his friends saying behold a present for youof the spoil of the enemies of the lord  to them which were inbethel and to them which were in south ramoth and to them which werein jattir  and to them which were in aroer and to them whichwere in siphmoth and to them which were in eshtemoa  and tothem which were in rachal and to them which were in the cities of thejerahmeelites and to them which were in the cities of the kenites and to them which were in hormah and to them which were inchorashan and to them which were in athach  and to them whichwere in hebron and to all the places where david himself and his menwere wont to haunt now the philistines fought against israel and the men of israelfled from before the philistines and fell down slain in mount gilboa and the philistines followed hard upon saul and upon his sonsand the philistines slew jonathan and abinadab and melchishuasauls sons and the battle went sore against saul and the archers hit himand he was sore wounded of the archers then said saul unto his armourbearer draw thy sword and thrustme through therewith lest these uncircumcised come and thrust methrough and abuse me but his armourbearer would not for he was soreafraid therefore saul took a sword and fell upon it and when his armourbearer saw that saul was dead he felllikewise upon his sword and died with him so saul died and his three sons and his armourbearer and allhis men that same day together and when the men of israel that were on the other side of thevalley and they that were on the other side jordan saw that the menof israel fled and that saul and his sons were dead they forsook thecities and fled and the philistines came and dwelt in them and it came to pass on the morrow when the philistines came tostrip the slain that they found saul and his three sons fallen inmount gilboa and they cut off his head and stripped off his armour and sentinto the land of the philistines round about to publish it in thehouse of their idols and among the people and they put his armour in the house of ashtaroth and theyfastened his body to the wall of bethshan and when the inhabitants of jabeshgilead heard of that which thephilistines had done to saul  all the valiant men arose andwent all night and took the body of saul and the bodies of his sonsfrom the wall of bethshan and came to jabesh and burnt them there and they took their bones and buried them under a tree atjabesh and fasted seven daysthe second book of samuelotherwise calledthe second book of the kings now it came to pass after the death of saul when david wasreturned from the slaughter of the amalekites and david had abode twodays in ziklag  it came even to pass on the third day thatbehold a man came out of the camp from saul with his clothes rentand earth upon his head and so it was when he came to david that hefell to the earth and did obeisance and david said unto him from whence comest thou and he said untohim out of the camp of israel am i escaped and david said unto him how went the matter i pray thee tellmeand he answered that the people are fled from the battle and many ofthe people also are fallen and dead and saul and jonathan his son aredead also and david said unto the young man that told him how knowest thouthat saul and jonathan his son be dead   and the young man thattold him said as i happened by chance upon mount gilboa behold saulleaned upon his spear and lo the chariots and horsemen followedhard after him and when he looked behind him he saw me and called unto me andi answered here am i and he said unto me who art thou and i answered him i am anamalekite he said unto me again stand i pray thee upon me and slay mefor anguish is come upon me because my life is yet whole in me so i stood upon him and slew him because i was sure that hecould not live after that he was fallen and i took the crown that wasupon his head and the bracelet that was on his arm and have broughtthem hither unto my lord then david took hold on his clothes and rent them and likewiseall the men that were with him  and they mourned and wept andfasted until even for saul and for jonathan his son and for thepeople of the lord and for the house of israel because they werefallen by the sword and david said unto the young man that told him whence art thouand he answered i am the son of a stranger an amalekite and david said unto him how wast thou not afraid to stretchforth thine hand to destroy the lords anointed   and davidcalled one of the young men and said go near and fall upon him andhe smote him that he died and david said unto him thy blood be upon thy head for thymouth hath testified against thee saying i have slain the lordsanointed and david lamented with this lamentation over saul and overjonathan his son  also he bade them teach the children of judahthe use of the bow behold it is written in the book of jasher the beauty of israel is slain upon thy high places how are themighty fallen   tell it not in gath publish it not in thestreets of askelon lest the daughters of the philistines rejoicelest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph ye mountains of gilboa let there be no dew neither let there berain upon you nor fields of offerings for there the shield of themighty is vilely cast away the shield of saul as though he had notbeen anointed with oil from the blood of the slain from the fat of the mighty the bowof jonathan turned not back and the sword of saul returned not empty saul and jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives and intheir death they were not divided they were swifter than eagles theywere stronger than lions ye daughters of israel weep over saul who clothed you inscarlet with other delights who put on ornaments of gold upon yourapparel how are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle o jonathanthou wast slain in thine high places i am distressed for thee my brother jonathan very pleasant hastthou been unto me thy love to me was wonderful passing the love ofwomen how are the mighty fallen and the weapons of war perished  and it came to pass after this that david enquired of the lordsaying shall i go up into any of the cities of judah and the lordsaid unto him go up and david said whither shall i go up and hesaid unto hebron so david went up thither and his two wives also ahinoam thejezreelitess and abigail nabals wife the carmelite and his men that were with him did david bring up every man withhis household and they dwelt in the cities of hebron and the men of judah came and there they anointed david king overthe house of judah and they told david saying that the men ofjabeshgilead were they that buried saul and david sent messengers unto the men of jabeshgilead and saidunto them blessed be ye of the lord that ye have shewed thiskindness unto your lord even unto saul and have buried him and now the lord shew kindness and truth unto you and i also willrequite you this kindness because ye have done this thing therefore now let your hands be strengthened and be ye valiantfor your master saul is dead and also the house of judah haveanointed me king over them but abner the son of ner captain of sauls host took ishbosheththe son of saul and brought him over to mahanaim  and made himking over gilead and over the ashurites and over jezreel and overephraim and over benjamin and over all israel ishbosheth sauls son was forty years old when he began to reignover israel and reigned two years but the house of judah followeddavid and the time that david was king in hebron over the house ofjudah was seven years and six months and abner the son of ner and the servants of ishbosheth the sonof saul went out from mahanaim to gibeon and joab the son of zeruiah and the servants of david went outand met together by the pool of gibeon and they sat down the one onthe one side of the pool and the other on the other side of the pool and abner said to joab let the young men now arise and playbefore us and joab said let them arise then there arose and went over by number twelve of benjaminwhich pertained to ishbosheth the son of saul and twelve of theservants of david and they caught every one his fellow by the head and thrust hissword in his fellows side so they fell down together wherefore thatplace was called helkathhazzurim which is in gibeon and there was a very sore battle that day and abner was beatenand the men of israel before the servants of david and there were three sons of zeruiah there joab and abishaiand asahel and asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe and asahel pursued after abner and in going he turned not to theright hand nor to the left from following abner then abner looked behind him and said art thou asahel and heanswered i am and abner said to him turn thee aside to thy right hand or tothy left and lay thee hold on one of the young men and take thee hisarmourbut asahel would not turn aside from following of him and abner said again to asahel turn thee aside from followingme wherefore should i smite thee to the ground how then should ihold up my face to joab thy brother   howbeit he refused to turnaside wherefore abner with the hinder end of the spear smote himunder the fifth rib that the spear came out behind him and he felldown there and died in the same place and it came to pass that asmany as came to the place where asahel fell down and died stood still joab also and abishai pursued after abner and the sun went downwhen they were come to the hill of ammah that lieth before giah bythe way of the wilderness of gibeon and the children of benjamin gathered themselves together afterabner and became one troop and stood on the top of an hill then abner called to joab and said shall the sword devour forever  knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter endhow long shall it be then ere thou bid the people return fromfollowing their brethren   and joab said as god liveth unlessthou hadst spoken surely then in the morning the people had gone upevery one from following his brother so joab blew a trumpet and all the people stood still andpursued after israel no more neither fought they any more and abner and his men walked all that night through the plainand passed over jordan and went through all bithron and they came tomahanaim and joab returned from following abner and when he had gatheredall the people together there lacked of davids servants nineteen menand asahel but the servants of david had smitten of benjamin and of abnersmen so that three hundred and threescore men died and they took up asahel and buried him in the sepulchre of hisfather which was in bethlehem and joab and his men went all nightand they came to hebron at break of day now there was long war between the house of saul and the house ofdavid but david waxed stronger and stronger and the house of saulwaxed weaker and weaker and unto david were sons born in hebron and his firstborn wasamnon of ahinoam the jezreelitess  and his second chileab ofabigail the wife of nabal the carmelite and the third absalom theson of maacah the daughter of talmai king of geshur  and thefourth adonijah the son of haggith and the fifth shephatiah the sonof abital  and the sixth ithream by eglah davids wife thesewere born to david in hebron and it came to pass while there was war between the house of sauland the house of david that abner made himself strong for the houseof saul and saul had a concubine whose name was rizpah the daughter ofaiah and ishbosheth said to abner wherefore hast thou gone in untomy fathers concubine   then was abner very wroth for the words ofishbosheth and said am i a dogs head which against judah do shewkindness this day unto the house of saul thy father to his brethrenand to his friends and have not delivered thee into the hand ofdavid that thou chargest me to day with a fault concerning thiswoman   so do god to abner and more also except as the lordhath sworn to david even so i do to him  to translate thekingdom from the house of saul and to set up the throne of david overisrael and over judah from dan even to beersheba and he could not answer abner a word again because he fearedhim and abner sent messengers to david on his behalf saying whoseis the land saying also make thy league with me and behold myhand shall be with thee to bring about all israel unto thee and he said well i will make a league with thee but one thingi require of thee that is thou shalt not see my face except thoufirst bring michal sauls daughter when thou comest to see my face and david sent messengers to ishbosheth sauls son sayingdeliver me my wife michal which i espoused to me for an hundredforeskins of the philistines and ishbosheth sent and took her from her husband even fromphaltiel the son of laish and her husband went with her along weeping behind her tobahurimthen said abner unto him go return and he returned and abner had communication with the elders of israel saying yesought for david in times past to be king over you  now then doit for the lord hath spoken of david saying by the hand of myservant david i will save my people israel out of the hand of thephilistines and out of the hand of all their enemies and abner also spake in the ears of benjamin and abner went alsoto speak in the ears of david in hebron all that seemed good toisrael and that seemed good to the whole house of benjamin so abner came to david to hebron and twenty men with him anddavid made abner and the men that were with him a feast and abner said unto david i will arise and go and will gatherall israel unto my lord the king that they may make a league withthee and that thou mayest reign over all that thine heart desirethand david sent abner away and he went in peace and behold the servants of david and joab came from pursuing atroop and brought in a great spoil with them but abner was not withdavid in hebron for he had sent him away and he was gone in peace when joab and all the host that was with him were come they toldjoab saying abner the son of ner came to the king and he hath senthim away and he is gone in peace then joab came to the king and said what hast thou donebehold abner came unto thee why is it that thou hast sent him awayand he is quite gone   thou knowest abner the son of ner that hecame to deceive thee and to know thy going out and thy coming in andto know all that thou doest and when joab was come out from david he sent messengers afterabner which brought him again from the well of sirah but david knewit not and when abner was returned to hebron joab took him aside in thegate to speak with him quietly and smote him there under the fifthrib that he died for the blood of asahel his brother and afterward when david heard it he said i and my kingdom areguiltless before the lord for ever from the blood of abner the son ofner  let it rest on the head of joab and on all his fathershouse and let there not fail from the house of joab one that hath anissue or that is a leper or that leaneth on a staff or that fallethon the sword or that lacketh bread so joab and abishai his brother slew abner because he had slaintheir brother asahel at gibeon in the battle and david said to joab and to all the people that were with himrend your clothes and gird you with sackcloth and mourn beforeabner and king david himself followed the bier and they buried abner in hebron and the king lifted up hisvoice and wept at the grave of abner and all the people wept and the king lamented over abner and said died abner as a fooldieth   thy hands were not bound nor thy feet put into fettersas a man falleth before wicked men so fellest thou and all thepeople wept again over him and when all the people came to cause david to eat meat while itwas yet day david sware saying so do god to me and more also if itaste bread or ought else till the sun be down and all the people took notice of it and it pleased them aswhatsoever the king did pleased all the people for all the people and all israel understood that day that it wasnot of the king to slay abner the son of ner and the king said unto his servants know ye not that there is aprince and a great man fallen this day in israel   and i am thisday weak though anointed king and these men the sons of zeruiah betoo hard for me the lord shall reward the doer of evil according tohis wickedness and when sauls son heard that abner was dead in hebron his handswere feeble and all the israelites were troubled and sauls son had two men that were captains of bands the nameof the one was baanah and the name of the other rechab the sons ofrimmon a beerothite of the children of benjamin for beeroth alsowas reckoned to benjamin and the beerothites fled to gittaim and were sojourners thereuntil this day   and jonathan sauls son had a son that waslame of his feet he was five years old when the tidings came of sauland jonathan out of jezreel and his nurse took him up and fled andit came to pass as she made haste to flee that he fell and becamelame and his name was mephibosheth and the sons of rimmon the beerothite rechab and baanah wentand came about the heat of the day to the house of ishbosheth who layon a bed at noon and they came thither into the midst of the house as though theywould have fetched wheat and they smote him under the fifth rib andrechab and baanah his brother escaped for when they came into the house he lay on his bed in hisbedchamber and they smote him and slew him and beheaded him andtook his head and gat them away through the plain all night and they brought the head of ishbosheth unto david to hebron andsaid to the king behold the head of ishbosheth the son of saul thineenemy which sought thy life and the lord hath avenged my lord theking this day of saul and of his seed and david answered rechab and baanah his brother the sons ofrimmon the beerothite and said unto them as the lord liveth whohath redeemed my soul out of all adversity  when one told mesaying behold saul is dead thinking to have brought good tidings itook hold of him and slew him in ziklag who thought that i wouldhave given him a reward for his tidings  how much more whenwicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon hisbed shall i not therefore now require his blood of your hand andtake you away from the earth   and david commanded his young menand they slew them and cut off their hands and their feet and hangedthem up over the pool in hebron but they took the head of ishboshethand buried it in the sepulchre of abner in hebron then came all the tribes of israel to david unto hebron andspake saying behold we are thy bone and thy flesh also in time past when saul was king over us thou wast he thatleddest out and broughtest in israel and the lord said to thee thoushalt feed my people israel and thou shalt be a captain over israel so all the elders of israel came to the king to hebron and kingdavid made a league with them in hebron before the lord and theyanointed david king over israel david was thirty years old when he began to reign and he reignedforty years in hebron he reigned over judah seven years and six months and injerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all israel and judah and the king and his men went to jerusalem unto the jebusites theinhabitants of the land which spake unto david saying except thoutake away the blind and the lame thou shalt not come in hitherthinking david cannot come in hither nevertheless david took the strong hold of zion the same is thecity of david and david said on that day whosoever getteth up to the gutterand smiteth the jebusites and the lame and the blind that are hatedof davids soul he shall be chief and captain wherefore they saidthe blind and the lame shall not come into the house so david dwelt in the fort and called it the city of david anddavid built round about from millo and inward and david went on and grew great and the lord god of hosts waswith him and hiram king of tyre sent messengers to david and cedar treesand carpenters and masons and they built david an house and david perceived that the lord had established him king overisrael and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people israelssake and david took him more concubines and wives out of jerusalemafter he was come from hebron and there were yet sons and daughtersborn to david and these be the names of those that were born unto him injerusalem shammuah and shobab and nathan and solomon  ibharalso and elishua and nepheg and japhia  and elishama andeliada and eliphalet but when the philistines heard that they had anointed david kingover israel all the philistines came up to seek david and davidheard of it and went down to the hold the philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley ofrephaim and david enquired of the lord saying shall i go up to thephilistines wilt thou deliver them into mine hand and the lord saidunto david go up for i will doubtless deliver the philistines intothine hand and david came to baalperazim and david smote them there andsaid the lord hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me as thebreach of waters therefore he called the name of that placebaalperazim and there they left their images and david and his men burnedthem and the philistines came up yet again and spread themselves inthe valley of rephaim and when david enquired of the lord he said thou shalt not goup but fetch a compass behind them and come upon them over againstthe mulberry trees and let it be when thou hearest the sound of a going in the topsof the mulberry trees that then thou shalt bestir thyself for thenshall the lord go out before thee to smite the host of thephilistines and david did so as the lord had commanded him and smote thephilistines from geba until thou come to gazer again david gathered together all the chosen men of israelthirty thousand and david arose and went with all the people that were with himfrom baale of judah to bring up from thence the ark of god whosename is called by the name of the lord of hosts that dwelleth betweenthe cherubims and they set the ark of god upon a new cart and brought it out ofthe house of abinadab that was in gibeah and uzzah and ahio the sonsof abinadab drave the new cart and they brought it out of the house of abinadab which was atgibeah accompanying the ark of god and ahio went before the ark and david and all the house of israel played before the lord onall manner of instruments made of fir wood even on harps and onpsalteries and on timbrels and on cornets and on cymbals and when they came to nachons threshingfloor uzzah put forth hishand to the ark of god and took hold of it for the oxen shook it and the anger of the lord was kindled against uzzah and god smotehim there for his error and there he died by the ark of god and david was displeased because the lord had made a breach uponuzzah and he called the name of the place perezuzzah to this day and david was afraid of the lord that day and said how shall theark of the lord come to me   so david would not remove the ark ofthe lord unto him into the city of david but david carried it asideinto the house of obededom the gittite and the ark of the lord continued in the house of obededom thegittite three months and the lord blessed obededom and all hishousehold and it was told king david saying the lord hath blessed thehouse of obededom and all that pertaineth unto him because of theark of god so david went and brought up the ark of god from the houseof obededom into the city of david with gladness and it was so that when they that bare the ark of the lord hadgone six paces he sacrificed oxen and fatlings and david danced before the lord with all his might and davidwas girded with a linen ephod so david and all the house of israel brought up the ark of thelord with shouting and with the sound of the trumpet and as the ark of the lord came into the city of david michalsauls daughter looked through a window and saw king david leapingand dancing before the lord and she despised him in her heart and they brought in the ark of the lord and set it in his placein the midst of the tabernacle that david had pitched for it anddavid offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the lord and as soon as david had made an end of offering burnt offeringsand peace offerings he blessed the people in the name of the lord ofhosts and he dealt among all the people even among the whole multitudeof israel as well to the women as men to every one a cake of breadand a good piece of flesh and a flagon of wine so all the peopledeparted every one to his house then david returned to bless his household and michal thedaughter of saul came out to meet david and said how glorious wasthe king of israel to day who uncovered himself to day in the eyes ofthe handmaids of his servants as one of the vain fellows shamelesslyuncovereth himself   and david said unto michal it was beforethe lord which chose me before thy father and before all his houseto appoint me ruler over the people of the lord over israeltherefore will i play before the lord and i will yet be more vile than thus and will be base in mineown sight and of the maidservants which thou hast spoken of of themshall i be had in honour therefore michal the daughter of saul had no child unto the dayof her death and it came to pass when the king sat in his house and the lordhad given him rest round about from all his enemies  that the kingsaid unto nathan the prophet see now i dwell in an house of cedarbut the ark of god dwelleth within curtains and nathan said to the king go do all that is in thine heartfor the lord is with thee and it came to pass that night that the word of the lord cameunto nathan saying  go and tell my servant david thus saith thelord shalt thou build me an house for me to dwell in   whereas ihave not dwelt in any house since the time that i brought up thechildren of israel out of egypt even to this day but have walked ina tent and in a tabernacle in all the places wherein i have walked with all the children ofisrael spake i a word with any of the tribes of israel whom icommanded to feed my people israel saying why build ye not me anhouse of cedar   now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servantdavid thus saith the lord of hosts i took thee from the sheepcotefrom following the sheep to be ruler over my people over israel and i was with thee whithersoever thou wentest and have cut off allthine enemies out of thy sight and have made thee a great name likeunto the name of the great men that are in the earth moreover i will appoint a place for my people israel and willplant them that they may dwell in a place of their own and move nomore neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any moreas beforetime  and as since the time that i commanded judges tobe over my people israel and have caused thee to rest from all thineenemies also the lord telleth thee that he will make thee an house and when thy days be fulfilled and thou shalt sleep with thyfathers i will set up thy seed after thee which shall proceed out ofthy bowels and i will establish his kingdom he shall build an house for my name and i will stablish thethrone of his kingdom for ever i will be his father and he shall be my son if he commitiniquity i will chasten him with the rod of men and with the stripesof the children of men  but my mercy shall not depart away fromhim as i took it from saul whom i put away before thee and thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for everbefore thee thy throne shall be established for ever according to all these words and according to all this visionso did nathan speak unto david then went king david in and sat before the lord and he saidwho am i o lord god and what is my house that thou hast brought mehitherto   and this was yet a small thing in thy sight o lordgod but thou hast spoken also of thy servants house for a greatwhile to come and is this the manner of man o lord god   andwhat can david say more unto thee for thou lord god knowest thyservant for thy words sake and according to thine own heart hast thoudone all these great things to make thy servant know them wherefore thou art great o lord god for there is none likethee neither is there any god beside thee according to all that wehave heard with our ears and what one nation in the earth is like thy people even likeisrael whom god went to redeem for a people to himself and to makehim a name and to do for you great things and terrible for thy landbefore thy people which thou redeemedst to thee from egypt from thenations and their gods   for thou hast confirmed to thyself thypeople israel to be a people unto thee for ever and thou lord artbecome their god and now o lord god the word that thou hast spoken concerningthy servant and concerning his house establish it for ever and doas thou hast said and let thy name be magnified for ever saying the lord of hostsis the god over israel and let the house of thy servant david beestablished before thee for thou o lord of hosts god of israel hast revealed to thyservant saying i will build thee an house therefore hath thyservant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee and now o lord god thou art that god and thy words be trueand thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant  thereforenow let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant that it maycontinue for ever before thee for thou o lord god hast spoken itand with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed forever and after this it came to pass that david smote the philistinesand subdued them and david took methegammah out of the hand of thephilistines and he smote moab and measured them with a line casting themdown to the ground even with two lines measured he to put to deathand with one full line to keep alive and so the moabites becamedavids servants and brought gifts david smote also hadadezer the son of rehob king of zobah as hewent to recover his border at the river euphrates and david took from him a thousand chariots and seven hundredhorsemen and twenty thousand footmen and david houghed all thechariot horses but reserved of them for an hundred chariots and when the syrians of damascus came to succour hadadezer king ofzobah david slew of the syrians two and twenty thousand men then david put garrisons in syria of damascus and the syriansbecame servants to david and brought gifts and the lord preserveddavid whithersoever he went and david took the shields of gold that were on the servants ofhadadezer and brought them to jerusalem and from betah and from berothai cities of hadadezer king davidtook exceeding much brass when toi king of hamath heard that david had smitten all the hostof hadadezer  then toi sent joram his son unto king david tosalute him and to bless him because he had fought against hadadezerand smitten him for hadadezer had wars with toi and joram broughtwith him vessels of silver and vessels of gold and vessels of brass which also king david did dedicate unto the lord with the silverand gold that he had dedicated of all nations which he subdued of syria and of moab and of the children of ammon and of thephilistines and of amalek and of the spoil of hadadezer son ofrehob king of zobah and david gat him a name when he returned from smiting of thesyrians in the valley of salt being eighteen thousand men and he put garrisons in edom throughout all edom put hegarrisons and all they of edom became davids servants and the lordpreserved david whithersoever he went and david reigned over all israel and david executed judgmentand justice unto all his people and joab the son of zeruiah was over the host and jehoshaphatthe son of ahilud was recorder  and zadok the son of ahitub andahimelech the son of abiathar were the priests and seraiah was thescribe  and benaiah the son of jehoiada was over both thecherethites and the pelethites and davids sons were chief rulers and david said is there yet any that is left of the house ofsaul that i may shew him kindness for jonathans sake   and therewas of the house of saul a servant whose name was ziba and when theyhad called him unto david the king said unto him art thou ziba  andhe said thy servant is he and the king said is there not yet any of the house of saul thati may shew the kindness of god unto him and ziba said unto the kingjonathan hath yet a son which is lame on his feet and the king said unto him where is he and ziba said unto theking behold he is in the house of machir the son of ammiel inlodebar then king david sent and fetched him out of the house of machirthe son of ammiel from lodebar now when mephibosheth the son of jonathan the son of saul wascome unto david he fell on his face and did reverence and davidsaid mephibosheth and he answered behold thy servant   anddavid said unto him fear not for i will surely shew thee kindnessfor jonathan thy fathers sake and will restore thee all the land ofsaul thy father and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually and he bowed himself and said what is thy servant that thoushouldest look upon such a dead dog as i am   then the king calledto ziba sauls servant and said unto him i have given unto thymasters son all that pertained to saul and to all his house thou therefore and thy sons and thy servants shall till theland for him and thou shalt bring in the fruits that thy mastersson may have food to eat but mephibosheth thy masters son shall eatbread alway at my table now ziba had fifteen sons and twentyservants then said ziba unto the king according to all that my lord theking hath commanded his servant so shall thy servant do as formephibosheth said the king he shall eat at my table as one of thekings sons and mephibosheth had a young son whose name was micha and allthat dwelt in the house of ziba were servants unto mephibosheth so mephibosheth dwelt in jerusalem for he did eat continually atthe kings table and was lame on both his feet and it came to pass after this that the king of the children ofammon died and hanun his son reigned in his stead then said david i will shew kindness unto hanun the son ofnahash as his father shewed kindness unto me and david sent tocomfort him by the hand of his servants for his father and davidsservants came into the land of the children of ammon and the princes of the children of ammon said unto hanun theirlord thinkest thou that david doth honour thy father that he hathsent comforters unto thee hath not david rather sent his servantsunto thee to search the city and to spy it out and to overthrow it wherefore hanun took davids servants and shaved off the onehalf of their beards and cut off their garments in the middle evento their buttocks and sent them away when they told it unto david he sent to meet them because themen were greatly ashamed and the king said tarry at jericho untilyour beards be grown and then return and when the children of ammon saw that they stank before davidthe children of ammon sent and hired the syrians of bethrehob and thesyrians of zoba twenty thousand footmen and of king maacah athousand men and of ishtob twelve thousand men and when david heard of it he sent joab and all the host of themighty men and the children of ammon came out and put the battle in arrayat the entering in of the gate and the syrians of zoba and of rehoband ishtob and maacah were by themselves in the field when joab saw that the front of the battle was against him beforeand behind he chose of all the choice men of israel and put them inarray against the syrians  and the rest of the people hedelivered into the hand of abishai his brother that he might put themin array against the children of ammon and he said if the syrians be too strong for me then thoushalt help me but if the children of ammon be too strong for theethen i will come and help thee be of good courage and let us play the men for our people andfor the cities of our god and the lord do that which seemeth himgood and joab drew nigh and the people that were with him unto thebattle against the syrians and they fled before him and when the children of ammon saw that the syrians were fledthen fled they also before abishai and entered into the city so joabreturned from the children of ammon and came to jerusalem and when the syrians saw that they were smitten before israelthey gathered themselves together and hadarezer sent and brought out the syrians that were beyondthe river and they came to helam and shobach the captain of the hostof hadarezer went before them and when it was told david he gathered all israel together andpassed over jordan and came to helam and the syrians set themselvesin array against david and fought with him and the syrians fled before israel and david slew the men ofseven hundred chariots of the syrians and forty thousand horsemenand smote shobach the captain of their host who died there and when all the kings that were servants to hadarezer saw thatthey were smitten before israel they made peace with israel andserved them so the syrians feared to help the children of ammon anymore and it came to pass after the year was expired at the time whenkings go forth to battle that david sent joab and his servants withhim and all israel and they destroyed the children of ammon andbesieged rabbah but david tarried still at jerusalem and it came to pass in an eveningtide that david arose from offhis bed and walked upon the roof of the kings house and from theroof he saw a woman washing herself and the woman was very beautifulto look upon and david sent and enquired after the woman and one said is notthis bathsheba the daughter of eliam the wife of uriah the hittite and david sent messengers and took her and she came in untohim and he lay with her for she was purified from her uncleannessand she returned unto her house and the woman conceived and sent and told david and said i amwith child and david sent to joab saying send me uriah the hittite andjoab sent uriah to david and when uriah was come unto him david demanded of him how joabdid and how the people did and how the war prospered and david said to uriah go down to thy house and wash thy feetand uriah departed out of the kings house and there followed him amess of meat from the king but uriah slept at the door of the kings house with all theservants of his lord and went not down to his house and when they had told david saying uriah went not down untohis house david said unto uriah camest thou not from thy journeywhy then didst thou not go down unto thine house   and uriahsaid unto david the ark and israel and judah abide in tents andmy lord joab and the servants of my lord are encamped in the openfields shall i then go into mine house to eat and to drink and tolie with my wife as thou livest and as thy soul liveth i will notdo this thing and david said to uriah tarry here to day also and to morrow iwill let thee depart so uriah abode in jerusalem that day and themorrow and when david had called him he did eat and drink before himand he made him drunk and at even he went out to lie on his bed withthe servants of his lord but went not down to his house and it came to pass in the morning that david wrote a letter tojoab and sent it by the hand of uriah and he wrote in the letter saying set ye uriah in theforefront of the hottest battle and retire ye from him that he maybe smitten and die and it came to pass when joab observed the city that heassigned uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men were and the men of the city went out and fought with joab andthere fell some of the people of the servants of david and uriah thehittite died also then joab sent and told david all the things concerning the war and charged the messenger saying when thou hast made an end oftelling the matters of the war unto the king  and if so be thatthe kings wrath arise and he say unto thee wherefore approached yeso nigh unto the city when ye did fight knew ye not that they wouldshoot from the wall   who smote abimelech the son ofjerubbesheth did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon himfrom the wall that he died in thebez why went ye nigh the wall thensay thou thy servant uriah the hittite is dead also so the messenger went and came and shewed david all that joabhad sent him for and the messenger said unto david surely the men prevailedagainst us and came out unto us into the field and we were upon themeven unto the entering of the gate and the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants andsome of the kings servants be dead and thy servant uriah the hittiteis dead also then david said unto the messenger thus shalt thou say untojoab let not this thing displease thee for the sword devoureth oneas well as another make thy battle more strong against the city andoverthrow it and encourage thou him and when the wife of uriah heard that uriah her husband wasdead she mourned for her husband and when the mourning was past david sent and fetched her tohis house and she became his wife and bare him a son but the thingthat david had done displeased the lord and the lord sent nathan unto david and he came unto him andsaid unto him there were two men in one city the one rich and theother poor the rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds  but thepoor man had nothing save one little ewe lamb which he had boughtand nourished up and it grew up together with him and with hischildren it did eat of his own meat and drank of his own cup andlay in his bosom and was unto him as a daughter and there came a traveller unto the rich man and he spared totake of his own flock and of his own herd to dress for the wayfaringman that was come unto him but took the poor mans lamb and dressedit for the man that was come to him and davids anger was greatly kindled against the man and hesaid to nathan as the lord liveth the man that hath done this thingshall surely die  and he shall restore the lamb fourfold becausehe did this thing and because he had no pity and nathan said to david thou art the man thus saith the lordgod of israel i anointed thee king over israel and i delivered theeout of the hand of saul  and i gave thee thy masters house andthy masters wives into thy bosom and gave thee the house of israeland of judah and if that had been too little i would moreover havegiven unto thee such and such things wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the lord to doevil in his sight thou hast killed uriah the hittite with the swordand hast taken his wife to be thy wife and hast slain him with thesword of the children of ammon now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine housebecause thou hast despised me and hast taken the wife of uriah thehittite to be thy wife thus saith the lord behold i will raise up evil against theeout of thine own house and i will take thy wives before thine eyesand give them unto thy neighbour and he shall lie with thy wives inthe sight of this sun for thou didst it secretly but i will do this thing before allisrael and before the sun and david said unto nathan i have sinned against the lord andnathan said unto david the lord also hath put away thy sin thoushalt not die howbeit because by this deed thou hast given great occasion tothe enemies of the lord to blaspheme the child also that is born untothee shall surely die and nathan departed unto his house and the lord struck thechild that uriahs wife bare unto david and it was very sick david therefore besought god for the child and david fastedand went in and lay all night upon the earth and the elders of his house arose and went to him to raise himup from the earth but he would not neither did he eat bread withthem and it came to pass on the seventh day that the child died andthe servants of david feared to tell him that the child was dead forthey said behold while the child was yet alive we spake unto himand he would not hearken unto our voice how will he then vex himselfif we tell him that the child is dead   but when david saw thathis servants whispered david perceived that the child was deadtherefore david said unto his servants is the child dead and theysaid he is dead then david arose from the earth and washed and anointedhimself and changed his apparel and came into the house of the lordand worshipped then he came to his own house and when he requiredthey set bread before him and he did eat then said his servants unto him what thing is this that thouhast done thou didst fast and weep for the child while it was alivebut when the child was dead thou didst rise and eat bread and he said while the child was yet alive i fasted and weptfor i said who can tell whether god will be gracious to me that thechild may live   but now he is dead wherefore should i fastcan i bring him back again i shall go to him but he shall not returnto me and david comforted bathsheba his wife and went in unto herand lay with her and she bare a son and he called his name solomonand the lord loved him and he sent by the hand of nathan the prophet and he called hisname jedidiah because of the lord and joab fought against rabbah of the children of ammon andtook the royal city and joab sent messengers to david and said i have foughtagainst rabbah and have taken the city of waters now therefore gather the rest of the people together and encampagainst the city and take it lest i take the city and it be calledafter my name and david gathered all the people together and went to rabbahand fought against it and took it and he took their kings crown from off his head the weightwhereof was a talent of gold with the precious stones and it was seton davids head and he brought forth the spoil of the city in greatabundance and he brought forth the people that were therein and put themunder saws and under harrows of iron and under axes of iron andmade them pass through the brickkiln and thus did he unto all thecities of the children of ammon so david and all the people returnedunto jerusalem and it came to pass after this that absalom the son of david hada fair sister whose name was tamar and amnon the son of david lovedher and amnon was so vexed that he fell sick for his sister tamarfor she was a virgin and amnon thought it hard for him to do anythingto her but amnon had a friend whose name was jonadab the son ofshimeah davids brother and jonadab was a very subtil man and he said unto him why art thou being the kings son leanfrom day to day wilt thou not tell me and amnon said unto him ilove tamar my brother absaloms sister and jonadab said unto him lay thee down on thy bed and makethyself sick and when thy father cometh to see thee say unto him ipray thee let my sister tamar come and give me meat and dress themeat in my sight that i may see it and eat it at her hand so amnon lay down and made himself sick and when the king wascome to see him amnon said unto the king i pray thee let tamar mysister come and make me a couple of cakes in my sight that i may eatat her hand then david sent home to tamar saying go now to thy brotheramnons house and dress him meat so tamar went to her brother amnons house and he was laid downand she took flour and kneaded it and made cakes in his sight anddid bake the cakes and she took a pan and poured them out before him but herefused to eat and amnon said have out all men from me and theywent out every man from him and amnon said unto tamar bring the meat into the chamber thati may eat of thine hand and tamar took the cakes which she had madeand brought them into the chamber to amnon her brother and when she had brought them unto him to eat he took hold ofher and said unto her come lie with me my sister and she answered him nay my brother do not force me for nosuch thing ought to be done in israel do not thou this folly and i whither shall i cause my shame to go and as for theethou shalt be as one of the fools in israel now therefore i praythee speak unto the king for he will not withhold me from thee howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice but being strongerthan she forced her and lay with her then amnon hated her exceedingly so that the hatred wherewithhe hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her andamnon said unto her arise be gone and she said unto him there is no cause this evil in sendingme away is greater than the other that thou didst unto me but hewould not hearken unto her then he called his servant that ministered unto him and saidput now this woman out from me and bolt the door after her and she had a garment of divers colours upon her for with suchrobes were the kings daughters that were virgins apparelled then hisservant brought her out and bolted the door after her and tamar put ashes on her head and rent her garment of diverscolours that was on her and laid her hand on her head and went oncrying and absalom her brother said unto her hath amnon thy brotherbeen with thee but hold now thy peace my sister he is thy brotherregard not this thing so tamar remained desolate in her brotherabsaloms house but when king david heard of all these things he was verywroth and absalom spake unto his brother amnon neither good nor badfor absalom hated amnon because he had forced his sister tamar and it came to pass after two full years that absalom hadsheepshearers in baalhazor which is beside ephraim and absalominvited all the kings sons and absalom came to the king and said behold now thy servanthath sheepshearers let the king i beseech thee and his servants gowith thy servant and the king said to absalom nay my son let us not all nowgo lest we be chargeable unto thee and he pressed him howbeit hewould not go but blessed him then said absalom if not i pray thee let my brother amnon gowith us and the king said unto him why should he go with thee but absalom pressed him that he let amnon and all the kingssons go with him now absalom had commanded his servants saying mark ye now whenamnons heart is merry with wine and when i say unto you smiteamnon then kill him fear not have not i commanded you becourageous and be valiant and the servants of absalom did unto amnon as absalom hadcommandedthen all the kings sons arose and every man gat him up upon hismule and fled and it came to pass while they were in the way that tidingscame to david saying absalom hath slain all the kings sons andthere is not one of them left then the king arose and tare his garments and lay on theearth and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent and jonadab the son of shimeah davids brother answered andsaid let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the young menthe kings sons for amnon only is dead for by the appointment ofabsalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced hissister tamar now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to hisheart to think that all the kings sons are dead for amnon only isdead but absalom fled and the young man that kept the watch liftedup his eyes and looked and behold there came much people by theway of the hill side behind him and jonadab said unto the king behold the kings sons come asthy servant said so it is and it came to pass as soon as he had made an end of speakingthat behold the kings sons came and lifted up their voice andwept and the king also and all his servants wept very sore but absalom fled and went to talmai the son of ammihud kingof geshur and david mourned for his son every day so absalom fled and went to geshur and was there three years and the soul of king david longed to go forth unto absalom forhe was comforted concerning amnon seeing he was dead now joab the son of zeruiah perceived that the kings heart wastoward absalom and joab sent to tekoah and fetched thence a wise woman andsaid unto her i pray thee feign thyself to be a mourner and put onnow mourning apparel and anoint not thyself with oil but be as awoman that had a long time mourned for the dead  and come to theking and speak on this manner unto him so joab put the words in hermouth and when the woman of tekoah spake to the king she fell on herface to the ground and did obeisance and said help o king and the king said unto her what aileth thee and she answered iam indeed a widow woman and mine husband is dead and thy handmaid had two sons and they two strove together inthe field and there was none to part them but the one smote theother and slew him and behold the whole family is risen against thine handmaidand they said deliver him that smote his brother that we may killhim for the life of his brother whom he slew and we will destroy theheir also and so they shall quench my coal which is left and shallnot leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the earth and the king said unto the woman go to thine house and i willgive charge concerning thee and the woman of tekoah said unto the king my lord o king theiniquity be on me and on my fathers house and the king and histhrone be guiltless and the king said whoever saith ought unto thee bring him tome and he shall not touch thee any more then said she i pray thee let the king remember the lord thygod that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of blood to destroyany more lest they destroy my son and he said as the lord liveththere shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth then the woman said let thine handmaid i pray thee speak oneword unto my lord the king and he said say on and the woman said wherefore then hast thou thought such athing against the people of god for the king doth speak this thing asone which is faulty in that the king doth not fetch home again hisbanished for we must needs die and are as water spilt on the groundwhich cannot be gathered up again neither doth god respect anyperson yet doth he devise means that his banished be not expelledfrom him now therefore that i am come to speak of this thing unto my lordthe king it is because the people have made me afraid and thyhandmaid said i will now speak unto the king it may be that the kingwill perform the request of his handmaid for the king will hear to deliver his handmaid out of the handof the man that would destroy me and my son together out of theinheritance of god then thine handmaid said the word of my lord the king shall nowbe comfortable for as an angel of god so is my lord the king todiscern good and bad therefore the lord thy god will be with thee then the king answered and said unto the woman hide not fromme i pray thee the thing that i shall ask thee and the woman saidlet my lord the king now speak and the king said is not the hand of joab with thee in allthis  and the woman answered and said as thy soul liveth my lordthe king none can turn to the right hand or to the left from oughtthat my lord the king hath spoken for thy servant joab he bade meand he put all these words in the mouth of thine handmaid  tofetch about this form of speech hath thy servant joab done this thingand my lord is wise according to the wisdom of an angel of god toknow all things that are in the earth and the king said unto joab behold now i have done this thinggo therefore bring the young man absalom again and joab fell to the ground on his face and bowed himself andthanked the king and joab said to day thy servant knoweth that ihave found grace in thy sight my lord o king in that the king hathfulfilled the request of his servant so joab arose and went to geshur and brought absalom tojerusalem and the king said let him turn to his own house and let himnot see my face so absalom returned to his own house and saw not thekings face but in all israel there was none to be so much praised asabsalom for his beauty from the sole of his foot even to the crown ofhis head there was no blemish in him and when he polled his head for it was at every years endthat he polled it because the hair was heavy on him therefore hepolled it he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekelsafter the kings weight and unto absalom there were born three sons and one daughterwhose name was tamar she was a woman of a fair countenance so absalom dwelt two full years in jerusalem and saw not thekings face therefore absalom sent for joab to have sent him to the kingbut he would not come to him and when he sent again the second timehe would not come therefore he said unto his servants see joabs field is nearmine and he hath barley there go and set it on fire and absalomsservants set the field on fire then joab arose and came to absalom unto his house and saidunto him wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire   andabsalom answered joab behold i sent unto thee saying come hitherthat i may send thee to the king to say wherefore am i come fromgeshur it had been good for me to have been there still nowtherefore let me see the kings face and if there be any iniquity inme let him kill me so joab came to the king and told him and when he had calledfor absalom he came to the king and bowed himself on his face to theground before the king and the king kissed absalom and it came to pass after this that absalom prepared himchariots and horses and fifty men to run before him and absalom rose up early and stood beside the way of the gateand it was so that when any man that had a controversy came to theking for judgment then absalom called unto him and said of whatcity art thou and he said thy servant is of one of the tribes ofisrael and absalom said unto him see thy matters are good and rightbut there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee absalom said moreover oh that i were made judge in the landthat every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me and iwould do him justice   and it was so that when any man came nighto him to do him obeisance he put forth his hand and took him andkissed him and on this manner did absalom to all israel that came to theking for judgment so absalom stole the hearts of the men of israel and it came to pass after forty years that absalom said unto theking i pray thee let me go and pay my vow which i have vowed untothe lord in hebron for thy servant vowed a vow while i abode at geshur in syriasaying if the lord shall bring me again indeed to jerusalem then iwill serve the lord and the king said unto him go in peace so he arose and went tohebron but absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of israelsaying as soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet then ye shallsay absalom reigneth in hebron and with absalom went two hundred men out of jerusalem thatwere called and they went in their simplicity and they knew not anything and absalom sent for ahithophel the gilonite davidscounsellor from his city even from giloh while he offeredsacrifices and the conspiracy was strong for the people increasedcontinually with absalom and there came a messenger to david saying the hearts of themen of israel are after absalom and david said unto all his servants that were with him atjerusalem arise and let us flee for we shall not else escape fromabsalom make speed to depart lest he overtake us suddenly and bringevil upon us and smite the city with the edge of the sword and the kings servants said unto the king behold thy servantsare ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint and the king went forth and all his household after him andthe king left ten women which were concubines to keep the house and the king went forth and all the people after him andtarried in a place that was far off and all his servants passed on beside him and all thecherethites and all the pelethites and all the gittites six hundredmen which came after him from gath passed on before the king then said the king to ittai the gittite wherefore goest thoualso with us return to thy place and abide with the king for thouart a stranger and also an exile whereas thou camest but yesterday should i this day make theego up and down with us seeing i go whither i may return thou andtake back thy brethren mercy and truth be with thee and ittai answered the king and said as the lord liveth andas my lord the king liveth surely in what place my lord the kingshall be whether in death or life even there also will thy servantbe and david said to ittai go and pass over and ittai the gittitepassed over and all his men and all the little ones that were withhim and all the country wept with a loud voice and all the peoplepassed over the king also himself passed over the brook kidron andall the people passed over toward the way of the wilderness and lo zadok also and all the levites were with him bearingthe ark of the covenant of god and they set down the ark of god andabiathar went up until all the people had done passing out of thecity and the king said unto zadok carry back the ark of god into thecity if i shall find favour in the eyes of the lord he will bring meagain and shew me both it and his habitation  but if he thussay i have no delight in thee behold here am i let him do to me asseemeth good unto him the king said also unto zadok the priest art not thou a seerreturn into the city in peace and your two sons with you ahimaaz thyson and jonathan the son of abiathar see i will tarry in the plain of the wilderness until therecome word from you to certify me zadok therefore and abiathar carried the ark of god again tojerusalem and they tarried there and david went up by the ascent of mount olivet and wept as hewent up and had his head covered and he went barefoot and all thepeople that was with him covered every man his head and they went upweeping as they went up and one told david saying ahithophel is among the conspiratorswith absalom and david said o lord i pray thee turn the counsel ofahithophel into foolishness and it came to pass that when david was come to the top of themount where he worshipped god behold hushai the archite came tomeet him with his coat rent and earth upon his head  unto whomdavid said if thou passest on with me then thou shalt be a burdenunto me  but if thou return to the city and say unto absalom iwill be thy servant o king as i have been thy fathers servanthitherto so will i now also be thy servant then mayest thou for medefeat the counsel of ahithophel and hast thou not there with thee zadok and abiathar thepriests  therefore it shall be that what thing soever thou shalthear out of the kings house thou shalt tell it to zadok and abiatharthe priests behold they have there with them their two sons ahimaazzadoks son and jonathan abiathars son and by them ye shall sendunto me every thing that ye can hear so hushai davids friend came into the city and absalom cameinto jerusalem and when david was a little past the top of the hill beholdziba the servant of mephibosheth met him with a couple of assessaddled and upon them two hundred loaves of bread and an hundredbunches of raisins and an hundred of summer fruits and a bottle ofwine and the king said unto ziba what meanest thou by these and zibasaid the asses be for the kings household to ride on and the breadand summer fruit for the young men to eat and the wine that such asbe faint in the wilderness may drink and the king said and where is thy masters son and ziba saidunto the king behold he abideth at jerusalem for he said to dayshall the house of israel restore me the kingdom of my father then said the king to ziba behold thine are all that pertainedunto mephibosheth and ziba said i humbly beseech thee that i mayfind grace in thy sight my lord o king and when king david came to bahurim behold thence came out aman of the family of the house of saul whose name was shimei the sonof gera he came forth and cursed still as he came and he cast stones at david and at all the servants of kingdavid and all the people and all the mighty men were on his righthand and on his left and thus said shimei when he cursed come out come out thoubloody man and thou man of belial  the lord hath returned uponthee all the blood of the house of saul in whose stead thou hastreigned and the lord hath delivered the kingdom into the hand ofabsalom thy son and behold thou art taken in thy mischief becausethou art a bloody man then said abishai the son of zeruiah unto the king why shouldthis dead dog curse my lord the king let me go over i pray thee andtake off his head and the king said what have i to do with you ye sons ofzeruiah  so let him curse because the lord hath said unto him cursedavid who shall then say wherefore hast thou done so   anddavid said to abishai and to all his servants behold my son whichcame forth of my bowels seeketh my life how much more now may thisbenjamite do it let him alone and let him curse for the lord hathbidden him it may be that the lord will look on mine affliction and thatthe lord will requite me good for his cursing this day and as david and his men went by the way shimei went along onthe hills side over against him and cursed as he went and threwstones at him and cast dust and the king and all the people that were with him came wearyand refreshed themselves there and absalom and all the people the men of israel came tojerusalem and ahithophel with him and it came to pass when hushai the archite davids friendwas come unto absalom that hushai said unto absalom god save theking god save the king and absalom said to hushai is this thy kindness to thy friendwhy wentest thou not with thy friend   and hushai said untoabsalom nay but whom the lord and this people and all the men ofisrael choose his will i be and with him will i abide and again whom should i serve should i not serve in thepresence of his son as i have served in thy fathers presence sowill i be in thy presence then said absalom to ahithophel give counsel among you what weshall do and ahithophel said unto absalom go in unto thy fathersconcubines which he hath left to keep the house and all israel shallhear that thou art abhorred of thy father then shall the hands of allthat are with thee be strong so they spread absalom a tent upon the top of the house andabsalom went in unto his fathers concubines in the sight of allisrael and the counsel of ahithophel which he counselled in thosedays was as if a man had enquired at the oracle of god so was allthe counsel of ahithophel both with david and with absalom moreover ahithophel said unto absalom let me now choose outtwelve thousand men and i will arise and pursue after david thisnight  and i will come upon him while he is weary and weakhanded and will make him afraid and all the people that are with himshall flee and i will smite the king only  and i will bring backall the people unto thee the man whom thou seekest is as if allreturned so all the people shall be in peace and the saying pleased absalom well and all the elders ofisrael then said absalom call now hushai the archite also and let ushear likewise what he saith and when hushai was come to absalom absalom spake unto himsaying ahithophel hath spoken after this manner shall we do afterhis saying if not speak thou and hushai said unto absalom the counsel that ahithophel hathgiven is not good at this time for said hushai thou knowest thy father and his men that theybe mighty men and they be chafed in their minds as a bear robbed ofher whelps in the field and thy father is a man of war and will notlodge with the people behold he is hid now in some pit or in some other place and itwill come to pass when some of them be overthrown at the first thatwhosoever heareth it will say there is a slaughter among the peoplethat follow absalom and he also that is valiant whose heart is as the heart of alion shall utterly melt for all israel knoweth that thy father is amighty man and they which be with him are valiant men therefore i counsel that all israel be generally gathered untothee from dan even to beersheba as the sand that is by the sea formultitude and that thou go to battle in thine own person so shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be foundand we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground and ofhim and of all the men that are with him there shall not be left somuch as one moreover if he be gotten into a city then shall all israelbring ropes to that city and we will draw it into the river untilthere be not one small stone found there and absalom and all the men of israel said the counsel ofhushai the archite is better than the counsel of ahithophel for thelord had appointed to defeat the good counsel of ahithophel to theintent that the lord might bring evil upon absalom then said hushai unto zadok and to abiathar the priests thusand thus did ahithophel counsel absalom and the elders of israel andthus and thus have i counselled now therefore send quickly and tell david saying lodge notthis night in the plains of the wilderness but speedily pass overlest the king be swallowed up and all the people that are with him now jonathan and ahimaaz stayed by enrogel for they might notbe seen to come into the city and a wench went and told them andthey went and told king david nevertheless a lad saw them and told absalom but they wentboth of them away quickly and came to a mans house in bahurim whichhad a well in his court whither they went down and the woman took and spread a covering over the wells mouthand spread ground corn thereon and the thing was not known and when absaloms servants came to the woman to the house theysaid where is ahimaaz and jonathan and the woman said unto themthey be gone over the brook of water and when they had sought andcould not find them they returned to jerusalem and it came to pass after they were departed that they came upout of the well and went and told king david and said unto davidarise and pass quickly over the water for thus hath ahithophelcounselled against you then david arose and all the people that were with him andthey passed over jordan by the morning light there lacked not one ofthem that was not gone over jordan and when ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed hesaddled his ass and arose and gat him home to his house to hiscity and put his household in order and hanged himself and diedand was buried in the sepulchre of his father then david came to mahanaim and absalom passed over jordan heand all the men of israel with him and absalom made amasa captain of the host instead of joabwhich amasa was a mans son whose name was ithra an israelite thatwent in to abigail the daughter of nahash sister to zeruiah joabsmother so israel and absalom pitched in the land of gilead and it came to pass when david was come to mahanaim that shobithe son of nahash of rabbah of the children of ammon and machir theson of ammiel of lodebar and barzillai the gileadite of rogelim brought beds and basons and earthen vessels and wheat andbarley and flour and parched corn and beans and lentiles andparched pulse  and honey and butter and sheep and cheese ofkine for david and for the people that were with him to eat forthey said the people is hungry and weary and thirsty in thewilderness and david numbered the people that were with him and setcaptains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them and david sent forth a third part of the people under the hand ofjoab and a third part under the hand of abishai the son of zeruiahjoabs brother and a third part under the hand of ittai the gittiteand the king said unto the people i will surely go forth with youmyself also but the people answered thou shalt not go forth for if we fleeaway they will not care for us neither if half of us die will theycare for us but now thou art worth ten thousand of us therefore nowit is better that thou succour us out of the city and the king said unto them what seemeth you best i will do andthe king stood by the gate side and all the people came out byhundreds and by thousands and the king commanded joab and abishai and ittai saying dealgently for my sake with the young man even with absalom and all thepeople heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerningabsalom so the people went out into the field against israel and thebattle was in the wood of ephraim  where the people of israelwere slain before the servants of david and there was there a greatslaughter that day of twenty thousand men for the battle was there scattered over the face of all thecountry and the wood devoured more people that day than the sworddevoured and absalom met the servants of david and absalom rode upon amule and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak and hishead caught hold of the oak and he was taken up between the heavenand the earth and the mule that was under him went away and a certain man saw it and told joab and said behold i sawabsalom hanged in an oak and joab said unto the man that told him and behold thousawest him and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground andi would have given thee ten shekels of silver and a girdle and the man said unto joab though i should receive a thousandshekels of silver in mine hand yet would i not put forth mine handagainst the kings son for in our hearing the king charged thee andabishai and ittai saying beware that none touch the young manabsalom otherwise i should have wrought falsehood against mine own lifefor there is no matter hid from the king and thou thyself wouldesthave set thyself against me then said joab i may not tarry thus with thee and he tookthree darts in his hand and thrust them through the heart of absalomwhile he was yet alive in the midst of the oak and ten young men that bare joabs armour compassed about andsmote absalom and slew him and joab blew the trumpet and the people returned from pursuingafter israel for joab held back the people and they took absalom and cast him into a great pit in thewood and laid a very great heap of stones upon him and all israelfled every one to his tent now absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himselfa pillar which is in the kings dale for he said i have no son tokeep my name in remembrance and he called the pillar after his ownname and it is called unto this day absaloms place then said ahimaaz the son of zadok let me now run and bear theking tidings how that the lord hath avenged him of his enemies and joab said unto him thou shalt not bear tidings this daybut thou shalt bear tidings another day but this day thou shalt bearno tidings because the kings son is dead then said joab to cushi go tell the king what thou hast seenand cushi bowed himself unto joab and ran then said ahimaaz the son of zadok yet again to joab buthowsoever let me i pray thee also run after cushi and joab saidwherefore wilt thou run my son seeing that thou hast no tidingsready   but howsoever said he let me run and he said untohim run then ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain and overran cushi and david sat between the two gates and the watchman went up tothe roof over the gate unto the wall and lifted up his eyes andlooked and behold a man running alone and the watchman cried and told the king and the king said ifhe be alone there is tidings in his mouth and he came apace anddrew near and the watchman saw another man running and the watchmancalled unto the porter and said behold another man running aloneand the king said he also bringeth tidings and the watchman said me thinketh the running of the foremostis like the running of ahimaaz the son of zadok and the king said heis a good man and cometh with good tidings and ahimaaz called and said unto the king all is well and hefell down to the earth upon his face before the king and saidblessed be the lord thy god which hath delivered up the men thatlifted up their hand against my lord the king and the king said is the young man absalom safe and ahimaazanswered when joab sent the kings servant and me thy servant i sawa great tumult but i knew not what it was and the king said unto him turn aside and stand here and heturned aside and stood still and behold cushi came and cushi said tidings my lord theking for the lord hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose upagainst thee and the king said unto cushi is the young man absalom safe andcushi answered the enemies of my lord the king and all that riseagainst thee to do thee hurt be as that young man is and the king was much moved and went up to the chamber over thegate and wept and as he went thus he said o my son absalom myson my son absalom would god i had died for thee o absalom my sonmy son   and it was told joab behold the king weepeth andmourneth for absalom and the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all thepeople for the people heard say that day how the king was grieved forhis son and the people gat them by stealth that day into the city aspeople being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle but the king covered his face and the king cried with a loudvoice o my son absalom o absalom my son my son   and joabcame into the house to the king and said thou hast shamed this daythe faces of all thy servants which this day have saved thy life andthe lives of thy sons and of thy daughters and the lives of thywives and the lives of thy concubines  in that thou lovest thineenemies and hatest thy friends for thou hast declared this day thatthou regardest neither princes nor servants for this day i perceivethat if absalom had lived and all we had died this day then it hadpleased thee well now therefore arise go forth and speak comfortably unto thyservants for i swear by the lord if thou go not forth there willnot tarry one with thee this night and that will be worse unto theethan all the evil that befell thee from thy youth until now then the king arose and sat in the gate and they told unto allthe people saying behold the king doth sit in the gate and all thepeople came before the king for israel had fled every man to histent and all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes ofisrael saying the king saved us out of the hand of our enemies andhe delivered us out of the hand of the philistines and now he is fledout of the land for absalom and absalom whom we anointed over us is dead in battle nowtherefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back  and king david sent to zadok and to abiathar the priests sayingspeak unto the elders of judah saying why are ye the last to bringthe king back to his house seeing the speech of all israel is come tothe king even to his house ye are my brethren ye are my bones and my flesh wherefore thenare ye the last to bring back the king   and say ye to amasaart thou not of my bone and of my flesh god do so to me and morealso if thou be not captain of the host before me continually in theroom of joab and he bowed the heart of all the men of judah even as theheart of one man so that they sent this word unto the king returnthou and all thy servants so the king returned and came to jordan and judah came togilgal to go to meet the king to conduct the king over jordan and shimei the son of gera a benjamite which was of bahurimhasted and came down with the men of judah to meet king david and there were a thousand men of benjamin with him and ziba theservant of the house of saul and his fifteen sons and his twentyservants with him and they went over jordan before the king and there went over a ferry boat to carry over the kingshousehold and to do what he thought good and shimei the son of gerafell down before the king as he was come over jordan  and saidunto the king let not my lord impute iniquity unto me neither dothou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that mylord the king went out of jerusalem that the king should take it tohis heart for thy servant doth know that i have sinned therefore beholdi am come the first this day of all the house of joseph to go down tomeet my lord the king but abishai the son of zeruiah answered and said shall notshimei be put to death for this because he cursed the lordsanointed   and david said what have i to do with you ye sonsof zeruiah that ye should this day be adversaries unto me shallthere any man be put to death this day in israel for do not i knowthat i am this day king over israel   therefore the king saidunto shimei thou shalt not die and the king sware unto him and mephibosheth the son of saul came down to meet the king andhad neither dressed his feet nor trimmed his beard nor washed hisclothes from the day the king departed until the day he came again inpeace and it came to pass when he was come to jerusalem to meet theking that the king said unto him wherefore wentest not thou with memephibosheth   and he answered my lord o king my servantdeceived me for thy servant said i will saddle me an ass that i mayride thereon and go to the king because thy servant is lame and he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king but mylord the king is as an angel of god do therefore what is good inthine eyes for all of my fathers house were but dead men before my lordthe king yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat atthine own table what right therefore have i yet to cry any more untothe king   and the king said unto him why speakest thou anymore of thy matters i have said thou and ziba divide the land and mephibosheth said unto the king yea let him take allforasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his ownhouse and barzillai the gileadite came down from rogelim and wentover jordan with the king to conduct him over jordan now barzillai was a very aged man even fourscore years old andhe had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at mahanaim forhe was a very great man and the king said unto barzillai come thou over with me and iwill feed thee with me in jerusalem and barzillai said unto the king how long have i to live thati should go up with the king unto jerusalem   i am this dayfourscore years old and can i discern between good and evil can thyservant taste what i eat or what i drink can i hear any more thevoice of singing men and singing women wherefore then should thyservant be yet a burden unto my lord the king   thy servant willgo a little way over jordan with the king and why should the kingrecompense it me with such a reward   let thy servant i praythee turn back again that i may die in mine own city and be buriedby the grave of my father and of my mother but behold thy servantchimham let him go over with my lord the king and do to him whatshall seem good unto thee and the king answered chimham shall go over with me and i willdo to him that which shall seem good unto thee and whatsoever thoushalt require of me that will i do for thee and all the people went over jordan and when the king was comeover the king kissed barzillai and blessed him and he returned untohis own place then the king went on to gilgal and chimham went on with himand all the people of judah conducted the king and also half thepeople of israel and behold all the men of israel came to the king and saidunto the king why have our brethren the men of judah stolen theeaway and have brought the king and his household and all davidsmen with him over jordan   and all the men of judah answeredthe men of israel because the king is near of kin to us whereforethen be ye angry for this matter have we eaten at all of the kingscost or hath he given us any gift   and the men of israelanswered the men of judah and said we have ten parts in the kingand we have also more right in david than ye why then did ye despiseus that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our kingand the words of the men of judah were fiercer than the words of themen of israel and there happened to be there a man of belial whose name wassheba the son of bichri a benjamite and he blew a trumpet andsaid we have no part in david neither have we inheritance in the sonof jesse every man to his tents o israel so every man of israel went up from after david and followedsheba the son of bichri but the men of judah clave unto their kingfrom jordan even to jerusalem and david came to his house at jerusalem and the king took theten women his concubines whom he had left to keep the house and putthem in ward and fed them but went not in unto them so they wereshut up unto the day of their death living in widowhood then said the king to amasa assemble me the men of judah withinthree days and be thou here present so amasa went to assemble the men of judah but he tarried longerthan the set time which he had appointed him and david said to abishai now shall sheba the son of bichri dous more harm than did absalom take thou thy lords servants andpursue after him lest he get him fenced cities and escape us and there went out after him joabs men and the cherethites andthe pelethites and all the mighty men and they went out ofjerusalem to pursue after sheba the son of bichri when they were at the great stone which is in gibeon amasa wentbefore them and joabs garment that he had put on was girded untohim and upon it a girdle with a sword fastened upon his loins in thesheath thereof and as he went forth it fell out and joab said to amasa art thou in health my brother and joabtook amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him but amasa took no heed to the sword that was in joabs hand sohe smote him therewith in the fifth rib and shed out his bowels tothe ground and struck him not again and he died so joab and abishaihis brother pursued after sheba the son of bichri and one of joabs men stood by him and said he that favourethjoab and he that is for david let him go after joab and amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway andwhen the man saw that all the people stood still he removed amasa outof the highway into the field and cast a cloth upon him when he sawthat every one that came by him stood still when he was removed out of the highway all the people went onafter joab to pursue after sheba the son of bichri and he went through all the tribes of israel unto abel and tobethmaachah and all the berites and they were gathered together andwent also after him and they came and besieged him in abel of bethmaachah and theycast up a bank against the city and it stood in the trench and allthe people that were with joab battered the wall to throw it down then cried a wise woman out of the city hear hear say i prayyou unto joab come near hither that i may speak with thee and when he was come near unto her the woman said art thoujoab  and he answered i am he then she said unto him hear thewords of thine handmaid and he answered i do hear then she spake saying they were wont to speak in old timesaying they shall surely ask counsel at abel and so they ended thematter i am one of them that are peaceable and faithful in israel thouseekest to destroy a city and a mother in israel why wilt thouswallow up the inheritance of the lord   and joab answered andsaid far be it far be it from me that i should swallow up ordestroy the matter is not so but a man of mount ephraim sheba the sonof bichri by name hath lifted up his hand against the king evenagainst david deliver him only and i will depart from the city andthe woman said unto joab behold his head shall be thrown to theeover the wall then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom and theycut off the head of sheba the son of bichri and cast it out to joaband he blew a trumpet and they retired from the city every man tohis tent and joab returned to jerusalem unto the king now joab was over all the host of israel and benaiah the son ofjehoiada was over the cherethites and over the pelethites  andadoram was over the tribute and jehoshaphat the son of ahilud wasrecorder  and sheva was scribe and zadok and abiathar were thepriests  and ira also the jairite was a chief ruler about david then there was a famine in the days of david three years yearafter year and david enquired of the lord and the lord answered itis for saul and for his bloody house because he slew the gibeonites and the king called the gibeonites and said unto them now thegibeonites were not of the children of israel but of the remnant ofthe amorites and the children of israel had sworn unto them and saulsought to slay them in his zeal to the children of israel and judah wherefore david said unto the gibeonites what shall i do foryou  and wherewith shall i make the atonement that ye may bless theinheritance of the lord   and the gibeonites said unto him wewill have no silver nor gold of saul nor of his house neither for usshalt thou kill any man in israel and he said what ye shall saythat will i do for you and they answered the king the man that consumed us and thatdevised against us that we should be destroyed from remaining in anyof the coasts of israel  let seven men of his sons be deliveredunto us and we will hang them up unto the lord in gibeah of saulwhom the lord did choose and the king said i will give them but the king spared mephibosheth the son of jonathan the son ofsaul because of the lords oath that was between them between davidand jonathan the son of saul but the king took the two sons of rizpah the daughter of aiahwhom she bare unto saul armoni and mephibosheth and the five sons ofmichal the daughter of saul whom she brought up for adriel the son ofbarzillai the meholathite  and he delivered them into the handsof the gibeonites and they hanged them in the hill before the lordand they fell all seven together and were put to death in the days ofharvest in the first days in the beginning of barley harvest and rizpah the daughter of aiah took sackcloth and spread itfor her upon the rock from the beginning of harvest until waterdropped upon them out of heaven and suffered neither the birds of theair to rest on them by day nor the beasts of the field by night and it was told david what rizpah the daughter of aiah theconcubine of saul had done and david went and took the bones of saul and the bones ofjonathan his son from the men of jabeshgilead which had stolen themfrom the street of bethshan where the philistines had hanged themwhen the philistines had slain saul in gilboa  and he brought upfrom thence the bones of saul and the bones of jonathan his son andthey gathered the bones of them that were hanged and the bones of saul and jonathan his son buried they in thecountry of benjamin in zelah in the sepulchre of kish his father andthey performed all that the king commanded and after that god wasintreated for the land moreover the philistines had yet war again with israel anddavid went down and his servants with him and fought against thephilistines and david waxed faint and ishbibenob which was of the sons of the giant the weightof whose spear weighed three hundred shekels of brass in weight hebeing girded with a new sword thought to have slain david but abishai the son of zeruiah succoured him and smote thephilistine and killed him then the men of david sware unto himsaying thou shalt go no more out with us to battle that thou quenchnot the light of israel and it came to pass after this that there was again a battlewith the philistines at gob then sibbechai the hushathite slew saphwhich was of the sons of the giant and there was again a battle in gob with the philistines whereelhanan the son of jaareoregim a bethlehemite slew the brother ofgoliath the gittite the staff of whose spear was like a weaversbeam and there was yet a battle in gath where was a man of greatstature that had on every hand six fingers and on every foot sixtoes four and twenty in number and he also was born to the giant and when he defied israel jonathan the son of shimeah thebrother of david slew him these four were born to the giant in gath and fell by the handof david and by the hand of his servants and david spake unto the lord the words of this song in the daythat the lord had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemiesand out of the hand of saul  and he said the lord is my rockand my fortress and my deliverer  the god of my rock in himwill i trust he is my shield and the horn of my salvation my hightower and my refuge my saviour thou savest me from violence i will call on the lord who is worthy to be praised so shall ibe saved from mine enemies when the waves of death compassed me the floods of ungodly menmade me afraid  the sorrows of hell compassed me about thesnares of death prevented me  in my distress i called upon thelord and cried to my god and he did hear my voice out of his templeand my cry did enter into his ears then the earth shook and trembled the foundations of heavenmoved and shook because he was wroth there went up a smoke out of his nostrils and fire out of hismouth devoured coals were kindled by it he bowed the heavens also and came down and darkness was underhis feet and he rode upon a cherub and did fly and he was seen upon thewings of the wind and he made darkness pavilions round about him dark waters andthick clouds of the skies through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled the lord thundered from heaven and the most high uttered hisvoice and he sent out arrows and scattered them lightning anddiscomfited them and the channels of the sea appeared the foundations of theworld were discovered at the rebuking of the lord at the blast ofthe breath of his nostrils he sent from above he took me he drew me out of many waters he delivered me from my strong

tower of salvation for his king and sheweth mercy tohis anointed unto david and to his seed for evermore now these be the last words of david david the son of jessesaid and the man who was raised up on high the anointed of the godof jacob and the sweet psalmist of israel said  the spirit ofthe lord spake by me and his word was in my tongue the god of israel said the rock of israel spake to me he thatruleth over men must be just ruling in the fear of god and he shall be as the light of the morning when the sun risetheven a morning without clouds as the tender grass springing out ofthe earth by clear shining after rain although my house be not so with god yet he hath made with me aneverlasting covenant ordered in all things and sure for this is allmy salvation and all my desire although he make it not to grow but the sons of belial shall be all of them as thorns thrustaway because they cannot be taken with hands  but the man thatshall touch them must be fenced with iron and the staff of a spearand they shall be utterly burned with fire in the same place these be the names of the mighty men whom david had thetachmonite that sat in the seat chief among the captains the samewas adino the eznite he lift up his spear against eight hundred whomhe slew at one time and after him was eleazar the son of dodo the ahohite one of thethree mighty men with david when they defied the philistines thatwere there gathered together to battle and the men of israel weregone away  he arose and smote the philistines until his handwas weary and his hand clave unto the sword and the lord wrought agreat victory that day and the people returned after him only tospoil and after him was shammah the son of agee the hararite and thephilistines were gathered together into a troop where was a piece ofground full of lentiles and the people fled from the philistines but he stood in the midst of the ground and defended it andslew the philistines and the lord wrought a great victory and three of the thirty chief went down and came to david inthe harvest time unto the cave of adullam and the troop of thephilistines pitched in the valley of rephaim and david was then in an hold and the garrison of thephilistines was then in bethlehem and david longed and said oh that one would give me drink ofthe water of the well of bethlehem which is by the gate   andthe three mighty men brake through the host of the philistines anddrew water out of the well of bethlehem that was by the gate andtook it and brought it to david nevertheless he would not drinkthereof but poured it out unto the lord and he said be it far from me o lord that i should do thisis not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their livestherefore he would not drink it these things did these three mightymen and abishai the brother of joab the son of zeruiah was chiefamong three and he lifted up his spear against three hundred andslew them and had the name among three was he not most honourable of three therefore he was theircaptain howbeit he attained not unto the first three and benaiah the son of jehoiada the son of a valiant man ofkabzeel who had done many acts he slew two lionlike men of moab hewent down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow and he slew an egyptian a goodly man and the egyptian had aspear in his hand but he went down to him with a staff and pluckedthe spear out of the egyptians hand and slew him with his own spear these things did benaiah the son of jehoiada and had the nameamong three mighty men he was more honourable than the thirty but he attained not tothe first three and david set him over his guard asahel the brother of joab was one of the thirty elhanan theson of dodo of bethlehem  shammah the harodite elika theharodite  helez the paltite ira the son of ikkesh the tekoite abiezer the anethothite mebunnai the hushathite  zalmonthe ahohite maharai the netophathite  heleb the son of baanaha netophathite ittai the son of

seven in all and again the anger of the lord was kindled against israel andhe moved david against them to say go number israel and judah for the king said to joab the captain of the host which was withhim go now through all the tribes of israel from dan even tobeersheba and number ye the people that i may know the number of thepeople and joab said unto the king now the lord thy god add unto thepeople how many soever they be an hundredfold and that the eyes ofmy lord the king may see it but why doth my lord the king delight inthis thing   notwithstanding the kings word prevailed againstjoab and against the captains of the host and joab and the captainsof the host went out from the presence of the king to number thepeople of israel and they passed over jordan and pitched in aroer on the rightside of the city that lieth in the midst of the river of gad andtoward jazer  then they came to gilead and to the land oftahtimhodshi and they came to danjaan and about to zidon  andcame to the strong hold of tyre and to all the cities of the hivitesand of the canaanites and they went out to the south of judah evento beersheba so when they had gone through all the land they came tojerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days and joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto theking and there were in israel eight hundred thousand valiant men thatdrew the sword and the men of judah were five hundred thousand men and davids heart smote him after that he had numbered thepeopleand david said unto the lord i have sinned greatly in that i havedone and now i beseech thee o lord take away the iniquity of thyservant for i have done very foolishly for when david was up in the morning the word of the lord cameunto the prophet gad davids seer saying  go and say untodavid thus saith the lord i offer thee three things choose thee oneof them that i may do it unto thee so gad came to david and told him and said unto him shallseven years of famine come unto thee in thy land or wilt thou fleethree months before thine enemies while they pursue thee or thatthere be three days pestilence in thy land now advise and see whatanswer i shall return to him that sent me and david said unto gad i am in a great strait let us fall nowinto the hand of the lord for his mercies are great and let me notfall into the hand of man so the lord sent a pestilence upon israel from the morning evento the time appointed and there died of the people from dan even tobeersheba seventy thousand men and when the angel stretched out his hand upon jerusalem todestroy it the lord repented him of the evil and said to the angelthat destroyed the people it is enough stay now thine hand and theangel of the lord was by the threshingplace of araunah the jebusite and david spake unto the lord when he saw the angel that smotethe people and said lo i have sinned and i have done wickedly butthese sheep what have they done let thine hand i pray thee beagainst me and against my fathers house and gad came that day to david and said unto him go up rearan altar unto the lord in the threshingfloor of araunah the jebusite and david according to the saying of gad went up as the lordcommanded and araunah looked and saw the king and his servants coming ontoward him and araunah went out and bowed himself before the king onhis face upon the ground and araunah said wherefore is my lord the king come to hisservant  and david said to buy the threshingfloor of thee to buildan altar unto the lord that the plague may be stayed from the people and araunah said unto david let my lord the king take and offerup what seemeth good unto him behold here be oxen for burntsacrifice and threshing instruments and other instruments of the oxenfor wood all these things did araunah as a king give unto the king andaraunah said unto the king the lord thy god accept thee and the king said unto araunah nay but i will surely buy it ofthee at a price neither will i offer burnt offerings unto the lord mygod of that which doth cost me nothing so david bought thethreshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver and david built there an altar unto the lord and offered burntofferings and peace offerings so the lord was intreated for the landand the plague was stayed from israelthe first book of the kingscommonly calledthe third book of the kings now king david was old and stricken in years and they coveredhim with clothes but he gat no heat wherefore his servants said unto him let there be sought for mylord the king a young virgin and let her stand before the king andlet her cherish him and let her lie in thy bosom that my lord theking may get heat so they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts ofisrael and found abishag a shunammite and brought her to the king and the damsel was very fair and cherished the king andministered to him but the king knew her not then adonijah the son of haggith exalted himself saying i willbe king and he prepared him chariots and horsemen and fifty men torun before him and his father had not displeased him at any time in saying whyhast thou done so and he also was a very goodly man and his motherbare him after absalom and he conferred with joab the son of zeruiah and with abiatharthe priest and they following adonijah helped him but zadok the priest and benaiah the son of jehoiada and nathanthe prophet and shimei and rei and the mighty men which belonged todavid were not with adonijah and adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone ofzoheleth which is by enrogel and called all his brethren the kingssons and all the men of judah the kings servants  but nathanthe prophet and benaiah and the mighty men and solomon his brotherhe called not wherefore nathan spake unto bathsheba the mother of solomonsaying hast thou not heard that adonijah the son of haggith dothreign and david our lord knoweth it not   now therefore comelet me i pray thee give thee counsel that thou mayest save thineown life and the life of thy son solomon go and get thee in unto king david and say unto him didst notthou my lord o king swear unto thine handmaid saying assuredlysolomon thy son shall reign after me and he shall sit upon my thronewhy then doth adonijah reign   behold while thou yet talkestthere with the king i also will come in after thee and confirm thywords and bathsheba went in unto the king into the chamber and theking was very old and abishag the shunammite ministered unto theking and bathsheba bowed and did obeisance unto the king and theking said what wouldest thou   and she said unto him my lordthou swarest by the lord thy god unto thine handmaid sayingassuredly solomon thy son shall reign after me and he shall sit uponmy throne and now behold adonijah reigneth and now my lord the kingthou knowest it not  and he hath slain oxen and fat cattle andsheep in abundance and hath called all the sons of the king andabiathar the priest and joab the captain of the host but solomon thyservant hath he not called and thou my lord o king the eyes of all israel are upon theethat thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lordthe king after him otherwise it shall come to pass when my lord the king shallsleep with his fathers that i and my son solomon shall be countedoffenders and lo while she yet talked with the king nathan the prophetalso came in and they told the king saying behold nathan the prophet andwhen he was come in before the king he bowed himself before the kingwith his face to the ground and nathan said my lord o king hast thou said adonijah shallreign after me and he shall sit upon my throne   for he is gonedown this day and hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep inabundance and hath called all the kings sons and the captains ofthe host and abiathar the priest and behold they eat and drinkbefore him and say god save king adonijah but me even me thy servant and zadok the priest and benaiahthe son of jehoiada and thy servant solomon hath he not called is this thing done by my lord the king and thou hast not shewedit unto thy servant who should sit on the throne of my lord the kingafter him   then king david answered and said call me bathshebaand she came into the kings presence and stood before the king and the king sware and said as the lord liveth that hathredeemed my soul out of all distress  even as i sware unto theeby the lord god of israel saying assuredly solomon thy son shallreign after me and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead even sowill i certainly do this day then bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth and didreverence to the king and said let my lord king david live for ever and king david said call me zadok the priest and nathan theprophet and benaiah the son of jehoiada and they came before theking the king also said unto them take with you the servants of yourlord and cause solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule and bringhim down to gihon  and let zadok the priest and nathan theprophet anoint him there king over israel and blow ye with thetrumpet and say god save king solomon then ye shall come up after him that he may come and sit upon mythrone for he shall be king in my stead and i have appointed him tobe ruler over israel and over judah and benaiah the son of jehoiada answered the king and saidamen the lord god of my lord the king say so too as the lord hath been with my lord the king even so be he withsolomon and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord kingdavid so zadok the priest and nathan the prophet and benaiah the sonof jehoiada and the cherethites and the pelethites went down andcaused solomon to ride upon king davids mule and brought him togihon and zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacleand anointed solomon and they blew the trumpet and all the peoplesaid god save king solomon and all the people came up after him and the people piped withpipes and rejoiced with great joy so that the earth rent with thesound of them and adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it asthey had made an end of eating and when joab heard the sound of thetrumpet he said wherefore is this noise of the city being in anuproar   and while he yet spake behold jonathan the son ofabiathar the priest came and adonijah said unto him come in forthou art a valiant man and bringest good tidings and jonathan answered and said to adonijah verily our lord kingdavid hath made solomon king and the king hath sent with him zadok the priest and nathan theprophet and benaiah the son of jehoiada and the cherethites and thepelethites and they have caused him to ride upon the kings mule and zadok the priest and nathan the prophet have anointed himking in gihon and they are come up from thence rejoicing so that thecity rang again this is the noise that ye have heard and also solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom and moreover the kings servants came to bless our lord kingdavid saying god make the name of solomon better than thy name andmake his throne greater than thy throne and the king bowed himselfupon the bed and also thus said the king blessed be the lord god of israelwhich hath given one to sit on my throne this day mine eyes evenseeing it and all the guests that were with adonijah were afraid and roseup and went every man his way and adonijah feared because of solomon and arose and went andcaught hold on the horns of the altar and it was told solomon saying behold adonijah feareth kingsolomon for lo he hath caught hold on the horns of the altarsaying let king solomon swear unto me today that he will not slay hisservant with the sword and solomon said if he will shew himself a worthy man thereshall not an hair of him fall to the earth but if wickedness shall befound in him he shall die so king solomon sent and they brought him down from the altarand he came and bowed himself to king solomon and solomon said untohim go to thine house now the days of david drew nigh that he should die and he chargedsolomon his son saying  i go the way of all the earth be thoustrong therefore and shew thyself a man  and keep the charge ofthe lord thy god to walk in his ways to keep his statutes and hiscommandments and his judgments and his testimonies as it is writtenin the law of moses that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doestand whithersoever thou turnest thyself  that the lord may continuehis word which he spake concerning me saying if thy children takeheed to their way to walk before me in truth with all their heart andwith all their soul there shall not fail thee said he a man on thethrone of israel moreover thou knowest also what joab the son of zeruiah did to meand what he did to the two captains of the hosts of israel unto abnerthe son of ner and unto amasa the son of jether whom he slew andshed the blood of war in peace and put the blood of war upon hisgirdle that was about his loins and in his shoes that were on hisfeet do therefore according to thy wisdom and let not his hoar head godown to the grave in peace but shew kindness unto the sons of barzillai the gileadite andlet them be of those that eat at thy table for so they came to mewhen i fled because of absalom thy brother and behold thou hast with thee shimei the son of gera abenjamite of bahurim which cursed me with a grievous curse in the daywhen i went to mahanaim but he came down to meet me at jordan and isware to him by the lord saying i will not put thee to death withthe sword now therefore hold him not guiltless for thou art a wise man andknowest what thou oughtest to do unto him but his hoar head bringthou down to the grave with blood so david slept with his fathers and was buried in the city ofdavid and the days that david reigned over israel were forty yearsseven years reigned he in hebron and thirty and three years reignedhe in jerusalem then sat solomon upon the throne of david his father and hiskingdom was established greatly and adonijah the son of haggith came to bathsheba the mother ofsolomon and she said comest thou peaceably and he said peaceably he said moreover i have somewhat to say unto thee and she saidsay on and he said thou knowest that the kingdom was mine and that allisrael set their faces on me that i should reign howbeit the kingdomis turned about and is become my brothers for it was his from thelord and now i ask one petition of thee deny me not and she saidunto him say on and he said speak i pray thee unto solomon the king for hewill not say thee nay that he give me abishag the shunammite towife and bathsheba said well i will speak for thee unto the king bathsheba therefore went unto king solomon to speak unto him foradonijah and the king rose up to meet her and bowed himself untoher and sat down on his throne and caused a seat to be set for thekings mother and she sat on his right hand then she said i desire one small petition of thee i pray theesay me not nay and the king said unto her ask on my mother for iwill not say thee nay and she said let abishag the shunammite be given to adonijah thybrother to wife and king solomon answered and said unto his mother and why dostthou ask abishag the shunammite for adonijah ask for him the kingdomalso for he is mine elder brother even for him and for abiathar thepriest and for joab the son of zeruiah then king solomon sware by the lord saying god do so to me andmore also if adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life now therefore as the lord liveth which hath established me andset me on the throne of david my father and who hath made me anhouse as he promised adonijah shall be put to death this day and king solomon sent by the hand of benaiah the son of jehoiadaand he fell upon him that he died and unto abiathar the priest said the king get thee to anathothunto thine own fields for thou art worthy of death but i will not atthis time put thee to death because thou barest the ark of the lordgod before david my father and because thou hast been afflicted inall wherein my father was afflicted so solomon thrust out abiathar from being priest unto the lordthat he might fulfil the word of the lord which he spake concerningthe house of eli in shiloh then tidings came to joab for joab had turned after adonijahthough he turned not after absalom and joab fled unto the tabernacleof the lord and caught hold on the horns of the altar and it was told king solomon that joab was fled unto thetabernacle of the lord and behold he is by the altar then solomonsent benaiah the son of jehoiada saying go fall upon him and benaiah came to the tabernacle of the lord and said untohim thus saith the king come forth and he said nay but i will diehere and benaiah brought the king word again saying thus said joaband thus he answered me and the king said unto him do as he hath said and fall uponhim and bury him that thou mayest take away the innocent bloodwhich joab shed from me and from the house of my father and the lord shall return his blood upon his own head who fellupon two men more righteous and better than he and slew them with thesword my father david not knowing thereof to wit abner the son ofner captain of the host of israel and amasa the son of jethercaptain of the host of judah their blood shall therefore return upon the head of joab andupon the head of his seed for ever but upon david and upon his seedand upon his house and upon his throne shall there be peace for everfrom the lord so benaiah the son of jehoiada went up and fell upon him andslew him and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness and the king put benaiah the son of jehoiada in his room over thehost and zadok the priest did the king put in the room of abiathar and the king sent and called for shimei and said unto him buildthee an house in jerusalem and dwell there and go not forth thenceany whither for it shall be that on the day thou goest out and passest overthe brook kidron thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surelydie thy blood shall be upon thine own head and shimei said unto the king the saying is good as my lord theking hath said so will thy servant do and shimei dwelt in jerusalemmany days and it came to pass at the end of three years that two of theservants of shimei ran away unto achish son of maachah king of gathand they told shimei saying behold thy servants be in gath and shimei arose and saddled his ass and went to gath to achishto seek his servants and shimei went and brought his servants fromgath and it was told solomon that shimei had gone from jerusalem togath and was come again and the king sent and called for shimei and said unto him did inot make thee to swear by the lord and protested unto thee sayingknow for a certain on the day thou goest out and walkest abroad anywhither that thou shalt surely die and thou saidst unto me the wordthat i have heard is good why then hast thou not kept the oath of the lord and thecommandment that i have charged thee with   the king saidmoreover to shimei thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heartis privy to that thou didst to david my father therefore the lordshall return thy wickedness upon thine own head  and king solomonshall be blessed and the throne of david shall be established beforethe lord for ever so the king commanded benaiah the son of jehoiada which wentout and fell upon him that he died and the kingdom was establishedin the hand of solomon and solomon made affinity with pharaoh king of egypt and tookpharaohs daughter and brought her into the city of david until hehad made an end of building his own house and the house of the lordand the wall of jerusalem round about only the people sacrificed in high places because there was nohouse built unto the name of the lord until those days and solomon loved the lord walking in the statutes of david hisfather only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places and the king went to gibeon to sacrifice there for that was thegreat high place a thousand burnt offerings did solomon offer uponthat altar in gibeon the lord appeared to solomon in a dream by night andgod said ask what i shall give thee and solomon said thou hast shewed unto thy servant david myfather great mercy according as he walked before thee in truth andin righteousness and in uprightness of heart with thee and thou hastkept for him this great kindness that thou hast given him a son tosit on his throne as it is this day and now o lord my god thou hast made thy servant king instead ofdavid my father and i am but a little child i know not how to go outor come in and thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hastchosen a great people that cannot be numbered nor counted formultitude give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thypeople that i may discern between good and bad for who is able tojudge this thy so great a people   and the speech pleased thelord that solomon had asked this thing and god said unto him because thou hast asked this thing andhast not asked for thyself long life neither hast asked riches forthyself nor hast asked the life of thine enemies but hast asked forthyself understanding to discern judgment  behold i have doneaccording to thy words lo i have given thee a wise and anunderstanding heart so that there was none like thee before theeneither after thee shall any arise like unto thee and i have also given thee that which thou hast not asked bothriches and honour so that there shall not be any among the kingslike unto thee all thy days and if thou wilt walk in my ways to keep my statutes and mycommandments as thy father david did walk then i will lengthen thydays and solomon awoke and behold it was a dream and he came tojerusalem and stood before the ark of the covenant of the lord andoffered up burnt offerings and offered peace offerings and made afeast to all his servants then came there two women that were harlots unto the king andstood before him and the one woman said o my lord i and this woman dwell in onehouse and i was delivered of a child with her in the house and it came to pass the third day after that i was deliveredthat this woman was delivered also and we were together there was nostranger with us in the house save we two in the house and this womans child died in the night because she overlaidit and she arose at midnight and took my son from beside me whilethine handmaid slept and laid it in her bosom and laid her deadchild in my bosom and when i rose in the morning to give my child suck behold itwas dead but when i had considered it in the morning behold it wasnot my son which i did bear and the other woman said nay but the living is my son and thedead is thy son and this said no but the dead is thy son and theliving is my son thus they spake before the king then said the king the one saith this is my son that livethand thy son is the dead and the other saith nay but thy son is thedead and my son is the living and the king said bring me a sword and they brought a swordbefore the king and the king said divide the living child in two and give halfto the one and half to the other then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the kingfor her bowels yearned upon her son and she said o my lord give herthe living child and in no wise slay it but the other said let itbe neither mine nor thine but divide it then the king answered and said give her the living child andin no wise slay it she is the mother thereof and all israel heard of the judgment which the king had judgedand they feared the king for they saw that the wisdom of god was inhim to do judgment so king solomon was king over all israel and these were the princes which he had azariah the son of zadokthe priest  elihoreph and ahiah the sons of shisha scribesjehoshaphat the son of ahilud the recorder and benaiah the son of jehoiada was over the host and zadok andabiathar were the priests  and azariah the son of nathan was overthe officers and zabud

of paruah in issachar  shimeithe son of elah in benjamin  geber the son of uri was in thecountry of gilead in the country of sihon king of the amorites andof og king of bashan and he was the only officer which was in theland judah and israel were many as the sand which is by the sea inmultitude eating and drinking and making merry and solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto theland of the philistines and unto the border of egypt they broughtpresents and served solomon all the days of his life and solomons provision for one day was thirty measures of fineflour and threescore measures of meal  ten fat oxen and twentyoxen out of the pastures and an hundred sheep beside harts androebucks and fallowdeer and fatted fowl for he had dominion over all the region on this side the riverfrom tiphsah even to azzah over all the kings on this side the riverand he had peace on all sides round about him and judah and israel dwelt safely every man under his vine andunder his fig tree from dan even to beersheba all the days ofsolomon and solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariotsand twelve thousand horsemen and those officers provided victual for king solomon and for allthat came unto king solomons table every man in his month theylacked nothing barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought theyunto the place where the officers were every man according to hischarge and god gave solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much andlargeness of heart even as the sand that is on the sea shore and solomons wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children ofthe east country and all the wisdom of egypt for he was wiser than all men than ethan the ezrahite andheman and chalcol and darda the sons of mahol and his fame was inall nations round about and he spake three thousand proverbs and his songs were athousand and five and he spake of trees from the cedar tree that is in lebanoneven unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall he spake also ofbeasts and of fowl and of creeping things and of fishes and there came of all people to hear the wisdom of solomon fromall kings of the earth which had heard of his wisdom and hiram king of tyre sent his servants unto solomon for he hadheard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father forhiram was ever a lover of david and solomon sent to hiram saying  thou knowest how that davidmy father could not build an house unto the name of the lord his godfor the wars which were about him on every side until the lord putthem under the soles of his feet but now the lord my god hath given me rest on every side so thatthere is neither adversary nor evil occurrent and behold i purpose to build an house unto the name of the lordmy god as the lord spake unto david my father saying thy son whomi will set upon thy throne in thy room he shall build an house untomy name now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out oflebanon and my servants shall be with thy servants and unto theewill i give hire for thy servants according to all that thou shaltappoint for thou knowest that there is not among us any that canskill to hew timber like unto the sidonians and it came to pass when hiram heard the words of solomon thathe rejoiced greatly and said blessed be the lord this day whichhath given unto david a wise son over this great people and hiram sent to solomon saying i have considered the thingswhich thou sentest to me for and i will do all thy desire concerningtimber of cedar and concerning timber of fir my servants shall bring them down from lebanon unto the sea and iwill convey them by sea in floats unto the place that thou shaltappoint me and will cause them to be discharged there and thou shaltreceive them and thou shalt accomplish my desire in giving food formy household so hiram gave solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to allhis desire and solomon gave hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for foodto his household and twenty measures of pure oil thus gave solomonto hiram year by year and the lord gave solomon wisdom as he promised him and therewas peace between hiram and solomon and they two made a leaguetogether and king solomon raised a levy out of all israel and the levywas thirty thousand men and he sent them to lebanon ten thousand a month by courses amonth they were in lebanon and two months at home and adoniram wasover the levy and solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdensand fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains  beside the chiefof solomons officers which were over the work three thousand andthree hundred which ruled over the people that wrought in the work and the king commanded and they brought great stones costlystones and hewed stones to lay the foundation of the house and solomons builders and hirams builders did hew them and thestonesquarers so they prepared timber and stones to build the house and it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year afterthe children of israel were come out of the land of egypt in thefourth year of solomons reign over israel in the month zif which isthe second month that he began to build the house of the lord and the house which king solomon built for the lord the lengththereof was threescore cubits and the breadth thereof twenty cubitsand the height thereof thirty cubits and the porch before the temple of the house twenty cubits wasthe length thereof according to the breadth of the house and tencubits was the breadth thereof before the house and for the house he made windows of narrow lights and against the wall of the house he built chambers round aboutagainst the walls of the house round about both of the temple and ofthe oracle and he made chambers round about  the nethermostchamber was five cubits broad and the middle was six cubits broadand the third was seven cubits broad for without in the wall of thehouse he made narrowed rests round about that the beams should not befastened in the walls of the house and the house when it was in building was built of stone madeready before it was brought thither so that there was neither hammernor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house while it was inbuilding the door for the middle chamber was in the right side of thehouse and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamberand out of the middle into the third so he built the house and finished it and covered the house withbeams and boards of cedar and then he built chambers against all the house five cubitshigh and they rested on the house with timber of cedar and the word of the lord came to solomon saying  concerningthis house which thou art in building if thou wilt walk in mystatutes and execute my judgments and keep all my commandments towalk in them then will i perform my word with thee which i spakeunto david thy father  and i will dwell among the children ofisrael and will not forsake my people israel so solomon built the house and finished it and he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedarboth the floor of the house and the walls of the ceiling and hecovered them on the inside with wood and covered the floor of thehouse with planks of fir and he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house both thefloor and the walls with boards of cedar he even built them for itwithin even for the oracle even for the most holy place and the house that is the temple before it was forty cubitslong and the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and openflowers all was cedar there was no stone seen and the oracle he prepared in the house within to set there theark of the covenant of the lord and the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length andtwenty cubits in breadth and twenty cubits in the height thereof andhe overlaid it with pure gold and so covered the altar which was ofcedar so solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold and he madea partition by the chains of gold before the oracle and he overlaidit with gold and the whole house he overlaid with gold until he had finishedall the house also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaidwith gold and within the oracle he made two cherubims of olive tree eachten cubits high and five cubits was the one wing of the cherub and five cubitsthe other wing of the cherub from the uttermost part of the one wingunto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits and the other cherub was ten cubits both the cherubims were ofone measure and one size the height of the one cherub was ten cubits and so was it of theother cherub and he set the cherubims within the inner house and theystretched forth the wings of the cherubims so that the wing of theone touched the one wall and the wing of the other cherub touched theother wall and their wings touched one another in the midst of thehouse and he overlaid the cherubims with gold and he carved all the walls of the house round about with carvedfigures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers within andwithout and the floors of the house he overlaid with gold within andwithout and for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive treethe lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall the two doors also were of olive tree and he carved upon themcarvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers and overlaidthem with gold and spread gold upon the cherubims and upon the palmtrees so also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive tree afourth part of the wall and the two doors were of fir tree the two leaves of the onedoor were folding and the two leaves of the other door were folding and he carved thereon cherubims and palm trees and open flowersand covered them with gold fitted upon the carved work and he built the inner court with three rows of

house finished throughout allthe parts thereof and according to all the fashion of it so was heseven years in building it but solomon was building his own house thirteen years and hefinished all his house he built also the house of the forest of lebanon the lengththereof was an hundred cubits and the breadth thereof fifty cubitsand the height thereof thirty cubits upon four rows of cedar

thereof thirty cubits and the porch wasbefore them and the other pillars and the thick beam were beforethem then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge even theporch of judgment and it was covered with cedar from one side of thefloor to the other and his house where he dwelt had another court within the porchwhich was of the like work solomon made also an house for pharaohsdaughter whom he had taken to wife like unto this porch all these were of costly stones according to the measures ofhewed stones sawed with saws within and without even from thefoundation unto the coping and

hewed stonesand cedars and the great court round about was with three rows of hewedstones and a row of cedar beams both for the inner court of thehouse of the lord and for the porch of the house and king solomon sent and fetched hiram out of tyre he was a widows son of the tribe of naphtali and his father wasa man of tyre a worker in brass and he was filled with wisdom andunderstanding and cunning to work all works in brass and he came toking solomon and wrought all his work for he cast two pillars of brass of eighteen cubits high apieceand a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them about and he made two chapiters of molten brass to set upon the topsof the pillars the height of the one chapiter was five cubits andthe height of the other chapiter was five cubits  and nets ofchecker work and wreaths of chain work for the chapiters which wereupon the top of the pillars seven for the one chapiter and seven forthe other chapiter and he made the pillars and two rows round about upon the onenetwork to cover the chapiters that were upon the top withpomegranates and so did he for the other chapiter and the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars were oflily work in the porch four cubits and the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates alsoabove over against the belly which was by the network and thepomegranates were two hundred in rows round about upon the otherchapiter and he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple and he setup the right pillar and called the name thereof jachin and he set upthe left pillar and called the name thereof boaz and upon the top of the pillars was lily work so was the work ofthe pillars finished and he made a molten sea ten cubits from the one brim to theother it was round all about and his height was five cubits and aline of thirty cubits did compass it round about and under the brim of it round about there were knops compassingit ten in a cubit compassing the sea round about the knops werecast in two rows when it was cast it stood upon twelve oxen three looking toward the north andthree looking toward the west and three looking toward the south andthree looking toward the east and the sea was set above upon themand all their hinder parts were inward and it was an hand breadth thick and the brim thereof waswrought like the brim of a cup with flowers of lilies it containedtwo thousand baths and he made ten bases of brass four cubits was the length of onebase and four cubits the breadth thereof and three cubits the heightof it and the work of the bases was on this manner they had bordersand the borders were between the ledges  and on the borders thatwere between the ledges were lions oxen and cherubims and upon theledges there was a base above and beneath the lions and oxen werecertain additions made of thin work and every base had four brasen wheels and plates of brass andthe four corners thereof had undersetters under the laver wereundersetters molten at the side of every addition and the mouth of it within the chapiter and above was a cubitbut the mouth thereof was round after the work of the base a cubitand an half and also upon the mouth of it were gravings with theirborders foursquare not round and under the borders were four wheels and the axletrees of thewheels were joined to the base and the height of a wheel was a cubitand half a cubit and the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheeltheir axletrees and their naves and their felloes and their spokeswere all molten and there were four undersetters to the four corners of one baseand the undersetters were of the very base itself and in the top of the base was there a round compass of half acubit high and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and theborders thereof were of the same for on the plates of the ledges thereof and on the bordersthereof he graved cherubims lions and palm trees according to theproportion of every one and additions round about after this manner he made the ten bases all of them had onecasting one measure and one size then made he ten lavers of brass one laver contained fortybaths and every laver was four cubits and upon every one of the tenbases one laver and he put five bases on the right side of the house and five onthe left side of the house and he set the sea on the right side ofthe house eastward over against the south and hiram made the lavers and the shovels and the basons sohiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king solomon forthe house of the lord  the two pillars and the two bowls of thechapiters that were on the top of the two pillars and the twonetworks to cover the two bowls of the chapiters which were upon thetop of the pillars  and four hundred pomegranates for the twonetworks even two rows of pomegranates for one network to cover thetwo bowls of the chapiters that were upon the pillars  and theten bases and ten lavers on the bases  and one sea and twelveoxen under the sea  and the pots and the shovels and thebasons and all these vessels which hiram made to king solomon forthe house of the lord were of bright brass in the plain of jordan did the king cast them in the clay groundbetween succoth and zarthan and solomon left all the vessels unweighed because they wereexceeding many neither was the weight of the brass found out and solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house ofthe lord the altar of gold and the table of gold whereupon theshewbread was  and the candlesticks of pure gold five on theright side and five on the left before the oracle with the flowersand the lamps and the tongs of gold  and the bowls and thesnuffers and the basons and the spoons and the censers of puregold and the hinges of gold both for the doors of the inner housethe most holy place and for the doors of the house to wit of thetemple so was ended all the work that king solomon made for the house ofthe lord and solomon brought in the things which david his father haddedicated even the silver and the gold and the vessels did he putamong the treasures of the house of the lord then solomon assembled the elders of israel and all the heads ofthe tribes the chief of the fathers of the children of israel untoking solomon in jerusalem that they might bring up the ark of thecovenant of the lord out of the city of david which is zion and all the men of israel assembled themselves unto king solomonat the feast in the month ethanim which is the seventh month and all the elders of israel came and the priests took up theark and they brought up the ark of the lord and the tabernacle of thecongregation and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacleeven those did the priests and the levites bring up and king solomon and all the congregation of israel that wereassembled unto him were with him before the ark sacrificing sheepand oxen that could not be told nor numbered for multitude and the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the lordunto his place into the oracle of the house to the most holy placeeven under the wings of the cherubims for the cherubims spread forth their two wings over the place ofthe ark and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereofabove and they drew out the staves that the ends of the staves wereseen out in the holy place before the oracle and they were not seenwithout and there they are unto this day there was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone whichmoses put there at horeb when the lord made a covenant with thechildren of israel when they came out of the land of egypt and it came to pass when the priests were come out of the holyplace that the cloud filled the house of the lord  so that thepriests could not stand to minister because of the cloud for theglory of the lord had filled the house of the lord then spake solomon the lord said that he would dwell in thethick darkness i have surely built thee an house to dwell in a settled placefor thee to abide in for ever and the king turned his face about and blessed all thecongregation of israel and all the congregation of israel stood and he said blessed be the lord god of israel which spake withhis mouth unto david my father and hath with his hand fulfilled itsaying  since the day that i brought forth my people israel outof egypt i chose no city out of all the tribes of israel to build anhouse that my name might be therein but i chose david to be over mypeople israel and it was in the heart of david my father to build an house forthe name of the lord god of israel and the lord said unto david my father whereas it was in thineheart to build an house unto my name thou didst well that it was inthine heart nevertheless thou shalt not build the house but thy son thatshall come forth out of thy loins he shall build the house unto myname and the lord hath performed his word that he spake and i amrisen up in the room of david my father and sit on the throne ofisrael as the lord promised and have built an house for the name ofthe lord god of israel and i have set there a place for the ark wherein is the covenantof the lord which he made with our fathers when he brought them outof the land of egypt and solomon stood before the altar of the lord in the presence ofall the congregation of israel and spread forth his hands towardheaven  and he said lord god of israel there is no god likethee in heaven above or on earth beneath who keepest covenant andmercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their heart who hast kept with thy servant david my father that thoupromisedst him thou spakest also with thy mouth and hast fulfilledit with thine hand as it is this day therefore now lord god of israel keep with thy servant david myfather that thou promisedst him saying there shall not fail thee aman in my sight to sit on the throne of israel so that thy childrentake heed to their way that they walk before me as thou hast walkedbefore me and now o god of israel let thy word i pray thee be verifiedwhich thou spakest unto thy servant david my father but will god indeed dwell on the earth behold the heaven andheaven of heavens cannot contain thee how much less this house that ihave builded   yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thyservant and to his supplication o lord my god to hearken unto thecry and to the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee to day that thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day eventoward the place of which thou hast said my name shall be there thatthou mayest hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall maketoward this place and hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant and of thypeople israel when they shall pray toward this place and hear thouin heaven thy dwelling place and when thou hearest forgive if any man trespass against his

whatsoever plague whatsoeversickness there be  what prayer and supplication soever be made byany man or by all thy people israel which shall know every man theplague of his own heart and spread forth his hands toward this house then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place and forgive and doand give to every man according to his ways whose heart thou knowestfor thou even thou only knowest the hearts of all the children ofmen  that they may fear thee all the days that they live in theland which thou gavest unto our fathers moreover concerning a stranger that is not of thy people israelbut cometh out of a far country for thy names sake  for theyshall hear of thy great name and of thy strong hand and of thystretched out arm when he shall come and pray toward this house hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place and do according to allthat the stranger calleth to thee for that all people of the earthmay know thy name to fear thee as do thy people israel and thatthey may know that this house

toward the house that i have built for thyname  then hear thou in heaven their prayer and theirsupplication and maintain their cause if they sin against thee for there is no man that sinneth notand thou be angry with them and deliver them to the enemy so thatthey carry them away captives unto the land of the enemy far or near yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither theywere carried captives and repent and make supplication unto thee inthe land of them that carried them captives saying we have sinnedand have done perversely we have committed wickedness  and soreturn unto thee with all their heart and with all their soul in theland of their enemies which led them away captive and pray unto theetoward their land which thou gavest unto their fathers the citywhich thou

be thy people and thine inheritance which thoubroughtest forth out of egypt from the midst of the furnace of iron that thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servantand unto the supplication of thy people israel to hearken unto themin all that they call for unto thee for thou didst separate them from among all the people of theearth to be thine inheritance as thou spakest by the hand of mosesthy servant when thou broughtest our fathers out of egypt o lordgod and it was so that when solomon had made an end of praying allthis prayer and supplication unto the lord he arose from before thealtar of the lord from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread upto heaven and he stood and blessed all the congregation of israel with aloud voice saying  blessed be the lord that hath given restunto his people israel according to all that he promised there hathnot failed one word of all his good promise which he promised by thehand of moses his servant the lord our god be with us as he was with our fathers let himnot leave us nor forsake us  that he may incline our hearts untohim to walk in all his ways and to keep his commandments and hisstatutes and his judgments which he commanded our fathers and let these my words wherewith i have made supplication beforethe lord be nigh unto the lord our god day and night that hemaintain the cause of his servant and the cause of his people israelat all times as the matter shall require  that all the people ofthe earth may know that the lord is god and that there is none else let your heart therefore be perfect with the lord our god towalk in his statutes and to keep his commandments as at this day and the king and all israel with him offered sacrifice beforethe lord and solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings which heoffered unto the lord two and twenty thousand oxen and an hundredand twenty thousand sheep so the king and all the children of israeldedicated the house of the lord the same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that wasbefore the house of the lord for there he offered burnt offeringsand meat offerings and the fat of the peace offerings because thebrasen altar that was before the lord was too little to receive theburnt offerings and meat offerings and the fat of the peaceofferings and at that time solomon held a feast and all israel with him agreat congregation from the entering in of hamath unto the river ofegypt before the lord our god seven days and seven days evenfourteen days on the eighth day he sent the people away and they blessed theking and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all thegoodness that the lord had done for david his servant and for israelhis people and it came to pass when solomon had finished the building of thehouse of the lord and the kings house and all solomons desirewhich he was pleased to do  that the lord appeared to solomon thesecond time as he had appeared unto him at gibeon and the lord said unto him i have heard thy prayer and thysupplication that thou hast made before me i have hallowed thishouse which thou hast built to put my name there for ever and mineeyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually and if thou wilt walk before me as david thy father walked inintegrity of heart and in uprightness to do according to all that ihave commanded thee and wilt keep my statutes and my judgments then i will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon israel for everas i promised to david thy father saying there shall not fail thee aman upon the throne of israel but if ye shall at all turn from following me ye or yourchildren and will not keep my commandments and my statutes which ihave set before you but go and serve other gods and worship them then will i cut off israel out of the land which i have giventhem and this house which i have hallowed for my name will i castout of my sight and israel shall be a proverb and a byword among allpeople  and at this house which is high every one that passethby it shall be astonished and shall hiss and they shall say whyhath the lord done thus unto this land and to this house   andthey shall answer because they forsook the lord their god whobrought forth their fathers out of the land of egypt and have takenhold upon other gods and have worshipped them and served themtherefore hath the lord brought upon them all this evil and it came to pass at the end of twenty years when solomon hadbuilt the two houses the house of the lord and the kings house now hiram the king of tyre had furnished solomon with cedartrees and fir trees and with gold according to all his desire thatthen king solomon gave hiram twenty cities in the land of galilee and hiram came out from tyre to see the cities which solomon hadgiven him and they pleased him not and he said what cities are these which thou hast given me mybrother and he called them the land of cabul unto this day and hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold and this is the reason of the levy which king solomon raised forto build the house of the lord and his own house and millo and thewall of jerusalem and hazor and megiddo and gezer for pharaoh king of egypt had gone up and taken gezer and burntit with fire and slain the canaanites that dwelt in the city andgiven it for a present unto his daughter solomons wife and solomon built gezer and bethhoron the nether  andbaalath and tadmor in the wilderness in the land  and all thecities of store that solomon had and cities for his chariots andcities for his horsemen and that which solomon desired to build injerusalem and in lebanon and in all the land of his dominion and all the people that were left of the amorites hittitesperizzites hivites and jebusites which were not of the children ofisrael  their children that were left after them in the landwhom the children of israel also were not able utterly to destroyupon those did solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day but of the children of israel did solomon make no bondmen butthey were men of war and his servants and his princes and hiscaptains and rulers of his chariots and his horsemen these were the chief of the officers that were over solomonswork five hundred and fifty which bare rule over the people thatwrought in the work but pharaohs daughter came up out of the city of david unto herhouse which solomon had built for her then did he build millo and three times in a year did solomon offer burnt offerings andpeace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the lord and heburnt incense upon the altar that was before the lord so he finishedthe house and king solomon made a navy of ships in eziongeber which isbeside eloth on the shore of the red sea in the land of edom and hiram sent in the navy his servants shipmen that hadknowledge of the sea with the servants of solomon and they came to ophir and fetched from thence gold fourhundred and twenty talents and brought it to king solomon and when the queen of sheba heard of the fame of solomonconcerning the name of the lord she came to prove him with hardquestions and she came to jerusalem with a very great train with camelsthat bare spices and very much gold and precious stones and whenshe was come to solomon she communed with him of all that was in herheart and solomon told her all her questions there was not any thinghid from the king which he told her not and when the queen of sheba had seen all solomons wisdom andthe house that he had built  and the meat of his table and thesitting of his servants and the attendance of his ministers andtheir apparel and his cupbearers and his ascent by which he went upunto the house of the lord there was no more spirit in her and she said to the king it was a true report that i heard inmine own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom howbeit i believed not the words until i came and mine eyes hadseen it and behold the half was not told me thy wisdom andprosperity exceedeth the fame which i heard happy are thy men happy are these thy servants which standcontinually before thee and that hear thy wisdom blessed be the lord thy god which delighted in thee to set theeon the throne of israel because the lord loved israel for evertherefore made he thee king to do judgment and justice and she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold andof spices very great store and precious stones there came no moresuch abundance of spices as these which the queen of sheba gave toking solomon and the navy also of hiram that brought gold from ophirbrought in from ophir great plenty of almug trees and preciousstones and the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house ofthe lord and for the kings house harps also and psalteries forsingers there came no such almug trees nor were seen unto this day and king solomon gave unto the queen of sheba all her desirewhatsoever she asked beside that which solomon gave her of his royalbountyso she turned and went to her own country she and her servants now the weight of gold that came to solomon in one year was sixhundred threescore and six talents of gold  beside that he hadof the merchantmen and of the traffick of the spice merchants and ofall the kings of arabia and of the governors of the country and king solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold sixhundred shekels of gold went to one target and he made three hundred shields of beaten gold three pound ofgold went to one shield and the king put them in the house of theforest of lebanon moreover the king made a great throne of ivory and overlaid itwith the best gold the throne had six steps and the top of the throne was roundbehind and there were stays on either side on the place of the seatand two lions stood beside the stays and twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the otherupon the six steps there was not the like made in any kingdom and all king solomons drinking vessels were of gold and allthe vessels of the house of the forest of lebanon were of pure goldnone were of silver it was nothing accounted of in the days ofsolomon for the king had at sea a navy of tharshish with the navy ofhiram once in three years came the navy of tharshish bringing goldand silver ivory and apes and peacocks so king solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for richesand for wisdom and all the earth sought to solomon to hear his wisdom whichgod had put in his heart and they brought every man his present vessels of silver andvessels of gold and garments and armour and spices horses andmules a rate year by year and solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen and he hada thousand and four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemenwhom he bestowed in the cities for chariots and with the king atjerusalem and the king made silver to be in jerusalem as stones andcedars made he to be as the sycomore trees that are in the vale forabundance and solomon had horses brought out of egypt and linen yarn thekings merchants received the linen yarn at a price and a chariot came up and went out of egypt for six hundredshekels of silver and an horse for an hundred and fifty and so forall the kings of the hittites and for the kings of syria did theybring them out by their means but king solomon loved many strange women together with thedaughter of pharaoh women of the moabites ammonites edomiteszidonians and hittites  of the nations concerning which the lordsaid unto the children of israel ye shall not go in to them neithershall they come in unto you for surely they will turn away your heartafter their gods solomon clave unto these in love and he had seven hundred wives princesses and three hundredconcubines and his wives turned away his heart for it came to pass when solomon was old that his wives turnedaway his heart after other gods and his heart was not perfect withthe lord his god as was the heart of david his father for solomon went after ashtoreth the goddess of the zidoniansand after milcom the abomination of the ammonites and solomon did evil in the sight of the lord and went not fullyafter the lord as did david his father then did solomon build an high place for chemosh the abominationof moab in the hill that is before jerusalem and for molech theabomination of the children of ammon and likewise did he for all his strange wives which burntincense and sacrificed unto their gods and the lord was angry with solomon because his heart was turnedfrom the lord god of israel which had appeared unto him twice and had commanded him concerning this thing that he should not goafter other gods but he kept not that which the lord commanded wherefore the lord said unto solomon forasmuch as this is doneof thee and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes which ihave commanded thee i will surely rend the kingdom from thee andwill give it to thy servant notwithstanding in thy days i will not do it for david thyfathers sake but i will rend it out of the hand of thy son howbeit i will not rend away all the kingdom but will give onetribe to thy son for david my servants sake and for jerusalems sakewhich i have chosen and the lord stirred up an adversary unto solomon hadad theedomite he was of the kings seed in edom for it came to pass when david was in edom and joab thecaptain of the host was gone up to bury the slain after he hadsmitten every male in edom  for six months did joab remainthere with all israel until he had cut off every male in edom that hadad fled he and certain edomites of his fathers servants withhim to go into egypt hadad being yet a little child and they arose out of midian and came to paran and they tookmen with them out of paran and they came to egypt unto pharaoh kingof egypt which gave him an house and appointed him victuals andgave him land and hadad found great favour in the sight of pharaoh so that hegave him to wife the sister of his own wife the sister of tahpenesthe queen and the sister of tahpenes bare him genubath his son whomtahpenes weaned in pharaohs house and genubath was in pharaohshousehold among the sons of pharaoh and when hadad heard in egypt that david slept with his fathersand that joab the captain of the host was dead hadad said to pharaohlet me depart that i may go to mine own country then pharaoh said unto him but what hast thou lacked with methat behold thou seekest to go to thine own country and heanswered nothing howbeit let me go in any wise and god stirred him up another adversary rezon the son ofeliadah which fled from his lord hadadezer king of zobah  andhe gathered men unto him and became captain over a band when davidslew them of zobah and they went to damascus and dwelt therein andreigned in damascus and he was an adversary to israel all the days of solomonbeside the mischief that hadad did and he abhorred israel andreigned over syria and jeroboam the son of nebat an ephrathite of zeredasolomons servant whose mothers name was zeruah a widow woman evenhe lifted up his hand against the king and this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against theking solomon built millo and repaired the breaches of the city ofdavid his father and the man jeroboam was a mighty man of valour and solomonseeing the young man that he was industrious he made him ruler overall the charge of the house of joseph and it came to pass at that time when jeroboam went out ofjerusalem that the prophet ahijah the shilonite found him in the wayand he had clad himself with a new garment and they two were alone inthe field  and ahijah caught the new garment that was on himand rent it in twelve pieces  and he said to jeroboam take theeten pieces for thus saith the lord the god of israel behold i willrend the kingdom out of the hand of solomon and will give ten tribesto thee  but he shall have one tribe for my servant davidssake and for jerusalems sake the city which i have chosen out ofall the tribes of israel  because that they have forsaken meand have worshipped ashtoreth the goddess of the zidonians chemoshthe god of the moabites and milcom the god of the children of ammonand have not walked in my ways to do that which is right in mineeyes and to keep my statutes and my judgments as did david hisfather howbeit i will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand but iwill make him prince all the days of his life for david my servantssake whom i chose because he kept my commandments and my statutes but i will take the kingdom out of his sons hand and will giveit unto thee even ten tribes and unto his son will i give one tribe that david my servantmay have a light alway before me in jerusalem the city which i havechosen me to put my name there and i will take thee and thou shalt reign according to all thatthy soul desireth and shalt be king over israel and it shall be if thou wilt hearken unto all that i commandthee and wilt walk in my ways and do that is right in my sight tokeep my statutes and my commandments as david my servant did that iwill be with thee and build thee a sure house as i built for davidand will give israel unto thee and i will for this afflict the seed of david but not for ever solomon sought therefore to kill jeroboam and jeroboam aroseand fled into egypt unto shishak king of egypt and was in egyptuntil the death of solomon and the rest of the acts of solomon and all that he did andhis wisdom are they not written in the book of the acts of solomon and the time that solomon reigned in jerusalem over all israelwas forty years and solomon slept with his fathers and was buried in the cityof david his father and rehoboam his son reigned in his stead and rehoboam went to shechem for all israel were come to shechemto make him king and it came to pass when jeroboam the son of nebat who was yetin egypt heard of it for he was fled from the presence of kingsolomon and jeroboam dwelt in egypt  that they sent and calledhim and jeroboam and all the congregation of israel came and spakeunto rehoboam saying  thy father made our yoke grievous nowtherefore make thou the grievous service of thy father and his heavyyoke which he put upon us lighter and we will serve thee and he said unto them depart yet for three days then come againto me and the people departed and king rehoboam consulted with the old men that stood beforesolomon his father while he yet lived and said how do ye advise thati may answer this people   and they spake unto him saying ifthou wilt be a servant unto this people this day and wilt serve themand answer them and speak good words to them then they will be thyservants for ever but he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had givenhim and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him andwhich stood before him  and he said unto them what counsel giveye that we may answer this people who have spoken to me saying makethe yoke which thy father did put upon us lighter   and theyoung men that were grown up with him spake unto him saying thusshalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto thee saying thyfather made our yoke heavy but make thou it lighter unto us thusshalt thou say unto them my little finger shall be thicker than myfathers loins and now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke i willadd to your yoke my father hath chastised you with whips but i willchastise you with scorpions so jeroboam and all the people came to rehoboam the third dayas the king had appointed saying come to me again the third day and the king answered the people roughly and forsook the oldmens counsel that they gave him  and spake to them after thecounsel of the young men saying my father made your yoke heavy andi will add to your yoke my father also chastised you with whips buti will chastise you with scorpions wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people for the causewas from the lord that he might perform his saying which the lordspake by ahijah the shilonite unto jeroboam the son of nebat so when all israel saw that the king hearkened not unto themthe people answered the king saying what portion have we in davidneither have we inheritance in the son of jesse to your tents oisrael now see to thine own house david so israel departed untotheir tents but as for the children of israel which dwelt in the cities ofjudah rehoboam reigned over them then king rehoboam sent adoram who was over the tribute andall israel stoned him with stones that he died therefore kingrehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot to flee tojerusalem so israel rebelled against the house of david unto this day and it came to pass when all israel heard that jeroboam wascome again that they sent and called him unto the congregation andmade him king over all israel there was none that followed the houseof david but the tribe of judah only and when rehoboam was come to jerusalem he assembled all thehouse of judah with the tribe of benjamin an hundred and fourscorethousand chosen men which were warriors to fight against the houseof israel to bring the kingdom again to rehoboam the son of solomon but the word of god came unto shemaiah the man of god saying speak unto rehoboam the son of solomon king of judah and untoall the house of judah and benjamin and to the remnant of the peoplesaying  thus saith the lord ye shall not go up nor fightagainst your brethren the children of israel return every man to hishouse for this thing is from me they hearkened therefore to the wordof the lord and returned to depart according to the word of thelord then jeroboam built shechem in mount ephraim and dwelt thereinand went out from thence and built penuel and jeroboam said in his heart now shall the kingdom return tothe house of david  if this people go up to do sacrifice in thehouse of the lord at jerusalem then shall the heart of this peopleturn again unto their lord even unto rehoboam king of judah and theyshall kill me and go again to rehoboam king of judah whereupon the king took counsel and made two calves of goldand said unto them it is too much for you to go up to jerusalembehold thy gods o israel which brought thee up out of the land ofegypt and he set the one in bethel and the other put he in dan and this thing became a sin for the people went to worshipbefore the one even unto dan and he made an house of high places and made priests of thelowest of the people which were not of the sons of levi and jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month on thefifteenth day of the month like unto the feast that is in judah andhe offered upon the altar so did he in bethel sacrificing unto thecalves that he had made and he placed in bethel the priests of thehigh places which he had made so he offered upon the altar which he had made in bethel thefifteenth day of the eighth month even in the month which he haddevised of his own heart and ordained a feast unto the children ofisrael and he offered upon the altar and burnt incense and behold there came a man of god out of judah by the word ofthe lord unto bethel and jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense and he cried against the altar in the word of the lord and saido altar altar thus saith the lord behold a child shall be bornunto the house of david josiah by name and upon thee shall he offerthe priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee and mensbones shall be burnt upon thee and he gave a sign the same day saying this is the sign whichthe lord hath spoken behold the altar shall be rent and the ashesthat are upon it shall be poured out and it came to pass when king jeroboam heard the saying of theman of god which had cried against the altar in bethel that he putforth his hand from the altar saying lay hold on him and his handwhich he put forth against him dried up so that he could not pull itin again to him the altar also was rent and the ashes poured out from the altaraccording to the sign which the man of god had given by the word ofthe lord and the king answered and said unto the man of god intreat nowthe face of the lord thy god and pray for me that my hand may berestored me again and the man of god besought the lord and thekings hand was restored him again and became as it was before and the king said unto the man of god come home with me andrefresh thyself and i will give thee a reward and the man of god said unto the king if thou wilt give me halfthine house i will not go in with thee neither will i eat bread nordrink water in this place  for so was it charged me by the wordof the lord saying eat no bread nor drink water nor turn again bythe same way that thou camest so he went another way and returned not by the way that he cameto bethel now there dwelt an old prophet in bethel and his sons came andtold him all the works that the man of god had done that day inbethel the words which he had spoken unto the king them they toldalso to their father and their father said unto them what way went he for his sonshad seen what way the man of god went which came from judah and he said unto his sons saddle me the ass so they saddledhim the ass and he rode thereon  and went after the man of godand found him sitting under an oak and he said unto him art thou theman of god that camest from judah and he said i am then he said unto him come home with me and eat bread and he said i may not return with thee nor go in with theeneither will i eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place for it was said to me by the word of the lord thou shalt eat nobread nor drink water there nor turn again to go by the way that thoucamest he said unto him i am a prophet also as thou art and an angelspake unto me by the word of the lord saying bring him back withthee into thine house that he may eat bread and drink water but helied unto him so he went back with him and did eat bread in his house anddrank water and it came to pass as they sat at the table that the word ofthe lord came unto the prophet that brought him back  and hecried unto the man of god that came from judah saying thus saith thelord forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the lord and hastnot kept the commandment which the lord thy god commanded thee but camest back and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place ofthe which the lord did say to thee eat no bread and drink no waterthy carcase shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers and it came to pass after he had eaten bread and after he haddrunk that he saddled for him the ass to wit for the prophet whomhe had brought back and when he was gone a lion met him by the way and slew himand his carcase was cast in the way and the ass stood by it the lionalso stood by the carcase and behold men passed by and saw the carcase cast in the wayand the lion standing by the carcase and they came and told it in thecity where the old prophet dwelt and when the prophet that brought him back from the way heardthereof he said it is the man of god who was disobedient unto theword of the lord therefore the lord hath delivered him unto the lionwhich hath torn him and slain him according to the word of the lordwhich he spake unto him and he spake to his sons saying saddle me the ass and theysaddled him and he went and found his carcase cast in the way and the assand the lion standing by the carcase the lion had not eaten thecarcase nor torn the ass and the prophet took up the carcase of the man of god and laidit upon the ass and brought it back and the old prophet came to thecity to mourn and to bury him and he laid his carcase in his own grave and they mourned overhim saying alas my brother   and it came to pass after hehad buried him that he spake to his sons saying when i am deadthen bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of god is buried lay mybones beside his bones  for the saying which he cried by theword of the lord against the altar in bethel and against all thehouses of the high places which are in the cities of samaria shallsurely come to pass after this thing jeroboam returned not from his evil way butmade again of the lowest of the people priests of the high placeswhosoever would he consecrated him and he became one of the priestsof the high places and this thing became sin unto the house of jeroboam even tocut it off and to destroy it from off the face of the earth at that time abijah the son of jeroboam fell sick and jeroboam said to his wife arise i pray thee and disguisethyself that thou be not known to be the wife of jeroboam and getthee to shiloh behold there is ahijah the prophet which told methat i should be king over this people and take with thee ten loaves and cracknels and a cruse ofhoney and go to him he shall tell thee what shall become of thechild and jeroboams wife did so and arose and went to shiloh andcame to the house of ahijah but ahijah could not see for his eyeswere set by reason of his age and the lord said unto ahijah behold the wife of jeroboamcometh to ask a thing of thee for her son for he is sick thus andthus shalt thou say unto her for it shall be when she cometh inthat she shall feign herself to be another woman and it was so when ahijah heard the sound of her feet as shecame in at the door that he said come in thou wife of jeroboam whyfeignest thou thyself to be another for i am sent to thee with heavytidings go tell jeroboam thus saith the lord god of israel forasmuchas i exalted thee from among the people and made thee prince over mypeople israel  and rent the kingdom away from the house of davidand gave it thee and yet thou hast not been as my servant david whokept my commandments and who followed me with all his heart to dothat only which was right in mine eyes  but hast done evil aboveall that were before thee for thou hast gone and made thee othergods and molten images to provoke me to anger and hast cast mebehind thy back  therefore behold i will bring evil upon thehouse of jeroboam and will cut off from jeroboam him that pissethagainst the wall and him that is shut up and left in israel and willtake away the remnant of the house of jeroboam as a man taketh awaydung till it be all gone him that dieth of jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat andhim that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat for thelord hath spoken it arise thou therefore get thee to thine own house and when thyfeet enter into the city the child shall die and all israel shall mourn for him and bury him for he only ofjeroboam shall come to the grave because in him there is found somegood thing toward the lord god of israel in the house of jeroboam moreover the lord shall raise him up a king over israel whoshall cut off the house of jeroboam that day but what even now for the lord shall smite israel as a reed is shaken in thewater and he shall root up israel out of this good land which hegave to their fathers and shall scatter them beyond the riverbecause they have made their groves provoking the lord to anger and he shall give israel up because of the sins of jeroboam whodid sin and who made israel to sin and jeroboams wife arose and departed and came to tirzah andwhen she came to the threshold of the door the child died  andthey buried him and all israel mourned for him according to the wordof the lord which he spake by the hand of his servant ahijah theprophet and the rest of the acts of jeroboam how he warred and how hereigned behold they are written in the book of the chronicles of thekings of israel and the days which jeroboam reigned were two and twenty yearsand he slept with his fathers and nadab his son reigned in his stead and rehoboam the son of solomon reigned in judah rehoboam wasforty and one years old when

and groves onevery high hill and under every green tree and there were also sodomites in the land and they didaccording to all the abominations of the nations which the lord castout before the children of israel and it came to pass in the fifth year of king rehoboam thatshishak king of egypt came up against jerusalem  and he tookaway the treasures of the house of the lord and the treasures of thekings house he even took away all and he took away all the shieldsof gold which solomon had made and king rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields andcommitted them unto the hands of the chief of the guard which keptthe door of the kings house and it was so when the king went into the house of the lordthat the guard bare them and brought them back into the guardchamber now the rest of

of asa king of judah and reigned in his stead and it came to pass when he began to reign as soon as he saton his throne that he slew all the house of baasha he left him notone that pisseth against a wall neither of his kinsfolks nor of hisfriends thus did zimri destroy all the house of baasha according to theword of the lord which he spake against baasha by jehu the prophet for all the sins of

into the palace of the kings house and burnt the kingshouse over him with fire and died for his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of thelord in walking in the way of jeroboam and in his sin which he didto make israel to sin now the rest of the acts of zimri and his treason that hewrought are they not written in the book of the chronicles of thekings of israel   then were the people of israel divided intotwo parts half of the people followed tibni the son of ginath tomake him king and half followed omri but the people that followed omri prevailed against the peoplethat followed

bethelite build jericho he laid thefoundation thereof in abiram his firstborn and set up the gatesthereof in his youngest son segub according to the word of the lordwhich he spake by joshua the son of nun and elijah the tishbite who was of the inhabitants of gileadsaid unto ahab as the lord god of israel liveth before whom i standthere shall not be dew nor rain these years but according to my word and the word of the lord came unto him saying  get theehence and turn thee eastward and hide thyself by the brook cheriththat is before jordan and it shall be that thou shalt drink of the brook and i havecommanded the ravens to feed thee there so he went and did according unto the word of the lord for hewent and dwelt by the brook cherith that is before jordan and the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning andbread and flesh in the evening and he drank of the brook and it came to pass after a while that the brook dried upbecause there had been no rain in the land and the word of the lord came unto him saying  arise getthee to zarephath which belongeth to zidon and dwell there beholdi have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee so he arose and went to zarephath and when he came to the gateof the city behold the widow woman was there gathering of sticksand he called to her and said fetch me i pray thee a little waterin a vessel that i may drink and as she was going to fetch it he called to her and saidbring me i pray thee a morsel of bread in thine hand and she said as the lord thy god liveth i have not a cake butan handful of meal in a barrel and a little oil in a cruse andbehold i am gathering two sticks that i may go in and dress it forme and my son that we may eat it and die and elijah said unto her fear not go and do as thou hast saidbut make me thereof a little cake first and bring it unto me andafter make for thee and for thy son for thus saith the lord god of israel the barrel of meal shallnot waste neither shall the cruse of oil fail until the day that thelord sendeth rain upon the earth and she went and did according to the saying of elijah and sheand he and her house did eat many days and the barrel of meal wasted not neither did the cruse of oilfail according to the word of the lord which he spake by elijah and it came to pass after these things that the son of thewoman the mistress of the house fell sick and his sickness was sosore that there was no breath left in him and she said unto elijah what have i to do with thee o thouman of god art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance andto slay my son   and he said unto her give me thy son and hetook him out of her bosom and carried him up into a loft where heabode and laid him upon his own bed and he cried unto the lord and said o lord my god hast thoualso brought evil upon the widow with whom i sojourn by slaying herson   and he stretched himself upon the child three times andcried unto the lord and said o lord my god i pray thee let thischilds soul come into him again and the lord heard the voice of elijah and the soul of thechild came into him again and he revived and elijah took the child and brought him down out of thechamber into the house and delivered him unto his mother and elijahsaid see thy son liveth and the woman said to elijah now by this i know that thou art aman of god and that the word of the lord in thy mouth is truth and it came to pass after many days that the word of the lordcame to elijah in the third year saying go shew thyself unto ahaband i will send rain upon the earth and elijah went to shew himself unto ahab and there was a sorefamine in samaria and ahab called obadiah which was the governor of his housenow obadiah feared the lord greatly  for it was so when jezebelcut off the prophets of the lord that obadiah took an hundredprophets and hid them by fifty in a cave and fed them with bread andwater   and ahab said unto obadiah go into the land unto allfountains of water and unto all brooks peradventure we may findgrass to save the horses and mules alive that we lose not all thebeasts so they divided the land between them to pass throughout it ahabwent one way by himself and obadiah went another way by himself and as obadiah was in the way behold elijah met him and heknew him and fell on his face and said art thou that my lordelijah   and he answered him i am go tell thy lord beholdelijah is here and he said what have i sinned that thou wouldest deliver thyservant into the hand of ahab to slay me   as the lord thy godliveth there is no nation or kingdom whither my lord hath not sentto seek thee and when they said he is not there he took an oath ofthe kingdom and nation that they found thee not and now thou sayest go tell thy lord behold elijah is here and it shall come to pass as soon as i am gone from thee thatthe spirit of the lord shall carry thee whither i know not and sowhen i come and tell ahab and he cannot find thee he shall slay mebut i thy servant fear the lord from my youth was it not told my lord what i did when jezebel slew theprophets of the lord how i hid an hundred men of the lords prophetsby fifty in a cave and fed them with bread and water   and nowthou sayest go tell thy lord behold elijah is here and he shallslay me and elijah said as the lord of hosts liveth before whom istand i will surely shew myself unto him to day so obadiah went to meet ahab and told him and ahab went tomeet elijah and it came to pass when ahab saw elijah that ahab said untohim art thou he that troubleth israel   and he answered i havenot troubled israel but thou and thy fathers house in that ye haveforsaken the commandments of the lord and thou hast followed baalim now therefore send and gather to me all israel unto mountcarmel and the prophets of baal four hundred and fifty and theprophets of the groves four hundred which eat at jezebels table so ahab sent unto all the children of israel and gathered theprophets together unto mount carmel and elijah came unto all the people and said how long halt yebetween two opinions if the lord be god follow him but if baalthen follow him and the people answered him not a word then said elijah unto the people i even i only remain aprophet of the lord but baals prophets are four hundred and fiftymen let them therefore give us two bullocks and let them choose onebullock for themselves and cut it in pieces and lay it on wood andput no fire under and i will dress the other bullock and lay it onwood and put no fire under  and call ye on the name of yourgods and i will call on the name of the lord and the god thatanswereth by fire let him be god and all the people answered andsaid it is well spoken and elijah said unto the prophets of baal choose you onebullock for yourselves and dress it first for ye are many and callon the name of your gods but put no fire under and they took the bullock which was given them and they dressedit and called on the name of baal from morning even until noonsaying o baal hear us but there was no voice nor any thatanswered and they leaped upon the altar which was made and it came to pass at noon that elijah mocked them and saidcry aloud for he is a god either he is talking or he is pursuingor he is in a journey or peradventure he sleepeth and must beawaked and they cried aloud and cut themselves after their manner withknives and lancets till the blood gushed out upon them and it came to pass when midday was past and they prophesieduntil the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that therewas neither voice nor any to answer nor any that regarded and elijah said unto all the people come near unto me and allthe people came near unto him and he repaired the altar of the lordthat was broken down and elijah took twelve stones according to the number of thetribes of the sons of jacob unto whom the word of the lord camesaying israel shall be thy name  and with the stones he builtan altar in the name of the lord and he made a trench about thealtar as great as would contain two measures of seed and he put the wood in order and cut the bullock in pieces andlaid him on the wood and said fill four barrels with water and pourit on the burnt sacrifice and on the wood and he said do it the second time and they did it the secondtimeand he said do it the third time and they did it the third time and the water ran round about the altar and he filled thetrench also with water and it came to pass at the time of the offering of the eveningsacrifice that elijah the prophet came near and said lord god ofabraham isaac and of israel let it be known this day that thou artgod in israel and that i am thy servant and that i have done allthese things at thy word hear me o lord hear me that this people may know that thouart the lord god and that thou hast turned their heart back again then the fire of the lord fell and consumed the burntsacrifice and the wood and the stones and the dust and licked upthe water that was in the trench and when all the people saw it they fell on their faces andthey said the lord he is the god the lord he is the god and elijah said unto them take the prophets of baal let notone of them escape and they took them and elijah brought them downto the brook kishon and slew them there and elijah said unto ahab get thee up eat and drink for thereis a sound of abundance of rain so ahab went up to eat and to drink and elijah went up to thetop of carmel and he cast himself down upon the earth and put hisface between his knees  and said to his servant go up now looktoward the sea and he went up and looked and said there isnothing and he said go again seven times and it came to pass at the seventh time that he said beholdthere ariseth a little cloud out of the sea like a mans hand and hesaid go up say unto ahab prepare thy chariot and get thee downthat the rain stop thee not and it came to pass in the mean while that the heaven was blackwith clouds and wind and there was a great rain and ahab rode andwent to jezreel and the hand of the lord was on elijah and he girded up hisloins and ran before ahab to the entrance of jezreel and ahab told jezebel all that elijah had done and withal how hehad slain all the prophets with the sword then jezebel sent a messenger unto elijah saying so let thegods do to me and more also if i make not thy life as the life ofone of them by to morrow about this time and when he saw that he arose and went for his life and cameto beersheba which belongeth to judah and left his servant there but he himself went a days journey into the wilderness and cameand sat down under a juniper tree and he requested for himself thathe might die and said it is enough now o lord take away my lifefor i am not better than my fathers and as he lay and slept under a juniper tree behold then anangel touched him and said unto him arise and eat and he looked and behold there was a cake baken on the coalsand a cruse of water at his head and he did eat and drink and laidhim down again and the angel of the lord came again the second time and touchedhim and said arise and eat because the journey is too great forthee and he arose and did eat and drink and went in the strength ofthat meat forty days and forty nights unto horeb the mount of god and he came thither unto a cave and lodged there and beholdthe word of the lord came to him and he said unto him what doestthou here elijah   and he said i have been very jealous forthe lord god of hosts for the children of israel have forsaken thycovenant thrown down thine altars and slain thy prophets with thesword and i even i only am left and they seek my life to take itaway and he said go forth and stand upon the mount before the lordand behold the lord passed by and a great and strong wind rent themountains and brake in pieces the rocks before the lord but the lordwas not in the wind and after the wind an earthquake but the lordwas not in the earthquake  and after the earthquake a fire butthe lord was not in the fire and after the fire a still small voice and it was so when elijah heard it that he wrapped his face inhis mantle and went out and stood in the entering in of the caveand behold there came a voice unto him and said what doest thouhere elijah   and he said i have been very jealous for thelord god of hosts because the children of israel have forsaken thycovenant thrown down thine altars and slain thy prophets with thesword and i even i only am left and they seek my life to take itaway and the lord said unto him go return on thy way to thewilderness of damascus and when thou comest anoint hazael to be kingover syria  and jehu the son of nimshi shalt thou anoint to beking over israel and elisha the son of shaphat of abelmeholah shaltthou anoint to be prophet in thy room and it shall come to pass that him that escapeth the sword ofhazael shall jehu slay and him that escapeth from the sword of jehushall elisha slay yet i have left me seven thousand in israel all the knees whichhave not bowed unto baal and every mouth which hath not kissed him so he departed thence and found elisha the son of shaphat whowas plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him and he with thetwelfth and elijah passed by him and cast his mantle upon him and he left the oxen and ran after elijah and said let me ipray thee kiss my father and my mother and then i will follow theeand he said unto him go back again for what have i done to thee and he returned back from him and took a yoke of oxen and slewthem and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen andgave unto the people and they did eat then he arose and went afterelijah and ministered unto him and benhadad the king of syria gathered all his host togetherand there were thirty and two kings with him and horses andchariots and he went up and besieged samaria and warred against it and he sent messengers to ahab king of israel into the city andsaid unto him thus saith benhadad  thy silver and thy gold ismine thy wives also and thy children even the goodliest are mine and the king of israel answered and said my lord o kingaccording to thy saying i am thine and all that i have and the messengers came again and said thus speaketh benhadadsaying although i have sent unto thee saying thou shalt deliver methy silver and thy gold and thy wives and thy children  yet iwill send my servants unto thee to morrow about this time and theyshall search thine house and the houses of thy servants and it shallbe that whatsoever is pleasant in thine eyes they shall put it intheir hand and take it away then the king of israel called all the elders of the land andsaid mark i pray you and see how this man seeketh mischief for hesent unto me for my wives and for my children and for my silver andfor my gold and i denied him not and all the elders and all the people said unto him hearken notunto him nor consent wherefore he said unto the messengers of benhadad tell my lordthe king all that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first iwill do but this thing i may not do and the messengers departed andbrought him word again and benhadad sent unto him and said the gods do so unto meand more also if the dust of samaria shall suffice for handfuls forall the people that follow me and the king of israel answered and said tell him let not himthat girdeth on his harness boast himself as he that putteth it off and it came to pass when benhadad heard this message as hewas drinking he and the kings in the pavilions that he said unto hisservants set yourselves in array and they set themselves in arrayagainst the city and behold there came a prophet unto ahab king of israelsaying thus saith the lord hast thou seen all this great multitudebehold i will deliver it into thine hand this day and thou shaltknow that i am the lord and ahab said by whom and he said thus saith the lord evenby the young men of the princes of the provinces then he said whoshall order the battle and he answered thou then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provincesand they were two hundred and thirty two and after them he numberedall the people even all the children of israel being seven thousand and they went out at noon but benhadad was drinking himselfdrunk in the pavilions he and the kings the thirty and two kingsthat helped him and the young men of the princes of the provinces went outfirst and benhadad sent out and they told him saying there are mencome out of samaria and he said whether they be come out for peace take themalive or whether they be come out for war take them alive so these young men of the princes of the provinces came out ofthe city and the army which followed them and they slew every one his man and the syrians fled andisrael pursued them and benhadad the king of syria escaped on anhorse with the horsemen and the king of israel went out and smote the horses andchariots and slew the syrians with a great slaughter and the prophet came to the king of israel and said unto himgo strengthen thyself and mark and see what thou doest for at thereturn of the year the king of syria will come up against thee and the servants of the king of syria said unto him their godsare gods of the hills therefore they were stronger than we but letus fight against them in the plain and surely we shall be strongerthan they and do this thing take the kings away every man out of hisplace and put captains in their rooms  and number thee an armylike the army that thou hast lost horse for horse and chariot forchariot and we will fight against them in the plain and surely weshall be stronger than they and he hearkened unto their voice anddid so and it came to pass at the return of the year that benhadadnumbered the syrians and went up to aphek to fight against israel and the children of israel were numbered and were all presentand went against them and the children of israel pitched before themlike two little flocks of kids but the syrians filled the country and there came a man of god and spake unto the king of israeland said thus saith the lord because the syrians have said the lordis god of the hills but he is not god of the valleys therefore willi deliver all this great multitude into thine hand and ye shall knowthat i am the lord and they pitched one over against the other seven days and soit was that in the seventh day the battle was joined and thechildren of israel slew of the syrians an hundred thousand footmen inone day but the rest fled to aphek into the city and there a wall fellupon twenty and seven thousand of the men that were left and benhadadfled and came into the city into an inner chamber and his servants said unto him behold now we have heard thatthe kings of the house of israel are merciful kings let us i praythee put sackcloth on our loins and ropes upon our heads and go outto the king of israel peradventure he will save thy life so they girded sackcloth on their loins and put ropes on theirheads and came to the king of israel and said thy servant benhadadsaith i pray thee let me live and he said is he yet alive he ismy brother now the men did diligently observe whether any thing would comefrom him and did hastily catch it and they said thy brotherbenhadad then he said go ye bring him then benhadad came forth tohim and he caused him to come up into the chariot and benhadad said unto him the cities which my father tookfrom thy father i will restore and thou shalt make streets for theein damascus as my father made in samaria then said ahab i will sendthee away with this covenant so he made a covenant with him and senthim away and a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto hisneighbour in the word of the lord smite me i pray thee and the manrefused to smite him then said he unto him because thou hast not obeyed the voice ofthe lord behold as soon as thou art departed from me a lion shallslay theeand as soon as he was departed from him a lion found him and slewhim then he found another man and said smite me i pray thee andthe man smote him so that in smiting he wounded him so the prophet departed and waited for the king by the way anddisguised himself with ashes upon his face and as the king passed by he cried unto the king and he saidthy servant went out into the midst of the battle and behold a manturned aside and brought a man unto me and said keep this man ifby any means he be missing then shall thy life be for his life orelse thou shalt pay a talent of silver and as thy servant was busy here and there he was gone and theking of israel said unto him so shall thy judgment be thyself hastdecided it and he hasted and took the ashes away from his face and theking of israel discerned him that he was of the prophets and he said unto him thus saith the lord because thou hast letgo out of thy hand a man whom i appointed to utter destructiontherefore thy life shall go for his life and thy people for hispeople and the king of israel went to his house heavy and displeasedand came to samaria and it came to pass after these things that naboth thejezreelite had a vineyard which was in jezreel hard by the palace ofahab king of samaria and ahab spake unto naboth saying give me thy vineyard that imay have it for a garden of herbs because it is near unto my houseand i will give thee for it a better vineyard than it or if it seemgood to thee i will give thee the worth of it in money and naboth said to ahab the lord forbid it me that i shouldgive the inheritance of my fathers unto thee and ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of theword which naboth the jezreelite had spoken to him for he had said iwill not give thee the inheritance of my fathers and he laid him downupon his bed and turned away his face and would eat no bread but jezebel his wife came to him and said unto him why is thyspirit so sad that thou eatest no bread   and he said unto herbecause i spake unto naboth the jezreelite and said unto him give methy vineyard for money or else if it please thee i will give theeanother vineyard for it and he answered i will not give thee myvineyard and jezebel his wife said unto him dost thou now govern thekingdom of israel arise and eat bread and let thine heart be merryi will give thee the vineyard of naboth the jezreelite so she wrote letters in ahabs name and sealed them with hisseal and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that werein his city dwelling with naboth and she wrote in the letters saying proclaim a fast and setnaboth on high among the people  and set two men sons ofbelial before him to bear witness against him saying thou didstblaspheme god and the king and then carry him out and stone himthat he may die and the men of his city even the elders and the nobles who werethe inhabitants in his city did as jezebel had sent unto them and asit was written in the letters which she had sent unto them they proclaimed a fast and set naboth on high among the people and there came in two men children of belial and sat beforehim and the men of belial witnessed against him even against nabothin the presence of the people saying naboth did blaspheme god andthe king then they carried him forth out of the city and stoned himwith stones that he died then they sent to jezebel saying naboth is stoned and isdead and it came to pass when jezebel heard that naboth was stonedand was dead that jezebel said to ahab arise take possession of thevineyard of naboth the jezreelite which he refused to give thee formoney for naboth is not alive but dead and it came to pass when ahab heard that naboth was dead thatahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of naboth the jezreelite totake possession of it and the word of the lord came to elijah the tishbite saying arise go down to meet ahab king of israel which is in samariabehold he is in the vineyard of naboth whither he is gone down topossess it and thou shalt speak unto him saying thus saith the lord hastthou killed and also taken possession and thou shalt speak unto himsaying thus saith the lord in the place where dogs licked the bloodof naboth shall dogs lick thy blood even thine and ahab said to elijah hast thou found me o mine enemy andhe answered i have found thee because thou hast sold thyself to workevil in the sight of the lord behold i will bring evil upon thee and will take away thyposterity and will cut off from ahab him that pisseth against thewall and him that is shut up and left in israel  and will makethine house like the house of jeroboam the son of nebat and like thehouse of baasha the son of ahijah for the provocation wherewith thouhast provoked me to anger and made israel to sin and of jezebel also spake the lord saying the dogs shall eatjezebel by the wall of jezreel him that dieth of ahab in the city the dogs shall eat and himthat dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat but there was none like unto ahab which did sell himself towork wickedness in the sight of the lord whom jezebel his wifestirred up and he did very abominably in following idols according to allthings as did the amorites whom the lord cast out before the childrenof israel and it came to pass when ahab heard those words that he renthis clothes and put sackcloth upon his flesh and fasted and lay insackcloth and went softly and the word of the lord came to elijah the tishbite saying seest thou how ahab humbleth himself before me because hehumbleth himself before me i will not bring the evil in his days butin his sons days will i bring the evil upon his house and they continued three years without war between syria andisrael and it came to pass in the third year that jehoshaphat the kingof judah came down to the king of israel and the king of israel said unto his servants know ye thatramoth in gilead is ours and we be still and take it not out of thehand of the king of syria   and he said unto jehoshaphat wiltthou go with me to battle to ramothgilead and jehoshaphat said to theking of israel i am as thou art my people as thy people my horsesas thy horses and jehoshaphat said unto the king of israel enquire i praythee at the word of the lord to day then the king of israel gathered the prophets together aboutfour hundred men and said unto them shall i go against ramothgileadto battle or shall i forbear and they said go up for the lordshall deliver it into the hand of the king and jehoshaphat said is there not here a prophet of the lordbesides that we might enquire of him   and the king of israelsaid unto jehoshaphat there is yet one man micaiah the son of imlahby whom we may enquire of the lord but i hate him for he doth notprophesy good concerning me but evil and jehoshaphat said let notthe king say so then the king of israel called an officer and said hastenhither micaiah the son of imlah and the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah sateach on his throne having put on their robes in a void place in theentrance of the gate of samaria and all the prophets prophesiedbefore them and zedekiah the son of chenaanah made him horns of iron and hesaid thus saith the lord with these shalt thou push the syriansuntil thou have consumed them and all the prophets prophesied so saying go up toramothgilead and prosper for the lord shall deliver it into thekings hand and the messenger that was gone to call micaiah spake unto himsaying behold now the words of the prophets declare good unto theking with one mouth let thy word i pray thee be like the word ofone of them and speak that which is good and micaiah said as the lord liveth what the lord saith untome that will i speak so he came to the king and the king said unto him micaiahshall we go against ramothgilead to battle or shall we forbear andhe answered him go and prosper for the lord shall deliver it intothe hand of the king and the king said unto him how many times shall i adjure theethat thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of thelord   and he said i saw all israel scattered upon the hillsas sheep that have not a shepherd and the lord said these have nomaster let them return every man to his house in peace and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat did i not tellthee that he would prophesy no good concerning me but evil  and he said hear thou therefore the word of the lord i saw the lordsitting on his throne and all the host of heaven standing by him onhis right hand and on his left and the lord said who shall persuade ahab that he may go upand fall at ramothgilead and one said on this manner and anothersaid on that manner and there came forth a spirit and stood before the lord andsaid i will persuade him and the lord said unto him wherewith and he said i will goforth and i will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophetsand he said thou shalt persude him and prevail also go forth anddo so now therefore behold the lord hath put a lying spirit in themouth of all these thy prophets and the lord hath spoken evilconcerning thee but zedekiah the son of chenaanah went near and smote micaiahon the cheek and said which way went the spirit of the lord from meto speak unto thee   and micaiah said behold thou shalt see inthat day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself and the king of israel said take micaiah and carry him backunto amon the governor of the city and to joash the kings son and say thus saith the king put this fellow in the prison and feedhim with bread of affliction and with water of affliction until icome in peace and micaiah said if thou return at all in peace the lord hathnot spoken by me and he said hearken o people every one of you so the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah went upto ramothgilead and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat i will disguisemyself and enter into the battle but put thou on thy robes and theking of israel disguised himself and went into the battle but the king of syria commanded his thirty and two captains thathad rule over his chariots saying fight neither with small norgreat save only with the king of israel and it came to pass when the captains of the chariots sawjehoshaphat that they said surely it is the king of israel and theyturned aside to fight against him and jehoshaphat cried out and it came to pass when the captains of the chariots perceivedthat it was not the king of israel that they turned back frompursuing him and a certain man drew a bow at a venture and smote the king ofisrael between the joints of the harness wherefore he said unto thedriver of his chariot turn thine hand and carry me out of the hostfor i am wounded and the battle increased that day and the king was stayed up inhis chariot against the syrians and died at even and the blood ranout of the wound into the midst of the chariot and there went a proclamation throughout the host about thegoing down of the sun saying every man to his city and every man tohis own country so the king died and was brought to samaria and they buriedthe king in samaria and one washed the chariot in the pool of samaria and the dogslicked up his blood and they washed his armour according unto theword of the lord which he spake now the rest of the acts of ahab and all that he did and theivory house which he made and all the cities that he built are theynot written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel so ahab slept with his fathers and ahaziah his son reigned inhis stead and jehoshaphat the son of asa began to reign over judah in thefourth year of ahab king of israel jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began toreign and he reigned twenty and five years in jerusalem and hismothers name was azubah the daughter of shilhi and he walked in all the ways of asa his father he turned notaside from it doing that which was right in the eyes of the lordnevertheless the high places were not taken away for the peopleoffered and burnt incense yet in the high places and jehoshaphat made peace with the king of israel now the rest of the acts of jehoshaphat and his might that heshewed and how he warred are they not written in the book of thechronicles of the kings of judah   and the remnant of thesodomites which remained in the days of his father asa he took outof the land there was then no king in edom a deputy was king jehoshaphat made ships of tharshish to go to ophir for gold butthey went not for the ships were broken at eziongeber then said ahaziah the son of ahab unto jehoshaphat let myservants go with thy servants in the ships but jehoshaphat would not and jehoshaphat slept with his fathers and was buried with hisfathers in the city of david his father and jehoram his son reignedin his stead ahaziah the son of ahab began to reign over israel in samariathe seventeenth year of jehoshaphat king of judah and reigned twoyears over israel and he did evil in the sight of the lord and walked in the wayof his father and in the way of his mother and in the way ofjeroboam the son of nebat who made israel to sin  for he servedbaal and worshipped him and provoked to anger the lord god ofisrael according to all that his father had donethe second book of the kingscommonly calledthe fourth book of the kings then moab rebelled against israel after the death of ahab and ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber thatwas in samaria and was sick and he sent messengers and said untothem go enquire of baalzebub the god of ekron whether i shallrecover of this disease but the angel of the lord said to elijah the tishbite arise goup to meet the messengers of the king of samaria and say unto themis it not because there is not a god in israel that ye go to enquireof baalzebub the god of ekron   now therefore thus saith the lordthou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up butshalt surely die and elijah departed and when the messengers turned back unto him he said unto themwhy are ye now turned back   and they said unto him there came aman up to meet us and said unto us go turn again unto the king thatsent you and say unto him thus saith the lord is it not becausethere is not a god in israel that thou sendest to enquire ofbaalzebub the god of ekron therefore thou shalt not come down fromthat bed on which thou art gone up but shalt surely die and he said unto them what manner of man was he which came up tomeet you and told you these words   and they answered him he wasan hairy man and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins andhe said it is elijah the tishbite then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty andhe went up to him and behold he sat on the top of an hill and hespake unto him thou man of god the king hath said come down and elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty if i be aman of god then let fire come down from heaven and consume thee andthy fiftyand there came down fire from heaven and consumed him and his fifty again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with hisfiftyand he answered and said unto him o man of god thus hath the kingsaid come down quickly and elijah answered and said unto them if i be a man of god letfire come down from heaven and consume thee and thy fifty and thefire of god came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty and he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fiftyand the third captain of fifty went up and came and fell on his kneesbefore elijah and besought him and said unto him o man of god ipray thee let my life and the life of these fifty thy servants beprecious in thy sight behold there came fire down from heaven and burnt up the twocaptains of the former fifties with their fifties therefore let mylife now be precious in thy sight and the angel of the lord said unto elijah go down with him benot afraid of him and he arose and went down with him unto the king and he said unto him thus saith the lord forasmuch as thou hastsent messengers to enquire of baalzebub the god of ekron is it notbecause there is no god in israel to enquire of his word thereforethou shalt not come down off that bed on which thou art gone up butshalt surely die so he died according to the word of the lord which elijah hadspokenand jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of jehoram the sonof jehoshaphat king of judah because he had no son now the rest of the acts of ahaziah which he did are they notwritten in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel   andit came to pass when the lord would take up elijah into heaven by awhirlwind that elijah went with elisha from gilgal and elijah said unto elisha tarry here i pray thee for the lordhath sent me to bethel and elisha said unto him as the lord livethand as thy soul liveth i will not leave thee so they went down tobethel and the sons of the prophets that were at bethel came forth toelisha and said unto him knowest thou that the lord will take awaythy master from thy head to day and he said yea i know it hold yeyour peace and elijah said unto him elisha tarry here i pray thee for thelord hath sent me to jericho and he said as the lord liveth and asthy soul liveth i will not leave thee so they came to jericho and the sons of the prophets that were at jericho came to elishaand said unto him knowest thou that the lord will take away thymaster from thy head to day and he answered yea i know it hold yeyour peace and elijah said unto him tarry i pray thee here for the lordhath sent me to jordan and he said as the lord liveth and as thysoul liveth i will not leave thee and they two went on and fifty men of the sons of the prophets went and stood to viewafar off and they two stood by jordan and elijah took his mantle and wrapped it together and smote thewaters and they were divided hither and thither so that they twowent over on dry ground and it came to pass when they were gone over that elijah saidunto elisha ask what i shall do for thee before i be taken away fromthee and elisha said i pray thee let a double portion of thy spiritbe upon me and he said thou hast asked a hard thing nevertheless if thousee me when i am taken from thee it shall be so unto thee but ifnot it shall not be so and it came to pass as they still went on and talked thatbehold there appeared a chariot of fire and horses of fire andparted them both asunder and elijah went up by a whirlwind intoheaven and elisha saw it and he cried my father my father thechariot of israel and the horsemen thereof and he saw him no moreand he took hold of his own clothes and rent them in two pieces he took up also the mantle of elijah that fell from him and wentback and stood by the bank of jordan  and he took the mantle ofelijah that fell from him and smote the waters and said where isthe lord god of elijah and when he also had smitten the waters theyparted hither and thither and elisha went over and when the sons of the prophets which were to view at jerichosaw him they said the spirit of elijah doth rest on elisha and theycame to meet him and bowed themselves to the ground before him and they said unto him behold now there be with thy servantsfifty strong men let them go we pray thee and seek thy master lestperadventure the spirit of the lord hath taken him up and cast himupon some mountain or into some valley and he said ye shall notsend and when they urged him till he was ashamed he said send theysent therefore fifty men and they sought three days but found himnot and when they came again to him for he tarried at jericho hesaid unto them did i not say unto you go not   and the men ofthe city said unto elisha behold i pray thee the situation of thiscity is pleasant as my lord seeth but the water is naught and theground barren and he said bring me a new cruse and put salt therein and theybrought it to him and he went forth unto the spring of the waters and cast thesalt in there and said thus saith the lord i have healed thesewaters there shall not be from thence any more death or barren land so the waters were healed unto this day according to the sayingof elisha which he spake and he went up from thence unto bethel and as he was going up bythe way there came forth little children out of the city and mockedhim and said unto him go up thou bald head go up thou bald head and he turned back and looked on them and cursed them in thename of the lord and there came forth two she bears out of the woodand tare forty and two children of them and he went from thence to mount carmel and from thence hereturned to samaria now jehoram the son of ahab began to reign over israel in samariathe eighteenth year of jehoshaphat king of judah and reigned twelveyears and he wrought evil in the sight of the lord but not like hisfather and like his mother for he put away the image of baal thathis father had made nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of jeroboam the son ofnebat which made israel to sin he departed not therefrom and mesha king of moab was a sheepmaster and rendered unto theking of israel an hundred thousand lambs and an hundred thousandrams with the wool but it came to pass when ahab was dead that the king of moabrebelled against the king of israel and king jehoram went out of samaria the same time and numberedall israel and he went and sent to jehoshaphat the king of judah saying theking of moab hath rebelled against me wilt thou go with me againstmoab to battle and he said i will go up i am as thou art my peopleas thy people and my horses as thy horses and he said which way shall we go up and he answered the waythrough the wilderness of edom so the king of israel went and the king of judah and the king ofedom and they fetched a compass of seven days journey and there wasno water for the host and for the cattle that followed them and the king of israel said alas that the lord hath calledthese three kings together to deliver them into the hand of moab but jehoshaphat said is there not here a prophet of the lordthat we may enquire of the lord by him and one of the king ofisraels servants answered and said here is elisha the son ofshaphat which poured water on the hands of elijah and jehoshaphat said the word of the lord is with him so theking of israel and jehoshaphat and the king of edom went down to him and elisha said unto the king of israel what have i to do withthee  get thee to the prophets of thy father and to the prophets ofthy motherand the king of israel said unto him nay for the lord hath calledthese three kings together to deliver them into the hand of moab and elisha said as the lord of hosts liveth before whom istand surely were it not that i regard the presence of jehoshaphatthe king of judah i would not look toward thee nor see thee but now bring me a minstrel and it came to pass when theminstrel played that the hand of the lord came upon him and he said thus saith the lord make this valley full ofditches for thus saith the lord ye shall not see wind neither shall yesee rain yet that valley shall be filled with water that ye maydrink both ye and your cattle and your beasts and this is but a light thing in the sight of the lord he willdeliver the moabites also into your hand and ye shall smite every fenced city and every choice city andshall fell every good tree and stop all wells of water and mar everygood piece of land with stones and it came to pass in the morning when the meat offering wasoffered that behold there came water by the way of edom and thecountry was filled with water and when all the moabites heard that the kings were come up tofight against them they gathered all that were able to put on armourand upward and stood in the border and they rose up early in the morning and the sun shone upon thewater and the moabites saw the water on the other side as red asblood  and they said this is blood the kings are surely slainand they have smitten one another now therefore moab to the spoil and when they came to the camp of israel the israelites rose upand smote the moabites so that they fled before them but they wentforward smiting the moabites even in their country and they beat down the cities and on every good piece of landcast every man his stone and filled it and they stopped all thewells of water and felled all the good trees only in kirharasethleft they the stones thereof howbeit the slingers went about it andsmote it and when the king of moab saw that the battle was too sore forhim he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords to breakthrough even unto the king of edom but they could not then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in hisstead and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall and therewas great indignation against israel and they departed from him andreturned to their own land now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of theprophets unto elisha saying thy servant my husband is dead and thouknowest that thy servant did fear the lord and the creditor is cometo take unto him my two sons to be bondmen and elisha said unto her what shall i do for thee tell me whathast thou in the house and she said thine handmaid hath not anything in the house save a pot of oil then he said go borrow thee vessels abroad of all thyneighbours even empty vessels borrow not a few and when thou art come in thou shalt shut the door upon thee andupon thy sons and shalt pour out into all those vessels and thoushalt set aside that which is full so she went from him and shut the door upon her and upon hersons who brought the vessels to her and she poured out and it came to pass when the vessels were full that she saidunto her son bring me yet a vessel and he said unto her there isnot a vessel more and the oil stayed then she came and told the man of god and he said go sell theoil and pay thy debt and live thou and thy children of the rest and it fell on a day that elisha passed to shunem where was agreat woman and she constrained him to eat bread and so it was thatas oft as he passed by he turned in thither to eat bread and she said unto her husband behold now i perceive that this isan holy man of god which passeth by us continually let us make a little chamber i pray thee on the wall and letus set for him there a bed and a table and a stool and acandlestick and it shall be when he cometh to us that he shall turnin thither and it fell on a day that he came thither and he turned intothe chamber and lay there and he said to gehazi his servant call this shunammite and whenhe had called her she stood before him and he said unto him say now unto her behold thou hast beencareful for us with all this care what is to be done for theewouldest thou be spoken for to the king or to the captain of thehost and she answered i dwell among mine own people and he said what then is to be done for her and gehazianswered verily she hath no child and her husband is old and he said call her and when he had called her she stood inthe door and he said about this season according to the time of lifethou shalt embrace a son and she said nay my lord thou man of goddo not lie unto thine handmaid and the woman conceived and bare a son at that season thatelisha had said unto her according to the time of life and when the child was grown it fell on a day that he went outto his father to the reapers and he said unto his father my head my head and he said to alad carry him to his mother and when he had taken him and brought him to his mother he saton her knees till noon and then died and she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of god andshut the door upon him and went out and she called unto her husband and said send me i pray theeone of the young men and one of the asses that i may run to the manof god and come again and he said wherefore wilt thou go to him to day it is neithernew moon nor sabbath and she said it shall be well then she saddled an ass and said to her servant drive and goforward slack not thy riding for me except i bid thee so she went and came unto the man of god to mount carmel and itcame to pass when the man of god saw her afar off that he said togehazi his servant behold yonder is that shunammite  run now ipray thee to meet her and say unto her is it well with thee is itwell with thy husband is it well with the child and she answered itis well  and when she came to the man of god to the hill shecaught him by the feet but gehazi came near to thrust her away andthe man of god said let her alone for her soul is vexed within herand the lord hath hid it from me and hath not told me then she said did i desire a son of my lord did i not say donot deceive me   then he said to gehazi gird up thy loins andtake my staff in thine hand and go thy way if thou meet any mansalute him not and if any salute thee answer him not again and laymy staff upon the face of the child and the mother of the child said as the lord liveth and as thysoul liveth i will not leave thee and he arose and followed her and gehazi passed on before them and laid the staff upon theface of the child but there was neither voice nor hearing whereforehe went again to meet him and told him saying the child is notawaked and when elisha was come into the house behold the child wasdead and laid upon his bed he went in therefore and shut the door upon them twain andprayed unto the lord and he went up and lay upon the child and put his mouth uponhis mouth and his eyes upon his eyes and his hands upon his handsand stretched himself upon the child and the flesh of the child waxedwarm then he returned and walked in the house to and fro and wentup and stretched himself upon him and the child sneezed seven timesand the child opened his eyes and he called gehazi and said call this shunammite so hecalled her and when she was come in unto him he said take up thyson then she went in and fell at his feet and bowed herself to theground and took up her son and went out and elisha came again to gilgal and there was a dearth in theland and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him and hesaid unto his servant set on the great pot and seethe pottage forthe sons of the prophets and one went out into the field to gather herbs and found a wildvine and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full and came andshred them into the pot of pottage for they knew them not so they poured out for the men to eat and it came to pass asthey were eating of the pottage that they cried out and said o thouman of god there is death in the pot and they could not eat thereof but he said then bring meal and he cast it into the pot and hesaid pour out for the people that they may eat and there was noharm in the pot and there came a man from baalshalisha and brought the man ofgod bread of the firstfruits twenty loaves of barley and full earsof corn in the husk thereof and he said give unto the people thatthey may eat and his servitor said what should i set this before an hundredmen  he said again give the people that they may eat for thussaith the lord they shall eat and shall leave thereof so he set it before them and they did eat and left thereofaccording to the word of the lord now naaman captain of the host of the king of syria was a greatman with his master and honourable because by him the lord had givendeliverance unto syria he was also a mighty man in valour but he wasa leper and the syrians had gone out by companies and had brought awaycaptive out of the land of israel a little maid and she waited onnaamans wife and she said unto her mistress would god my lord were with theprophet that is in samaria for he would recover him of his leprosy and one went in and told his lord saying thus and thus said themaid that is of the land of israel and the king of syria said go to go and i will send a letterunto the king of israel and he departed and took with him tentalents of silver and six thousand pieces of gold and ten changes ofraiment and he brought the letter to the king of israel saying now whenthis letter is come unto thee behold i have therewith sent naaman myservant to thee that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy and it came to pass when the king of israel had read the letterthat he rent his clothes and said am i god to kill and to makealive that this man doth send unto me to recover a man of hisleprosy wherefore consider i pray you and see how he seeketh aquarrel against me and it was so when elisha the man of god had heard that the kingof israel had rent his clothes that he sent to the king sayingwherefore hast thou rent thy clothes let him come now to me and heshall know that there is a prophet in israel so naaman came with his horses and with his chariot and stood atthe door of the house of elisha and elisha sent a messenger unto him saying go and wash injordan seven times and thy flesh shall come again to thee and thoushalt be clean but naaman was wroth and went away and said behold i thoughthe will surely come out to me and stand and call on the name of thelord his god and strike his hand over the place and recover theleper are not abana and pharpar rivers of damascus better than allthe waters of israel may i not wash in them and be clean so heturned and went away in a rage and his servants came near and spake unto him and said myfather if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing wouldest thounot have done it how much rather then when he saith to thee washand be clean   then went he down and dipped himself seven timesin jordan according to the saying of the man of god and his fleshcame again like unto the flesh of a little child and he was clean and he returned to the man of god he and all his company andcame and stood before him and he said behold now i know that thereis no god in all the earth but in israel now therefore i pray theetake a blessing of thy servant but he said as the lord liveth before whom i stand i willreceive none and he urged him to take it but he refused and naaman said shall there not then i pray thee be given tothy servant two mules burden of earth for thy servant willhenceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice unto other godsbut unto the lord in this thing the lord pardon thy servant that when my mastergoeth into the house of rimmon to worship there and he leaneth on myhand and i bow myself in the house of rimmon when i bow down myselfin the house of rimmon the lord pardon thy servant in this thing and he said unto him go in peace so he departed from him alittle way but gehazi the servant of elisha the man of god said beholdmy master hath spared naaman this syrian in not receiving at hishands that which he brought but as the lord liveth i will run afterhim and take somewhat of him so gehazi followed after naaman and when naaman saw him runningafter him he lighted down from the chariot to meet him and said isall well   and he said all is well my master hath sent mesaying behold even now there be come to me from mount ephraim twoyoung men of the sons of the prophets give them i pray thee atalent of silver and two changes of garments and naaman said be content take two talents and he urged himand bound two talents of silver in two bags with two changes ofgarments and laid them upon two of his servants and they bare thembefore him and when he came to the tower he took them from their hand andbestowed them in the house and he let the men go and they departed but he went in and stood before his master and elisha said untohim whence comest thou gehazi and he said thy servant went nowhither and he said unto him went not mine heart with thee when the manturned again from his chariot to meet thee is it a time to receivemoney and to receive garments and oliveyards and vineyards andsheep and oxen and menservants and maidservants   the leprosytherefore of naaman shall cleave unto thee and unto thy seed forever and he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow and the sons of the prophets said unto elisha behold now theplace where we dwell with thee is too strait for us let us go we pray thee unto jordan and take thence every man abeam and let us make us a place there where we may dwell and heanswered go ye and one said be content i pray thee and go with thy servantsand he answered i will go so he went with them and when they came to jordan they cut downwood but as one was felling a beam the axe head fell into the waterand he cried and said alas master for it was borrowed and the man of god said where fell it and he shewed him theplaceand he cut down a stick and cast it in thither and the iron didswim therefore said he take it up to thee and he put out his handand took it then the king of syria warred against israel and took counselwith his servants saying in such and such a place shall be my camp and the man of god sent unto the king of israel saying bewarethat thou pass not such a place for thither the syrians are comedown and the king of israel sent to the place which the man of godtold him and warned him of and saved himself there not once nortwice therefore the heart of the king of syria was sore troubled forthis thing and he called his servants and said unto them will yenot shew me which of us is for the king of israel   and one ofhis servants said none my lord o king but elisha the prophet thatis in israel telleth the king of israel the words that thou speakestin thy bedchamber and he said go and spy where he is that i may send and fetchhimand it was told him saying behold he is in dothan therefore sent he thither horses and chariots and a great hostand they came by night and compassed the city about and when the servant of the man of god was risen early and goneforth behold an host compassed the city both with horses andchariots and his servant said unto him alas my master how shall wedo   and he answered fear not for they that be with us are morethan they that be with them and elisha prayed and said lord i pray thee open his eyesthat he may see and the lord opened the eyes of the young man and hesaw and behold the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fireround about elisha and when they came down to him elisha prayed unto the lord andsaid smite this people i pray thee with blindness and he smotethem with blindness according to the word of elisha and elisha said unto them this is not the way neither is thisthe city follow me and i will bring you to the man whom ye seek buthe led them to samaria and it came to pass when they were come into samaria thatelisha said lord open the eyes of these men that they may see andthe lord opened their eyes and they saw and behold they were inthe midst of samaria and the king of israel said unto elisha when he saw them myfather shall i smite them shall i smite them   and he answeredthou shalt not smite them wouldest thou smite those whom thou hasttaken captive with thy sword and with thy bow set bread and waterbefore them that they may eat and drink and go to their master and he prepared great provision for them and when they had eatenand drunk he sent them away and they went to their master so thebands of syria came no more into the land of israel and it came to pass after this that benhadad king of syriagathered all his host and went up and besieged samaria and there was a great famine in samaria and behold theybesieged it until an asss head was sold for fourscore pieces ofsilver and the fourth part of a cab of doves dung for five pieces ofsilver and as the king of israel was passing by upon the wall therecried a woman unto him saying help my lord o king and he said if the lord do not help thee whence shall i helpthee  out of the barnfloor or out of the winepress   and theking said unto her what aileth thee and she answered this womansaid unto me give thy son that we may eat him to day and we willeat my son to morrow so we boiled my son and did eat him and i said unto her on thenext day give thy son that we may eat him and she hath hid her son and it came to pass when the king heard the words of the womanthat he rent his clothes and he passed by upon the wall and thepeople looked and behold he had sackcloth within upon his flesh then he said god do so and more also to me if the head ofelisha the son of shaphat shall stand on him this day but elisha sat in his house and the elders sat with him and theking sent a man from before him but ere the messenger came to him hesaid to the elders see ye how this son of a murderer hath sent totake away mine head look when the messenger cometh shut the doorand hold him fast at the door is not the sound of his masters feetbehind him   and while he yet talked with them behold themessenger came down unto him and he said behold this evil is of thelord what should i wait for the lord any longer   then elishasaid hear ye the word of the lord thus saith the lord to morrowabout this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for a shekeland two measures of barley for a shekel in the gate of samaria then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of godand said behold if the lord would make windows in heaven might thisthing be  and he said behold thou shalt see it with thine eyes butshalt not eat thereof and there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gateand they said one to another why sit we here until we die   if wesay we will enter into the city then the famine is in the city andwe shall die there and if we sit still here we die also nowtherefore come and let us fall unto the host of the syrians if theysave us alive we shall live and if they kill us we shall but die and they rose up in the twilight to go unto the camp of thesyrians and when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp ofsyria behold there was no man there for the lord had made the host of the syrians to hear a noise ofchariots and a noise of horses even the noise of a great host andthey said one to another lo the king of israel hath hired against usthe kings of the hittites and the kings of the egyptians to comeupon us wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight and left theirtents and their horses and their asses even the camp as it was andfled for their life and when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp theywent into one tent and did eat and drink and carried thence silverand gold and raiment and went and hid it and came again andentered into another tent and carried thence also and went and hidit then they said one to another we do not well this day is a dayof good tidings and we hold our peace if we tarry till the morninglight some mischief will come upon us now therefore come that wemay go and tell the kings household so they came and called unto the porter of the city and theytold them saying we came to the camp of the syrians and beholdthere was no man there neither voice of man but horses tied andasses tied and the tents as they were and he called the porters and they told it to the kings housewithin and the king arose in the night and said unto his servants iwill now shew you what the syrians have done to us they know that webe hungry therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselvesin the field saying when they come out of the city we shall catchthem alive and get into the city and one of his servants answered and said let some take i praythee five of the horses that remain which are left in the citybehold they are as all the multitude of israel that are left in itbehold i say they are even as all the multitude of the israelitesthat are consumed and let us send and see they took therefore two chariot horses and the king sent afterthe host of the syrians saying go and see and they went after them unto jordan and lo all the way wasfull of garments and vessels which the syrians had cast away in theirhaste and the messengers returned and told the king and the people went out and spoiled the tents of the syrians soa measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel and two measures ofbarley for a shekel according to the word of the lord and the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to havethe charge of the gate and the people trode upon him in the gate andhe died as the man of god had said who spake when the king came downto him and it came to pass as the man of god had spoken to the kingsaying two measures of barley for a shekel and a measure of fineflour for a shekel shall be to morrow about this time in the gate ofsamaria  and that lord answered the man of god and said nowbehold if the lord should make windows in heaven might such a thingbe and he said behold thou shalt see it with thine eyes but shaltnot eat thereof and so it fell out unto him for the people trode upon him in thegate and he died then spake elisha unto the woman whose son he had restored tolife saying arise and go thou and thine household and sojournwheresoever thou canst sojourn for the lord hath called for a famineand it shall also come upon the land seven years and the woman arose and did after the saying of the man of godand she went with her household and sojourned in the land of thephilistines seven years and it came to pass at the seven years end that the womanreturned out of the land of the philistines and she went forth to cryunto the king for her house and for her land and the king talked with gehazi the servant of the man of godsaying tell me i pray thee all the great things that elisha hathdone and it came to pass as he was telling the king how he hadrestored a dead body to life that behold the woman whose son hehad restored to life cried to the king for her house and for herland and gehazi said my lord o king this is the woman and this isher son whom elisha restored to life and when the king asked the woman she told him so the kingappointed unto her a certain officer saying restore all that washers and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left theland even until now and elisha came to damascus and benhadad the king of syria wassick and it was told him saying the man of god is come hither and the king said unto hazael take a present in thine hand andgo meet the man of god and enquire of the lord by him saying shalli recover of this disease   so hazael went to meet him and took apresent with him even of every good thing of damascus forty camelsburden and came and stood before him and said thy son benhadad kingof syria hath sent me to thee saying shall i recover of thisdisease   and elisha said unto him go say unto him thou mayestcertainly recover howbeit the lord hath shewed me that he shallsurely die and he settled his countenance stedfastly until he was ashamedand the man of god wept and hazael said why weepeth my lord and he answered because iknow the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of israel theirstrong holds wilt thou set on fire and their young men wilt thou slaywith the sword and wilt dash their children and rip up their womenwith child and hazael said but what is thy servant a dog that he shoulddo this great thing and elisha answered the lord hath shewed me thatthou shalt be king over syria so he departed from elisha and came to his master who said tohim what said elisha to thee and he answered he told me that thoushouldest surely recover and it came to pass on the morrow that he took a thick clothand dipped it in water and spread it on his face so that he diedand hazael reigned in his stead and in the fifth year of joram the son of ahab king of israeljehoshaphat being then king of judah jehoram the son of je hoshaphatking of judah began to reign thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign and hereigned eight years in jerusalem and he walked in the way of the kings of israel as did the houseof ahab for the daughter of ahab was his wife and he did evil in thesight of the lord yet the lord would not destroy judah for david his servantssake as he promised him to give him alway a light and to hischildren in his days edom revolted from under the hand of judah and madea king over themselves so joram went over to zair and all the chariots with him and herose by night and smote the edomites which compassed him about andthe captains of the chariots and the people fled into their tents yet edom revolted from under the hand of judah unto this daythen libnah revolted at the same time and the rest of the acts of joram and all that he did are theynot written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah  and joram slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers inthe city of david and ahaziah his son reigned in his stead in the twelfth year of joram the son of ahab king of israel didahaziah the son of jehoram king of judah begin to reign two and twenty years old was ahaziah when he began to reign andhe reigned one year in jerusalem and his mothers name was athaliahthe daughter of omri king of israel and he walked in the way of the house of ahab and did evil inthe sight of the lord as did the house of ahab for he was the son inlaw of the house of ahab and he went with joram the son of ahab to the war against hazaelking of syria in ramothgilead and the syrians wounded joram and king joram went back to be healed in jezreel of the woundswhich the syrians had given him at ramah when he fought againsthazael king of syria and ahaziah the son of jehoram king of judahwent down to see joram the son of ahab in jezreel because he wassick and elisha the prophet called one of the children of the prophetsand said unto him gird up thy loins and take this box of oil inthine hand and go to ramothgilead  and when thou comest thitherlook out there jehu the son of jehoshaphat the son of nimshi and goin and make him arise up from among his brethren and carry him to aninner chamber  then take the box of oil and pour it on his headand say thus saith the lord i have anointed thee king over israelthen open the door and flee and tarry not so the young man even the young man the prophet went toramothgilead and when he came behold the captains of the host were sittingand he said i have an errand to thee o captain and jehu said untowhich of all us and he said to thee o captain and he arose and went into the house and he poured the oil onhis head and said unto him thus saith the lord god of israel i haveanointed thee king over the people of the lord even over israel and thou shalt smite the house of ahab thy master that i mayavenge the blood of my servants the prophets and the blood of all theservants of the lord at the hand of jezebel for the whole house of ahab shall perish and i will cut off fromahab him that pisseth against the wall and him that is shut up andleft in israel  and i will make the house of ahab like the houseof jeroboam the son of nebat and like the house of baasha the son ofahijah  and the dogs shall eat jezebel in the portion of jezreeland there shall be none to bury her and he opened the door and fled then jehu came forth to the servants of his lord and one saidunto him is all well wherefore came this mad fellow to thee and hesaid unto them ye know the man and his communication and they said it is false tell us now and he said thus andthus spake he to me saying thus saith the lord i have anointed theeking over israel then they hasted and took every man his garment and put itunder him on the top of the stairs and blew with trumpets sayingjehu is king so jehu the son of jehoshaphat the son of nimshi conspiredagainst joram now joram had kept ramothgilead he and all israelbecause of hazael king of syria but king joram was returned to be healed in jezreel of the woundswhich the syrians had given him when he fought with hazael king ofsyria  and jehu said if it be your minds then let none go forthnor escape out of the city to go to tell it in jezreel so jehu rode in a chariot and went to jezreel for joram laythereand ahaziah king of judah was come down to see joram and there stood a watchman on the tower in jezreel and he spiedthe company of jehu as he came and said i see a company and joramsaid take an horseman and send to meet them and let him say is itpeace   so there went one on horseback to meet him and saidthus saith the king is it peace and jehu said what hast thou to dowith peace turn thee behind me and the watchman told saying themessenger came to them but he cometh not again then he sent out a second on horseback which came to them andsaid thus saith the king is it peace and jehu answered what hastthou to do with peace turn thee behind me and the watchman told saying he came even unto them and comethnot again and the driving is like the driving of jehu the son ofnimshi for he driveth furiously and joram said make ready and his chariot was made ready andjoram king of israel and ahaziah king of judah went out each in hischariot and they went out against jehu and met him in the portion ofnaboth the jezreelite and it came to pass when joram saw jehu that he said is itpeace jehu and he answered what peace so long as the whoredoms ofthy mother jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many   and joramturned his hands and fled and said to ahaziah there is treachery oahaziah and jehu drew a bow with his full strength and smote jehorambetween his arms and the arrow went out at his heart and he sunkdown in his chariot then said jehu to bidkar his captain take up and cast him inthe portion of the field of naboth the jezreelite for remember howthat when i and thou rode together after ahab his father the lordlaid this burden upon him  surely i have seen yesterday the bloodof naboth and the blood of his sons saith the lord and i willrequite thee in this plat saith the lord now therefore take and casthim into the plat of ground according to the word of the lord but when ahaziah the king of judah saw this he fled by the wayof the garden house and jehu followed after him and said smite himalso in the chariot and they did so at the going up to gur which isby ibleamand he fled to megiddo and died there and his servants carried him in a chariot to jerusalem andburied him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of david and in the eleventh year of joram the son of ahab began ahaziahto reign over judah and when jehu was come to jezreel jezebel heard of it and shepainted her face and tired her head and looked out at a window and as jehu entered in at the gate she said had zimri peacewho slew his master   and he lifted up his face to the windowand said who is on my side  who and there looked out to him two orthree eunuchs and he said throw her down so they threw her down and some ofher blood was sprinkled on the wall and on the horses and he trodeher under foot and when he was come in he did eat and drink and said go seenow this cursed woman and bury her for she is a kings daughter and they went to bury her but they found no more of her than theskull and the feet and the palms of her hands wherefore they came again and told him and he said this is theword of the lord which he spake by his servant elijah the tishbitesaying in the portion of jezreel shall dogs eat the flesh of jezebel and the carcase of jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of thefield in the portion of jezreel so that they shall not say this isjezebel and ahab had seventy sons in samaria and jehu wrote letters andsent to samaria unto the rulers of jezreel to the elders and tothem that brought up ahabs children saying  now as soon as thisletter cometh to you seeing your masters sons are with you andthere are with you chariots and horses a fenced city also andarmour  look even out the best and meetest of your masters sonsand set him on his fathers throne and fight for your masters house but they were exceedingly afraid and said behold two kingsstood not before him how then shall we stand   and he that wasover the house and he that was over the city the elders also andthe bringers up of the children sent to jehu saying we are thyservants and will do all that thou shalt bid us we will not make anyking do thou that which is good in thine eyes then he wrote a letter the second time to them saying if ye bemine and if ye will hearken unto my voice take ye the heads of themen your masters sons and come to me to jezreel by to morrow thistime now the kings sons being seventy persons were with the greatmen of the city which brought them up and it came to pass when the letter came to them that they tookthe kings sons and slew seventy persons and put their heads inbaskets and sent him them to jezreel and there came a messenger and told him saying they havebrought the heads of the kings sons and he said lay ye them in twoheaps at the entering in of the gate until the morning and it came to pass in the morning that he went out and stoodand said to all the people ye be righteous behold i conspiredagainst my master and slew him but who slew all these   knownow that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the word of thelord which the lord spake concerning the house of ahab for the lordhath done that which he spake by his servant elijah so jehu slew all that remained of the house of ahab in jezreeland all his great men and his kinsfolks and his priests until heleft him none remaining and he arose and departed and came to samaria and as he was atthe shearing house in the way  jehu met with the brethren ofahaziah king of judah and said who are ye and they answered we arethe brethren of ahaziah and we go down to salute the children of theking and the children of the queen and he said take them alive and they took them alive and slewthem at the pit of the shearing house even two and forty men neitherleft he any of them and when he was departed thence he lighted on jehonadab the sonof rechab coming to meet him and he saluted him and said to him isthine heart right as my heart is with thy heart and jehonadabanswered it is if it be give me thine hand and he gave him hishand and he took him up to him into the chariot and he said come with me and see my zeal for the lord so theymade him ride in his chariot and when he came to samaria he slew all that remained unto ahabin samaria till he had destroyed him according to the saying of thelord which he spake to elijah and jehu gathered all the people together and said unto themahab served baal a little but jehu shall serve him much now therefore call unto me all the prophets of baal all hisservants and all his priests let none be wanting for i have a greatsacrifice to do to baal whosoever shall be wanting he shall notlive but jehu did it in subtilty to the intent that he might destroythe worshippers of baal and jehu said proclaim a solemn assembly for baal and theyproclaimed it and jehu sent through all israel and all the worshippers ofbaal came so that there was not a man left that came not and theycame into the house of baal and the house of baal was full from oneend to another and he said unto him that was over the vestry bring forthvestments for all the worshippers of baal and he brought them forthvestments and jehu went and jehonadab the son of rechab into the houseof baal and said unto the worshippers of baal search and look thatthere be here with you none of the servants of the lord but theworshippers of baal only and when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offeringsjehu appointed fourscore men without and said if any of the men whomi have brought into your hands escape he that letteth him go hislife shall be for the life of him and it came to pass as soon as he had made an end of offeringthe burnt offering that jehu said to the guard and to the captainsgo in and slay them let none come forth and they smote them withthe edge of the sword and the guard and the captains cast them outand went to the city of the house of baal and they brought forth the images out of the house of baal andburned them and they brake down the image of baal and brake down the houseof baal and made it a draught house unto this day thus jehu destroyed baal out of israel howbeit from the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat who madeisrael to sin jehu departed not from after them to wit the goldencalves that were in bethel and that were in dan and the lord said unto jehu because thou hast done well inexecuting that which is right in mine eyes and hast done unto thehouse of ahab according to all that was in mine heart thy children ofthe fourth generation shall sit on the throne of israel but jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the lord god ofisrael with all his heart for he departed not from the sins ofjeroboam which made israel to sin in those days the lord began to cut israel short and hazaelsmote them in all the coasts of israel  from jordan eastwardall the land of gilead the gadites and the reubenites and themanassites from aroer which is by the river arnon even gilead andbashan now the rest of the acts of jehu and all that he did and allhis might are they not written in the book of the chronicles of thekings of israel   and jehu slept with his fathers and theyburied him in samaria and jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead and the time that jehu reigned over israel in samaria was twentyand eight years and when athaliah the mother of ahaziah saw that her son wasdead she arose and destroyed all the seed royal but jehosheba the daughter of king joram sister of ahaziahtook joash the son of ahaziah and stole him from among the kingssons which were slain and they hid him even him and his nurse inthe bedchamber from athaliah so that he was not slain and he was with her hid in the house of the lord six years andathaliah did reign over the land and the seventh year jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers overhundreds with the captains and the guard and brought them to himinto the house of the lord and made a covenant with them and took anoath of them in the house of the lord and shewed them the kings son and he commanded them saying this is the thing that ye shalldo a third part of you that enter in on the sabbath shall even bekeepers of the watch of the kings house  and a third part shallbe at the gate of sur and a third part at the gate behind the guardso shall ye keep the watch of the house that it be not broken down and two parts of all you that go forth on the sabbath even theyshall keep the watch of the house of the lord about the king and ye shall compass the king round about every man with hisweapons in his hand and he that cometh within the ranges let him beslain and be ye with the king as he goeth out and as he cometh in and the captains over the hundreds did according to all thingsthat jehoiada the priest commanded and they took every man his menthat were to come in on the sabbath with them that should go out onthe sabbath and came to jehoiada the priest and to the captains over hundreds did the priest give kingdavids spears and shields that were in the temple of the lord and the guard stood every man with his weapons in his handround about the king from the right corner of the temple to the leftcorner of the temple along by the altar and the temple and he brought forth the kings son and put the crown upon himand gave him the testimony and they made him king and anointed himand they clapped their hands and said god save the king and when athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of thepeople she came to the people into the temple of the lord and when she looked behold the king stood by a pillar as themanner was and the princes and the trumpeters by the king and allthe people of the land rejoiced and blew with trumpets and athaliahrent her clothes and cried treason treason but jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundredsthe officers of the host and said unto them have her forth withoutthe ranges and him that followeth her kill with the sword for thepriest had said let her not be slain in the house of the lord and they laid hands on her and she went by the way by the whichthe horses came into the kings house and there was she slain and jehoiada made a covenant between the lord and the king andthe people that they should be the lords people between the kingalso and the people and all the people of the land went into the house of baal andbrake it down his altars and his images brake they in piecesthoroughly and slew mattan the priest of baal before the altars andthe priest appointed officers over the house of the lord and he took the rulers over hundreds and the captains and theguard and all the people of the land and they brought down the kingfrom the house of the lord and came by the way of the gate of theguard to the kings house and he sat on the throne of the kings and all the people of the land rejoiced and the city was inquiet and they slew athaliah with the sword beside the kings house seven years old was jehoash when he began to reign in the seventh year of jehu jehoash began to reign and fortyyears reigned he in jerusalem and his mothers name was zibiah ofbeersheba and jehoash did that which was right in the sight of the lord allhis days wherein jehoiada the priest instructed him but the high places were not taken away the people stillsacrificed and burnt incense in the high places and jehoash said to the priests all the money of the dedicatedthings that is brought into the house of the lord even the money ofevery one that passeth the account the money that every man is setat and all the money that cometh into any mans heart to bring intothe house of the lord  let the priests take it to them every manof his acquaintance and let them repair the breaches of the housewheresoever any breach shall be found but it was so that in the three and twentieth year of kingjehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house then king jehoash called for jehoiada the priest and the otherpriests and said unto them why repair ye not the breaches of thehouse now therefore receive no more money of your acquaintance butdeliver it for the breaches of the house and the priests consented to receive no more money of the peopleneither to repair the breaches of the house but jehoiada the priest took a chest and bored a hole in the lidof it and set it beside the altar on the right side as one comethinto the house of the lord and the priests that kept the door puttherein all the money that was brought into the house of the lord and it was so when they saw that there was much money in thechest that the kings scribe and the high priest came up and theyput up in bags and told the money that was found in the house of thelord and they gave the money being told into the hands of them thatdid the work that had the oversight of the house of the lord andthey laid it out to the carpenters and builders that wrought upon thehouse of the lord  and to masons and hewers of stone and tobuy timber and hewed stone to repair the breaches of the house of thelord and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it howbeit there were not made for the house of the lord bowls ofsilver snuffers basons trumpets any vessels of gold or vessels ofsilver of the money that was brought into the house of the lord but they gave that to the workmen and repaired therewith thehouse of the lord moreover they reckoned not with the men into whose hand theydelivered the money to be bestowed on workmen for they dealtfaithfully the trespass money and sin money was not brought into the houseof the lord it was the priests then hazael king of syria went up and fought against gath andtook it and hazael set his face to go up to jerusalem and jehoash king of judah took all the hallowed things thatjehoshaphat and jehoram and ahaziah his fathers kings of judahhad dedicated and his own hallowed things and all the gold that wasfound in the treasures of the house of the lord and in the kingshouse and sent it to hazael king of syria and he went away fromjerusalem and the rest of the acts of joash and all that he did are theynot written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah and his servants arose and made a conspiracy and slew joash inthe house of millo which goeth down to silla for jozachar the son of shimeath and jehozabad the son ofshomer his servants smote him and he died and they buried him withhis fathers in the city of david and amaziah his son reigned in hisstead in the three and twentieth year of joash the son of ahaziah kingof judah jehoahaz the son of jehu began to reign over israel insamaria and reigned seventeen years and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord andfollowed the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat which made israel tosin he departed not therefrom and the anger of the lord was kindled against israel and hedelivered them into the hand of hazael king of syria and into thehand of benhadad the son of hazael all their days and jehoahaz besought the lord and the lord hearkened unto himfor he saw the oppression of israel because the king of syriaoppressed them and the lord gave israel a saviour so that they went out fromunder the hand of the syrians and the children of israel dwelt intheir tents as beforetime nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house ofjeroboam who made israel sin but walked therein and there remainedthe grove also in samaria   neither did he leave of the peopleto jehoahaz but fifty horsemen and ten chariots and ten thousandfootmen for the king of syria had destroyed them and had made themlike the dust by threshing now the rest of the acts of jehoahaz and all that he did andhis might are they not written in the book of the chronicles of thekings of israel   and jehoahaz slept with his fathers and theyburied him in samaria and joash his son reigned in his stead in the thirty and

judah are they notwritten in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel  and joash slept with his fathers and jeroboam sat upon his throneand joash was buried in samaria with the kings of

thehorsemen thereof and elisha said unto him take bow and arrows and he took untohim bow and arrows and he said to the king of israel put thine hand upon the bowand he put his hand upon it and elisha put his hands upon the kingshands and he said open the window eastward and he opened it thenelisha said shoot and he shot and he said the arrow of the lordsdeliverance and the arrow of deliverance from syria for thou shaltsmite the syrians in aphek till thou have consumed them and he said take the arrows and he took them and he said untothe king of israel smite upon the ground and he smote thrice andstayed and the man of god was wroth with him and said thou shouldesthave smitten five or six times then hadst thou smitten syria tillthou hadst consumed it whereas now thou shalt smite syria but thrice and elisha died and they buried him and the bands of themoabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year and it came to pass as they were burying a man that beholdthey spied a band of men and they cast the man into the sepulchre ofelisha and when the man was let down and touched the bones ofelisha he revived and stood up on his feet but hazael king of syria oppressed israel all the days ofjehoahaz and the lord was gracious unto them and had compassion on themand had respect unto them because of his covenant with abrahamisaac and jacob and would not destroy them neither cast he themfrom his presence as yet so hazael king of syria died and benhadad his son reigned inhis stead and jehoash the son of jehoahaz took again out of the hand ofbenhadad the son of hazael the cities

green tree  and there they burnt incense in all thehigh places as did the heathen whom the lord carried away beforethem and wrought wicked things to provoke the lord to anger for they served idols whereof the lord had said unto them ye shallnot do this thing yet the lord testified against israel and against judah by allthe prophets and by all the seers saying turn ye from your evilways and keep my commandments and my statutes according to all thelaw which i commanded your fathers and which i sent to you by myservants the prophets notwithstanding they would not hear but hardened their neckslike to the neck of their fathers that did not believe in the lordtheir god and they rejected his statutes and his covenant that he madewith their fathers and his testimonies which he testified againstthem and they followed vanity and became vain and went after theheathen that were round about them concerning whom the lord hadcharged them that they should not do like them and they left all the commandments of the lord their god andmade them molten images even two calves and made a grove andworshipped all the host of heaven and served baal and they caused their sons and their daughters to pass throughthe fire and used divination and enchantments and sold themselves todo evil in the sight of the lord to provoke him to anger therefore the lord was very angry with israel and removed themout of his sight there was none left but the tribe of judah only also judah kept not the commandments of the lord their god butwalked in the statutes of israel which they made and the lord rejected all the seed of israel and afflictedthem and delivered them into the hand of spoilers until he had castthem out of his sight for he rent israel from the house of david and they madejeroboam the son of nebat king and jeroboam drave israel fromfollowing the lord and made them sin a great sin for the children of israel walked in all the sins of jeroboamwhich he did they departed not from them  until the lordremoved israel out of his sight as he had said by all his servantsthe prophets so was israel carried away out of their own land toassyria unto this day and the king of assyria brought men from babylon and fromcuthah and from ava and from hamath and from sepharvaim and placedthem in the cities of samaria instead of the children of israel andthey possessed samaria and dwelt in the cities thereof and so it was at the beginning of their dwelling there thatthey feared not the lord therefore the lord sent lions among themwhich slew some of them wherefore they spake to the king of assyria saying the nationswhich thou hast removed and placed in the cities of samaria know notthe manner of the god of the land therefore he hath sent lions amongthem and behold they slay them because they know not the manner ofthe god of the land then the king of assyria commanded saying carry thither one ofthe priests whom ye brought from thence and let them go and dwellthere and let him teach them the manner of the god of the land then one of the priests whom they had carried away from samariacame and dwelt in bethel and taught them how they should fear thelord howbeit every nation made gods of their own and put them in thehouses of the high places which the samaritans had made every nationin their cities wherein they dwelt and the men of babylon made succothbenoth and the men of cuthmade nergal and the men of hamath made ashima  and the avitesmade nibhaz and tartak and the sepharvites burnt their children infire to adrammelech and anammelech the gods of sepharvaim so they feared the lord and made unto themselves of the lowestof them priests of the high places which sacrificed for them in thehouses of the high places they feared the lord and served their own gods after themanner of the nations whom they carried away from thence unto this day they do after the former manners they fear notthe lord neither do they after their statutes or after theirordinances or after the law and commandment which the lord commandedthe children of jacob whom he named israel  with whom the lordhad made a covenant and charged them saying ye shall not fear othergods nor bow yourselves to them nor serve them nor sacrifice tothem  but the lord who brought you up out of the land of egyptwith great power and a stretched out arm him shall ye fear and himshall ye worship and to him shall ye do sacrifice and the statutes and the ordinances and the law and thecommandment which he wrote for you ye shall observe to do forevermore and ye shall not fear other gods and the covenant that i have made with you ye shall not forgetneither shall ye fear other gods but the lord your god ye shall fear and he shall deliver youout of the hand of all your enemies howbeit they did not hearken but they did after their formermanner so these nations feared the lord and served their gravenimages both their children and their childrens children as didtheir fathers so do they unto this day now it came to pass in the third year of hoshea son of elah kingof israel that hezekiah the son of ahaz king of judah began to reign twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign and hereigned twenty and nine years in jerusalem his mothers name also wasabi the daughter of zachariah and he did that which was right in the sight of the lordaccording to all that david his father did he removed the high places and brake the images and cut downthe groves and brake in pieces the brasen serpent that moses hadmade for unto those days the children of israel did burn incense toit and he called it nehushtan he trusted in the lord god of israel so that after him was nonelike him among all the kings of judah nor any that were before him for he clave to the lord and departed not from following himbut kept his commandments which the lord commanded moses and the lord was with him and he prospered whithersoever he wentforth and he rebelled against the king of assyria and served himnot he smote the philistines even unto gaza and the bordersthereof from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city and it came to pass in the fourth year of king hezekiah whichwas the seventh year of hoshea son of elah king of israel thatshalmaneser king of assyria came up against samaria and besieged it and at the end of three years they took it even in the sixthyear of hezekiah that is in the ninth year of hoshea king of israelsamaria was taken and the king of assyria did carry away israel unto assyria andput them in halah and in habor by the river of gozan and in thecities of the medes  because they obeyed not the voice of thelord their god but transgressed his covenant and all that moses theservant of the lord commanded and would not hear them nor do them now in the fourteenth year of king hezekiah did sennacherib kingof assyria come up against all the fenced cities of judah and tookthem and hezekiah king of judah sent to the king of assyria tolachish saying i have offended return from me that which thouputtest on me will i bear and the king of assyria appointed untohezekiah king of judah three hundred talents of silver and thirtytalents of gold and hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the houseof the lord and in the treasures of the kings house at that time did hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of thetemple of the lord and from the pillars which hezekiah king of judahhad overlaid and gave it to the king of assyria and the king of assyria sent tartan and rabsaris and rabshakehfrom lachish to king hezekiah with a great host against jerusalem andthey went up and came to jerusalem and when they were come up theycame and stood by the conduit of the upper pool which is in thehighway of the fullers field and when they had called to the king there came out to themeliakim the son of hilkiah which was over the household and shebnathe scribe and joah the son of asaph the recorder and rabshakeh said unto them speak ye now to hezekiah thussaith the great king the king of assyria what confidence is thiswherein thou trustest   thou sayest but they are but vainwords i have counsel and strength for the war now on whom dost thoutrust that thou rebellest against me   now behold thoutrustest upon the staff of this bruised reed even upon egypt onwhich if a man lean it will go into his hand and pierce it so ispharaoh king of egypt unto all that trust on him but if ye say unto me we trust in the lord our god is not thathe whose high places and whose altars hezekiah hath taken away andhath said to judah and jerusalem ye shall worship before this altarin jerusalem   now therefore i pray thee give pledges to mylord the king of assyria and i will deliver thee two thousand horsesif thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them how then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of theleast of my masters servants and put thy trust on egypt for chariotsand for horsemen   am i now come up without the lord againstthis place to destroy it  the lord said to me go up against thisland and destroy it then said eliakim the son of hilkiah and shebna and joah untorabshakeh speak i pray thee to thy servants in the syrian languagefor we understand it and talk not with us in the jews language inthe ears of the people that are on the wall but rabshakeh said unto them hath my master sent me to thymaster and to thee to speak these words hath he not sent me to themen which sit on the wall that they may eat their own dung and drinktheir own piss with you   then rabshakeh stood and cried with aloud voice in the jews language and spake saying hear the word ofthe great king the king of assyria  thus saith the king letnot hezekiah deceive you for he shall not be able to deliver you outof his hand  neither let hezekiah make you trust in the lordsaying the lord will surely deliver us and this city shall not bedelivered into the hand of the king of assyria hearken not to hezekiah for thus saith the king of assyriamake an agreement with me by a present and come out to me and theneat ye every man of his own vine and every one of his fig tree anddrink ye every one the waters of his cistern  until i come andtake you away to a land like your own land a land of corn and wine aland of bread and vineyards a land of oil olive and of honey that yemay live and not die and hearken not unto hezekiah when hepersuadeth you saying the lord will deliver us hath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his landout of the hand of the king of assyria   where are the gods ofhamath and of arpad where are the gods of sepharvaim hena andivah have they delivered samaria out of mine hand   who arethey among all the gods of the countries that have delivered theircountry out of mine hand that the lord should deliver jerusalem outof mine hand   but the people held their peace and answered himnot a word for the kings commandment was saying answer him not then came eliakim the son of hilkiah which was over thehousehold and shebna the scribe and joah the son of asaph therecorder to hezekiah with their clothes rent and told him the wordsof rabshakeh and it came to pass when king hezekiah heard it that he renthis clothes and covered himself with sackcloth and went into thehouse of the lord and he sent eliakim which was over the household and shebna thescribe and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth toisaiah the prophet the son of amoz and they said unto him thus saith hezekiah this day is a day oftrouble and of rebuke and blasphemy for the children are come tothe birth and there is not strength to bring forth it may be the lord thy god will hear all the words of rabshakehwhom the king of assyria his master hath sent to reproach the livinggod and will reprove the words which the lord thy god hath heardwherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that are left so the servants of king hezekiah came to isaiah and isaiah said unto them thus shall ye say to your master thussaith the lord be not afraid of the words which thou hast heard withwhich the servants of the king of assyria have blasphemed me behold i will send a blast upon him and he shall hear a rumourand shall return to his own land and i will cause him to fall by thesword in his own land so rabshakeh returned and found the king of assyria warringagainst libnah for he had heard that he was departed from lachish and when he heard say of tirhakah king of ethiopia behold he iscome out to fight against thee he sent messengers again untohezekiah saying  thus shall ye speak to hezekiah king of judahsaying let not thy god in whom thou trustest deceive thee sayingjerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of assyria behold thou hast heard what the kings of assyria have done toall lands by destroying them utterly and shalt thou be delivered have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathershave destroyed as gozan and haran and rezeph and the children ofeden which were in thelasar   where is the king of hamath andthe king of arpad and the king of the city of sepharvaim of henaand ivah   and hezekiah received the letter of the hand of themessengers and read it and hezekiah went up into the house of thelord and spread it before the lord and hezekiah prayed before the lord and said o lord god ofisrael which dwellest between the cherubims thou art the god eventhou alone of all the kingdoms of the earth thou hast made heavenand earth lord bow down thine ear and hear open lord thine eyes andsee and hear the words of sennacherib which hath sent him toreproach the living god of a truth lord the kings of assyria have destroyed thenations and their lands  and have cast their gods into the firefor they were no gods but the work of mens hands wood and stonetherefore they have destroyed them now therefore o lord our god i beseech thee save thou us outof his hand that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou artthe lord god even thou only then isaiah the son of amoz sent to hezekiah saying thus saiththe lord god of israel that which thou hast prayed to me againstsennacherib king of assyria i have heard this is the word that the lord hath spoken concerning him thevirgin the daughter of zion hath despised thee and laughed thee toscorn the daughter of jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed and against whom hastthou exalted thy voice and lifted up thine eyes on high even againstthe holy one of israel by thy messengers thou hast reproached the lord and hast saidwith the multitude of my chariots i am come up to the height of themountains to the sides of lebanon and will cut down the tall cedartrees thereof and the choice fir trees thereof and i will enter intothe lodgings of his borders and into the forest of his carmel i have digged and drunk strange waters and with the sole of myfeet have i dried up all the rivers of besieged places hast thou not heard long ago how i have done it and of ancienttimes that i have formed it now have i brought it to pass that thoushouldest be to lay waste fenced cities into ruinous heaps therefore their inhabitants were of small power they weredismayed and confounded they were as the grass of the field and asthe green herb as the grass on the house tops and as corn blastedbefore it be grown up but i know thy abode and thy going out and thy coming in andthy rage against me because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into mineears therefore i will put my hook in thy nose and my bridle in thylips and i will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest and this shall be a sign unto thee ye shall eat this year suchthings as grow of themselves and in the second year that whichspringeth of the same and in the third year sow ye and reap andplant vineyards and eat the fruits thereof and the remnant that is escaped of the house of judah shall yetagain take root downward and bear fruit upward for out of jerusalem shall go forth a remnant and they thatescape out of mount zion the zeal of the lord of hosts shall do this therefore thus saith the lord concerning the king of assyria heshall not come into this city nor shoot an arrow there nor comebefore it with shield nor cast a bank against it by the way that he came by the same shall he return and shallnot come into this city saith the lord for i will defend this city to save it for mine own sake andfor my servant davids sake and it came to pass that night that the angel of the lord wentout and smote in the camp of the assyrians an hundred fourscore andfive thousand and when they arose early in the morning behold theywere all dead corpses so sennacherib king of assyria departed and went and returnedand dwelt at nineveh and it came to pass as he was worshipping in the house ofnisroch his god that adrammelech and sharezer his sons smote him withthe sword and they escaped into the land of armenia and esarhaddonhis son reigned in his stead in those days was hezekiah sick unto death and the prophetisaiah the son of amoz came to him and said unto him thus saith thelord set thine house in order for thou shalt die and not live then he turned his face to the wall and prayed unto the lordsaying  i beseech thee o lord remember now how i have walkedbefore thee in truth and with a perfect heart and have done thatwhich is good in thy sight and hezekiah wept sore and it came to pass afore isaiah was gone out into the middlecourt that the word of the lord came to him saying  turn againand tell hezekiah the captain of my people thus saith the lord thegod of david thy father i have heard thy prayer i have seen thytears behold i will heal thee on the third day thou shalt go upunto the house of the lord and i will add unto thy days fifteen years and i will deliverthee and this city out of the hand of the king of assyria and i willdefend this city for mine own sake and for my servant davids sake and isaiah said take a lump of figs and they took and laid iton the boil and he recovered and hezekiah said unto isaiah what shall be the sign that thelord will heal me and that i shall go up into the house of the lordthe third day   and isaiah said this sign shalt thou have of thelord that the lord will do the thing that he hath spoken shall theshadow go forward ten degrees or go back ten degrees   andhezekiah answered it is a light thing for the shadow to go down tendegrees nay but let the shadow return backward ten degrees and isaiah the prophet cried unto the lord and he brought theshadow ten degrees backward by which it had gone down in the dial ofahaz at that time berodachbaladan the son of baladan king ofbabylon sent letters and a present unto hezekiah for he had heardthat hezekiah had been sick and hezekiah hearkened unto them and shewed them all the houseof his precious things the silver and the gold and the spices andthe precious ointment and all the house of his armour and all thatwas found in his treasures there was nothing in his house nor in allhis dominion that hezekiah shewed them not then came isaiah the prophet unto king hezekiah and said untohim what said these men and from whence came they unto thee andhezekiah said they are come from a far country even from babylon and he said what have they seen in thine house and hezekiahanswered all the things that are in mine house have they seen thereis nothing among my treasures that i have not shewed them and isaiah said unto hezekiah hear the word of the lord behold the days come that all that is in thine house and thatwhich thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day shall becarried into babylon nothing shall be left saith the lord and of thy sons that shall issue from thee which thou shaltbeget shall they take away and they shall be eunuchs in the palaceof the king of babylon then said hezekiah unto isaiah good is the word of the lordwhich thou hast spoken and he said is it not good if peace andtruth be in my days   and the rest of the acts of hezekiah andall his might and how he made a pool and a conduit and broughtwater into the city are they not written in the book of thechronicles of the kings of judah   and hezekiah slept with hisfathers and manasseh his son reigned in his stead manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign and reignedfifty and five years in jerusalem and his mothers name washephzibah and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord afterthe abominations of the heathen whom the lord cast out before thechildren of israel for he built up again the high places which hezekiah his fatherhad destroyed and he reared up altars for baal and made a grove asdid ahab king of israel and worshipped all the host of heaven andserved them and he built altars in the house of the lord of which the lordsaid in jerusalem will i put my name and he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courtsof the house of the lord and he made his son pass through the fire and observed timesand used enchantments and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards hewrought much wickedness in the sight of the lord to provoke him toanger and he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in thehouse of which the lord said to david and to solomon his son inthis house and in jerusalem which i have chosen out of all tribes ofisrael will i put my name for ever  neither will i make the feetof israel move any more out of the land which i gave their fathersonly if they will observe to do according to all that i have commandedthem and according to all the law that my servant moses commandedthem but they hearkened not and manasseh seduced them to do more evilthan did the nations whom the lord destroyed before the children ofisrael and the lord spake by his servants the prophets saying because manasseh king of judah hath done these abominations and hathdone wickedly above all that the amorites did which were before himand hath made judah also to sin with his idols  therefore thussaith the lord god of israel behold i am bringing such evil uponjerusalem and judah that whosoever heareth of it both his ears shalltingle and i will stretch over jerusalem the line of samaria and theplummet of the house of ahab and i will wipe jerusalem as a manwipeth a dish wiping it and turning it upside down and i will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance and deliverthem into the hand of their enemies and they shall become a prey anda spoil to all their enemies  because they have done that whichwas evil in my sight and have provoked me to anger since the daytheir fathers came forth out of egypt even unto this day moreover manasseh shed innocent blood very much till he hadfilled jerusalem from one end to another beside his sin wherewith hemade judah to sin in doing that which was evil in the sight of thelord now the rest of the acts of manasseh and all that he did andhis sin that he sinned are they not written in the book of thechronicles of the kings of judah   and manasseh slept with hisfathers and was buried in the garden of his own house in the gardenof uzza and amon his son reigned in his stead amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign and hereigned two years in jerusalem and his mothers name wasmeshullemeth the daughter of haruz of jotbah and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord as hisfather manasseh did and he walked in all the way that his father walked in andserved the idols that his father served and worshipped them and he forsook the lord god of his fathers and walked not in the wayof the lord and the servants of amon conspired against him and slew theking in his own house and the people of the land slew all them that had conspiredagainst king amon and the people of the land made josiah his son kingin his stead now the rest of the acts of amon which he did are they notwritten in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah  and he was buried in his sepulchre in the garden of uzza and josiahhis son reigned in his stead josiah was eight years old when he began to reign and he reignedthirty and one years in jerusalem and his mothers name was jedidahthe daughter of adaiah of boscath and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord andwalked in all the way of david his father and turned not aside to theright hand or to the left and it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king josiah thatthe king sent shaphan the son of azaliah the son of meshullam thescribe to the house of the lord saying  go up to hilkiah thehigh priest that he may sum the silver which is brought into thehouse of the lord which the keepers of the door have gathered of thepeople  and let them deliver it into the hand of the doers of thework that have the oversight of the house of the lord and let themgive it to the doers of the work which is in the house of the lord torepair the breaches of the house  unto carpenters and buildersand masons and to buy timber and hewn stone to repair the house howbeit there was no reckoning made with them of the money thatwas delivered into their hand because they dealt faithfully and hilkiah the high priest said unto shaphan the scribe i havefound the book of the law in the house of the lord and hilkiah gavethe book to shaphan and he read it and shaphan the scribe came to the king and brought the kingword again and said thy servants have gathered the money that wasfound in the house and have delivered it into the hand of them thatdo the work that have the oversight of the house of the lord and shaphan the scribe shewed the king saying hilkiah thepriest hath delivered me a book and shaphan read it before the king and it came to pass when the king had heard the words of thebook of the law that he rent his clothes and the king commanded hilkiah the priest and ahikam the son ofshaphan and achbor the son of michaiah and shaphan the scribe andasahiah a servant of the kings saying  go ye enquire of thelord for me and for the people and for all judah concerning thewords of this book that is found for great is the wrath of the lordthat is kindled against us because our fathers have not hearkenedunto the words of this book to do according unto all that which iswritten concerning us so hilkiah the priest and ahikam and achbor and shaphan andasahiah went unto huldah the prophetess the wife of shallum the sonof tikvah the son of harhas keeper of the wardrobe now she dweltin jerusalem in the college and they communed with her and she said unto them thus saith the lord god of israel tellthe man that sent you to me  thus saith the lord behold i willbring evil upon this place and upon the inhabitants thereof even allthe words of the book which the king of judah hath read  becausethey have forsaken me and have burned incense unto other gods thatthey might provoke me to anger with all the works of their handstherefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place and shall notbe quenched but to the king of judah which sent you to enquire of the lordthus shall ye say to him thus saith the lord god of israel astouching the words which thou hast heard  because thine heartwas tender and thou hast humbled thyself before the lord when thouheardest what i spake against this place and against the inhabitantsthereof that they should become a desolation and a curse and hastrent thy clothes and wept before me i also have heard thee saiththe lord behold therefore i will gather thee unto thy fathers and thoushalt be gathered into thy grave in peace and thine eyes shall notsee all the evil which i will bring upon this place and they broughtthe king word again and the king sent and they gathered unto him all the elders ofjudah and of jerusalem and the king went up into the house of the lord and all the menof judah and all the inhabitants of jerusalem with him and thepriests and the prophets and all the people both small and greatand he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenantwhich was found in the house of the lord and the king stood by a pillar and made a covenant before thelord to walk after the lord and to keep his commandments and histestimonies and his statutes with all their heart and all their soulto perform the words of this covenant that were written in this bookand all the people stood to the covenant and the king commanded hilkiah the high priest and the priestsof the second order and the keepers of the door to bring forth outof the temple of the lord all the vessels that were made for baal andfor the grove and for all the host of heaven and he burned themwithout jerusalem in the fields of kidron and carried the ashes ofthem unto bethel and he put down the idolatrous priests whom the kings of judahhad ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities ofjudah and in the places round about jerusalem them also that burnedincense unto baal to the sun and to the moon and to the planetsand to all the host of heaven and he brought out the grove from the house of the lord withoutjerusalem unto the brook kidron and burned it at the brook kidronand stamped it small to powder and cast the powder thereof upon thegraves of the children of the people and he brake down the houses of the sodomites that were by thehouse of the lord where the women wove hangings for the grove and he brought all the priests out of the cities of judah anddefiled the high places where the priests had burned incense fromgeba to beersheba and brake down the high places of the gates thatwere in the entering in of the gate of joshua the governor of thecity which were on a mans left hand at the gate of the city nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to thealtar of the lord in jerusalem but they did eat of the unleavenedbread among their brethren and he defiled topheth which is in the valley of the childrenof hinnom that no man might make his son or his daughter to passthrough the fire to molech and he took away the horses that the kings of judah had given tothe sun at the entering in of the house of the lord by the chamberof nathanmelech the chamberlain which was in the suburbs and burnedthe chariots of the sun with fire and the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber ofahaz which the kings of judah had made and the altars which manassehhad made in the two courts of the house of the lord did the king beatdown and brake them down from thence and cast the dust of them intothe brook kidron and the high places that were before jerusalem which were onthe right hand of the mount of corruption which solomon the king ofisrael had builded for ashtoreth the abomination of the zidonians andfor chemosh the abomination of the moabites and for milcom theabomination of the children of ammon did the king defile and he brake in pieces the images and cut down the groves andfilled their places with the bones of men moreover the altar that was at bethel and the high place whichjeroboam the son of nebat who made israel to sin had made both thataltar and the high place he brake down and burned the high place andstamped it small to powder and burned the grove and as josiah turned himself he spied the sepulchres that werethere in the mount and sent and took the bones out of thesepulchres and burned them upon the altar and polluted it accordingto the word of the lord which the man of god proclaimed whoproclaimed these words then he said what title is that that i see and the men of thecity told him it is the sepulchre of the man of god which came fromjudah and proclaimed these things that thou hast done against thealtar of bethel and he said let him alone let no man move his bones so theylet his bones alone with the bones of the prophet that came out ofsamaria and all the houses also of the high places that were in thecities of samaria which the kings of israel had made to provoke thelord to anger josiah took away and did to them according to all theacts that he had done in bethel and he slew all the priests of the high places that were thereupon the altars and burned mens bones upon them and returned tojerusalem and the king commanded all the people saying keep the passoverunto the lord your god as it is written in the book of this covenant surely there was not holden such a passover from the days of thejudges that judged israel nor in all the days of the kings of israelnor of the kings of judah  but in the eighteenth year of kingjosiah wherein this passover was holden to the lord in jerusalem moreover the workers with familiar spirits and the wizards andthe images and the idols and all the abominations that were spied inthe land of judah and in jerusalem did josiah put away that he mightperform the words of the law which were written in the book thathilkiah the priest found in the house of the lord and like unto him was there no king before him that turned tothe lord with all his heart and with all his soul and with all hismight according to all the law of moses neither after him arosethere any like him notwithstanding the lord turned not from the fierceness of hisgreat wrath wherewith his anger was kindled against judah because ofall the provocations that manasseh had provoked him withal and the lord said i will remove judah also out of my sight asi have removed israel and will cast off this city jerusalem which ihave chosen and the house of which i said my name shall be there now the rest of the acts of josiah and all that he did arethey not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah in his days pharaohnechoh king of egypt went up against the kingof assyria to the river euphrates and king josiah went against himand he slew him at megiddo when he had seen him and his servants carried him in a chariot dead from megiddo andbrought him to jerusalem and buried him in his own sepulchre and thepeople of the land took jehoahaz the son of josiah and anointed himand made him king in his fathers stead jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reignand he reigned three months in jerusalem and his mothers name washamutal the daughter of jeremiah of libnah and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lordaccording to all that his fathers had done and pharaohnechoh put him in bands at riblah in the land ofhamath that he might not reign in jerusalem and put the land to atribute of an hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold and pharaohnechoh made eliakim the son of josiah king in theroom of josiah his father and turned his name to jehoiakim and tookjehoahaz away and he came to egypt and died there and jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to pharaoh but hetaxed the land to give the money according to the commandment ofpharaoh he exacted the silver and the gold of the people of the landof every one according to his taxation to give it unto pharaohnechoh jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reignand he reigned eleven years in jerusalem and his mothers name waszebudah the daughter of pedaiah of rumah and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lordaccording to all that his fathers had done in his days nebuchadnezzar king of babylon came up and jehoiakimbecame his servant three years then he turned and rebelled againsthim and the lord sent against him bands of

had six sons whose names are these azrikam bocheruand ishmael and sheariah and obadiah and hanan these were the sonsof azel now the philistines fought against israel and the men of israelfled from before the philistines and fell down slain in mount gilboa and the philistines followed hard after saul and after his sonsand the philistines slew jonathan and abinadab and malchishua thesons of saul and the battle went sore against saul and the archers hit himand he was wounded of the archers then said saul to his armourbearer draw thy sword and thrust methrough therewith lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me but hisarmourbearer would not for he was sore afraid so saul took a swordand fell upon it and when his armourbearer saw that saul was dead he felllikewise on the sword and died so saul died and his three sons and all his house diedtogether and when all the men of israel that were in the valley saw thatthey fled and that saul and his sons were dead then they forsooktheir cities and fled and the philistines came and dwelt in them and it came to pass on the morrow when the philistines came tostrip the slain that they found saul and his sons fallen in mountgilboa and when they had stripped him they took his head and hisarmour and sent into the land of the philistines round about tocarry tidings unto their idols and to the people and they put his armour in the house of their gods and fastenedhis head in the temple of dagon and when all jabeshgilead heard all that the philistines haddone to saul  they arose all the valiant men and took away thebody of saul and the bodies of his sons and brought them to jabeshand buried their bones under the oak in jabesh and fasted seven days so saul died for his transgression which he committed againstthe lord even against the word of the lord which he kept not andalso for asking counsel of one that had a familiar spirit to enquireof it  and enquired not of the lord therefore he slew him andturned the kingdom unto david the son of jesse then all israel gathered themselves to david unto hebron sayingbehold we are thy bone and thy flesh and moreover in time past even when saul was king thou wast hethat leddest out and broughtest in israel and the lord thy god saidunto thee thou shalt feed my people israel and thou shalt be rulerover my people israel therefore came all the elders of israel to the king to hebronand david made a covenant with them in hebron before the lord andthey anointed david king over israel according to the word of thelord by samuel and david and all israel went to jerusalem which is jebus wherethe jebusites were the inhabitants of the land and the inhabitants of jebus said to david thou shalt not comehither nevertheless david took the castle of zion which is the cityof david and david said whosoever smiteth the jebusites first shall bechief and captain so joab the son of zeruiah went first up and waschief and david dwelt in the castle therefore they called it the cityof david and he built the city round about even from millo round aboutand joab repaired the rest of the city so david waxed greater and greater for the lord of hosts waswith him these also are the chief of the mighty men whom david had whostrengthened themselves with him in his kingdom and with all israelto make him king according to the word of the lord concerning israel and this is the number of the mighty men whom david hadjashobeam an hachmonite the chief of the captains he lifted up hisspear against three hundred slain by him at one time and after him was eleazar the son of dodo the ahohite who wasone of the three mighties he was with david at pasdammim and there the philistines weregathered together to battle where was a parcel of ground full ofbarley and the people fled from before the philistines and they set themselves in the midst of that parcel anddelivered it and slew the philistines and the lord saved them by agreat deliverance now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to davidinto the cave of adullam and the host of the philistines encamped inthe valley of rephaim and david was then in the hold and the philistines garrisonwas then at bethlehem and david longed and said oh that one would give me drink ofthe water of the well of bethlehem that is at the gate   andthe three brake through the host of the philistines and drew waterout of the well of bethlehem that was by the gate and took it andbrought it to david but david would not drink of it but poured itout to the lord and said my god forbid it me that i should do this thingshall i drink the blood of these men that have put their lives injeopardy for with the jeopardy of their lives they brought ittherefore he would not drink itthese things did these three mightiest and abishai the brother of joab he was chief of the three forlifting up his spear against three hundred he slew them and had aname among the three of the three he was more honourable than the two for he wastheir captain howbeit he

these are they that went over jordan in the first month when ithad overflown all his banks and they put to flight all them of thevalleys both toward the east and toward the west and there came of the children of benjamin and judah to the holdunto david and david went out to meet them and answered and said untothem if ye be come peaceably unto me to help me mine heart shall beknit unto you but if ye be come to betray me to mine enemies seeingthere is no wrong in mine hands the god of our fathers look thereonand rebuke it then the spirit came upon amasai who was chief of the captainsand he said thine are we david and on thy side thou son of jessepeace peace be unto thee and peace be to thine helpers for thy godhelpeth theethen david received them and made them captains of the band and there fell some of manasseh to david when he came with thephilistines against saul to battle but they helped them not for thelords of the philistines upon advisement sent him away saying hewill fall to his master saul to the jeopardy of our heads as he went to ziklag there fell to him of manasseh adnah andjozabad and jediael and michael and jozabad and elihu andzilthai captains of the thousands that were of manasseh and they helped david against the band of the rovers for theywere all mighty men of valour and were captains in the host for at that time day by day there came to david to help himuntil it was a great host like the host of god and these are the numbers of the bands that were ready armed tothe war and came to david to hebron to turn the kingdom of saul tohim according to the word of the lord the children of judah that bare shield and spear were sixthousand and eight hundred ready armed to the war of the children of simeon mighty men of valour for the warseven thousand and one hundred of the children of levi four thousand and six hundred and jehoiada was the leader of the aaronites and with him werethree thousand and seven hundred  and zadok a young man mightyof valour and of his fathers house twenty and two captains and of the children of benjamin the kindred of saul threethousand for hitherto the greatest part of them had kept the ward ofthe house of saul and of the children of ephraim twenty thousand and eighthundred mighty men of valour famous throughout the house of theirfathers and of the half tribe of manasseh eighteen thousand which wereexpressed by name to come and make david king and of the children of issachar which were men that hadunderstanding of the times to know what israel ought to do the headsof them were two hundred and all their brethren were at theircommandment of zebulun such as went forth to battle expert in war withall instruments of war fifty thousand which could keep rank theywere not of double heart and of naphtali a thousand captains and with them with shieldand spear thirty and seven thousand and of the danites expert in war twenty and eight thousand andsix hundred and of asher such as went forth to battle expert in war fortythousand and on the other side of jordan of the reubenites and thegadites and of the half tribe of manasseh with all manner ofinstruments of war for the battle an hundred and twenty thousand all these men of war that could keep rank came with a perfectheart to hebron to make david king over all israel and all the restalso of israel were of one heart to make david king and there they were with david three days eating and drinkingfor their brethren had prepared for them moreover they that were nigh them even unto issachar andzebulun and naphtali brought bread on asses and on camels and onmules and on oxen and meat meal cakes of figs and bunches ofraisins and wine and oil and oxen and sheep abundantly for therewas joy in israel and david consulted with the captains of thousands and hundredsand with every leader and david said unto all the congregation of israel if it seemgood unto you and that it be of the lord our god let us send abroadunto our brethren every where that are left in all the land ofisrael and with them also to the priests and levites which are intheir cities and suburbs that they may gather themselves unto us and let us bring again the ark of our god to us for we enquirednot at it in the days of saul and all the congregation said that they would do so for thething was right in the eyes of all the people so david gathered all israel together from shihor of egypt evenunto the entering of hemath to bring the ark of god fromkirjathjearim and david went up and all israel to baalah that is tokirjathjearim which belonged to judah to bring up thence the ark ofgod the lord that dwelleth between the cherubims whose name iscalled on it and they carried the ark of god in a new cart out of the house ofabinadab and uzza and ahio drave the cart and david and all israel played before god with all their mightand with singing and with harps and with psalteries and withtimbrels and with cymbals and with trumpets and when they came unto the threshingfloor of chidon uzza putforth his hand to hold the ark for the oxen stumbled and the anger of the lord was kindled against uzza and he smotehim because he put his hand to the ark and there he died before god and david was displeased because the lord had made a breachupon uzza wherefore that place is called perezuzza to this day and david was afraid of god that day saying how shall i bringthe ark of god home to me   so david brought not the ark home tohimself to the city of david but carried it aside into the house ofobededom the gittite and the ark of god remained with the family of obededom in hishouse three months and the lord blessed the house of obededom andall that he had now hiram king of tyre sent messengers to david and timber ofcedars with masons and carpenters to build him an house and david perceived that the lord had confirmed him king overisrael for his kingdom was lifted up on high because of his peopleisrael and david took more wives at jerusalem and david begat more sonsand daughters now these are the names of his children which he had injerusalem shammua and shobab nathan and solomon  and ibharand elishua and elpalet  and nogah and nepheg and japhia and elishama and beeliada and eliphalet and when the philistines heard that david was anointed king overall israel all the philistines went up to seek david and david heardof it and went out against them and the philistines came and spread themselves in the valley ofrephaim and david enquired of god saying shall i go up against thephilistines and wilt thou deliver them into mine hand and the lordsaid unto him go up for i will deliver them into thine hand so they came up to baalperazim and david smote them there thendavid said god hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like thebreaking forth of waters therefore they called the name of that placebaalperazim and when they had left their gods there david gave acommandment and they were burned with fire and the philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in thevalley therefore david enquired again of god and god said unto him gonot up after them turn away from them and come upon them overagainst the mulberry trees and it shall be when thou shalt hear a sound of going in thetops of the mulberry trees that then thou shalt go out to battle forgod is gone forth before thee to smite the host of the philistines david therefore did as god commanded him and they smote thehost of the philistines from gibeon even to gazer and the fame of david went out into all lands and the lordbrought the fear of him upon all nations and david made him houses in the city of david and prepared aplace for the ark of god and pitched for it a tent then david said none ought to carry the ark of god but thelevites for them hath the lord chosen to carry the ark of god and tominister unto him for ever and david gathered all israel together to jerusalem to bring upthe ark of the lord unto his place which he had prepared for it and david assembled the children of aaron and the levites of the sons of kohath uriel the chief and his brethren an hundredand twenty  of the sons of merari asaiah the chief and hisbrethren two hundred and twenty  of the sons of gershom joel thechief and his brethren an hundred and thirty  of the sons ofelizaphan shemaiah the chief and his brethren two hundred  ofthe sons of hebron eliel the chief and his brethren fourscore of the sons of uzziel amminadab the chief and his brethren anhundred and twelve and david called for zadok and abiathar the priests and for thelevites for uriel asaiah and joel shemaiah and eliel andamminadab  and said unto them ye are the chief of the fathersof the levites sanctify yourselves both ye and your brethren thatye may bring up the ark of the lord god of israel unto the place thati have prepared for it for because ye did it not at the first the lord our god made abreach upon us for that we sought him not after the due order so the priests and the levites sanctified themselves to bring upthe ark of the lord god of israel and the children of the levites bare the ark of god upon theirshoulders with the staves thereon as moses commanded according to theword of the lord and david spake to the chief of the levites to appoint theirbrethren to be the singers with instruments of musick psalteries andharps and cymbals sounding by lifting up the voice with joy so the levites appointed heman the son of joel and of hisbrethren asaph the son of berechiah and of the sons of merari theirbrethren ethan the son of kushaiah  and with them theirbrethren of the second degree zechariah ben and jaaziel andshemiramoth and jehiel and unni eliab and benaiah and maaseiahand mattithiah and elipheleh and mikneiah and obededom and jeielthe porters so the singers heman asaph and ethan were appointed to soundwith cymbals of brass  and zechariah and aziel andshemiramoth and jehiel and unni and eliab and maaseiah andbenaiah with psalteries on alamoth  and mattithiah andelipheleh and mikneiah and obededom and jeiel and azaziah withharps on the sheminith to excel and chenaniah chief of the levites was for song he instructedabout the song because he was skilful and berechiah and elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark and shebaniah and jehoshaphat and nethaneel and amasai andzechariah and benaiah and eliezer the priests did blow with thetrumpets before the ark of god and obededom and jehiah weredoorkeepers for the ark so david and the elders of israel and the captains overthousands went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the lord out ofthe house of obededom with joy and it came to pass when god helped the levites that bare theark of the covenant of the lord that they offered seven bullocks andseven rams and david was clothed with a robe of fine linen and all thelevites that bare the ark and the singers and chenaniah the masterof the song with the singers david also had upon him an ephod oflinen thus all israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the lordwith shouting and with sound of the cornet and with trumpets andwith cymbals making a noise with psalteries and harps and it came to pass as the ark of the covenant of the lord cameto the city of david that michal the daughter of saul looking out ata window saw king david dancing and playing and she despised him inher heart so they brought the ark of god and set it in the midst of thetent that david had pitched for it and they offered burnt sacrificesand peace offerings before god and when david had made an end of offering the burnt offeringsand the peace offerings he blessed the people in the name of thelord and he dealt to every one of israel both man and woman to everyone a loaf of bread and a good piece of flesh and a flagon of wine and he appointed certain of the levites to minister before theark of the lord and to record and to thank and praise the lord godof israel  asaph the chief and next to him zechariah jeiel andshemiramoth and jehiel and mattithiah and eliab and benaiah andobededom and jeiel with psalteries and with harps but asaph made asound with cymbals  benaiah also and jahaziel the priests withtrumpets continually

thanks tothy holy name and glory in thy praise blessed be the lord god of israel for ever and ever and all thepeople said amen and praised the lord so he left there before the ark of the covenant of the lordasaph and his brethren to minister before the ark continually asevery days work required  and obededom with their brethrenthreescore and eight obededom also the son of jeduthun and hosah tobe porters  and zadok the priest and his brethren the priestsbefore the tabernacle of the lord in the high place that was atgibeon  to offer burnt offerings unto the lord upon the altar ofthe burnt offering continually morning and evening and to doaccording to all that is written in the law of the lord which hecommanded israel  and with them heman and jeduthun and the restthat were chosen who were expressed by name to give thanks to thelord because his mercy endureth for ever  and with them hemanand jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should make asound and with musical instruments of god and the sons of jeduthunwere porters and all the people departed every man to his house and davidreturned to bless his house now it came to pass as david sat in his house that david saidto nathan the prophet lo i dwell in an house of cedars but the arkof the covenant of the lord remaineth under curtains then nathan said unto david do all that is in thine heart forgod is with thee and it came to pass the same night that the word of god came tonathan saying  go and tell david my servant thus saith thelord thou shalt not build me an house to dwell in  for i havenot dwelt in an house since the day that i brought up israel unto thisday but have gone from tent to tent and from one tabernacle toanother wheresoever i have walked with all israel spake i a word to anyof the judges of israel whom i commanded to feed my people sayingwhy have ye not built me an house of cedars   now therefore thusshalt thou say unto my servant david thus saith the lord of hosts itook thee from the sheepcote even from following the sheep that thoushouldest be ruler over my people israel  and i have been withthee whithersoever thou hast walked and have cut off all thineenemies from before thee and have made thee a name like the name ofthe great men that are in the earth also i will ordain a place for my people israel and will plantthem and they shall dwell in their place and shall be moved no moreneither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more as atthe beginning  and since the time that i commanded judges to beover my people israel moreover i will subdue all thine enemiesfurthermore i tell thee that the lord will build thee an house and it shall come to pass when thy days be expired that thoumust go to be with thy fathers that i will raise up thy seed afterthee which shall be of thy sons and i will establish his kingdom he shall build me an house and i will stablish his throne forever i will be his father and he shall be my son and i will nottake my mercy away from him as i took it from him that was beforethee  but i will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom forever and his throne shall be established for evermore according to all these words and according to all this visionso did nathan speak unto david and david the king came and sat before the lord and said whoam i o lord god and what is mine house that thou hast brought mehitherto   and yet this was a small thing in thine eyes o godfor thou hast also spoken of thy servants house for a great while tocome and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of highdegree o lord god what can david speak more to thee for the honour of thy servantfor thou knowest thy servant o lord for thy servants sake and according to thine ownheart hast thou done all this greatness in making known all thesegreat things o lord there is none like thee neither is there any god besidethee according to all that we have heard with our ears and what one nation in the earth is like thy people israel whomgod went to redeem to be his own people to make thee a name ofgreatness and terribleness by driving out nations from before thypeople whom thou hast redeemed out of egypt   for thy peopleisrael didst thou make thine own people for ever and thou lordbecamest their god therefore now lord let the thing that thou hast spokenconcerning thy servant and concerning his house be established forever and do as thou hast said let it even be established that thy name may be magnified forever saying the lord of hosts is the god of israel even a god toisrael and let the house of david thy servant be established beforethee for thou o my god hast told thy servant that thou wilt buildhim an house therefore thy servant hath found in his heart to praybefore thee and now lord thou art god and hast promised this goodnessunto thy servant  now therefore let it please thee to bless thehouse of thy servant that it may be before thee for ever for thoublessest o lord and it shall be blessed for ever now after this it came to pass that david smote the philistinesand subdued them and took gath and her towns out of the hand of thephilistines and he smote moab and the moabites became davids servants andbrought gifts and david smote hadarezer king of zobah unto hamath as he wentto stablish his dominion by the river euphrates and david took from him a thousand chariots and seven thousandhorsemen and twenty thousand footmen david also houghed all thechariot horses but reserved of them an hundred chariots and when the syrians of damascus came to help hadarezer king ofzobah david slew of the syrians two and twenty thousand men then david put garrisons in syriadamascus and the syrians becamedavids servants and brought gifts thus the lord preserved davidwhithersoever he went and david took the shields of gold that were on the servants ofhadarezer and brought them to jerusalem likewise from tibhath and from chun cities of hadarezerbrought david very much brass wherewith solomon made the brasen seaand the pillars and the vessels of brass now when tou king of hamath heard how david had smitten all thehost of hadarezer king of zobah  he sent hadoram his son to kingdavid to enquire of his welfare and to congratulate him because hehad fought against hadarezer and smitten him for hadarezer had warwith tou and with him all manner of vessels of gold and silver andbrass them also king david dedicated unto the lord with the silverand the gold that he brought from all these nations from edom andfrom moab and from the children of ammon and from the philistinesand from amalek moreover abishai the son of zeruiah slew of the edomites in thevalley of salt eighteen thousand and he put garrisons in edom and all the edomites becamedavids servants thus the lord preserved david whithersoever he went so david reigned over all israel and executed judgment andjustice among all his people and joab the son of zeruiah was over the host and jehoshaphatthe son of ahilud recorder and zadok the son of ahitub and abimelech the son of abiatharwere the priests and shavsha was scribe  and benaiah the son ofjehoiada was over the cherethites and the pelethites and the sons ofdavid were chief about the king now it came to pass after this that nahash the king of thechildren of ammon died and his son reigned in his stead and david said i will shew kindness unto hanun the son ofnahash because his father shewed kindness to me and david sentmessengers to comfort him concerning his father so the servants ofdavid came into the land of the children of ammon to hanun to comforthim but the princes of the children of ammon said to hanun thinkestthou that david doth honour thy father that he hath sent comfortersunto thee  are not his servants come unto thee for to search and tooverthrow and to spy out the land   wherefore hanun took davidsservants and shaved them and cut off their garments in the midsthard by their buttocks and sent them away then there went certain and told david how the men were servedand he sent to meet them for the men were greatly ashamed and theking said tarry at jericho until your beards be grown and thenreturn and when the children of ammon saw that they had made themselvesodious to david hanun and the children of ammon sent a thousandtalents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out ofmesopotamia and out of syriamaachah and out of zobah so they hired thirty and two thousand chariots and the king ofmaachah and his people who came and pitched before medeba and thechildren of ammon gathered themselves together from their cities andcame to battle and when david heard of it he sent joab and all the host of themighty men and the children of ammon came out and put the battle in arraybefore the gate of the city and the kings that were come were bythemselves in the field now when joab saw that the battle was set against him before andbehind he chose out of all the choice of israel and put them inarray against the syrians and the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of abishaihis brother and they set themselves in array against the children ofammon and he said if the syrians be too strong for me then thoushalt help me but if the children of ammon be too strong for theethen i will help thee be of good courage and let us behave ourselves valiantly forour people and for the cities of our god and let the lord do thatwhich is good in his sight so joab and the people that were with him drew nigh before thesyrians unto the battle and they fled before him and when the children of ammon saw that the syrians were fledthey likewise fled before abishai his brother and entered into thecity then joab came to jerusalem and when the syrians saw that they were put to the worse beforeisrael they sent messengers and drew forth the syrians that werebeyond the river and shophach the captain of the host of hadarezerwent before them and it was told david and he gathered all israel and passedover jordan and came upon them and set the battle in array againstthem so when david had put the battle in array against the syriansthey fought with him but the syrians fled before israel and david slew of thesyrians seven thousand men which fought in chariots and fortythousand footmen and killed shophach the captain of the host and when the servants of hadarezer saw that they were put to theworse before israel they made peace with david and became hisservants neither would the syrians help the children of ammon anymore and it came to pass that after the year was expired at the timethat kings go out to battle joab led forth the power of the army andwasted the country of the children of ammon and came and besiegedrabbah but david tarried at jerusalem and joab smote rabbah anddestroyed it and david took the crown of their king from off his head andfound it to weigh a talent of gold and there were precious stones init and it was set upon davids head and he brought also exceedingmuch spoil out of the city and he brought out the people that were in it and cut them withsaws and with harrows of iron and with axes even so dealt davidwith all the cities of the children of ammon and david and all thepeople returned to jerusalem and it came to pass after this that there arose war at gezerwith the philistines at which time sibbechai the hushathite slewsippai that was of the children of the giant and they were subdued and there was war again with the philistines and elhanan the sonof jair slew lahmi the brother of goliath the gittite whose spearstaff was like a weavers beam and yet again there was war at gath where was a man of greatstature whose fingers and toes were four and twenty six on eachhand and six on each foot and he also was the son of the giant but when he defied israel jonathan the son of shimea davidsbrother slew him these were born unto the giant in gath and they fell by the handof david and by the hand of his servants and satan stood up against israel and provoked david to numberisrael and david said to joab and to the rulers of the people gonumber israel from beersheba even to dan and bring the number of themto me that i may know it and joab answered the lord make his people an hundred times somany more as they be but my lord the king are they not all mylords servants  why then doth my lord require this thing why willhe be a cause of trespass to israel   nevertheless the kingsword prevailed against joab wherefore joab departed and wentthroughout all israel and came to jerusalem and joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto david andall they of israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousandmen that drew sword and judah was four hundred threescore and tenthousand men that drew sword but levi and benjamin counted he not among them for the kingsword was abominable to joab and god was displeased with this thing therefore he smoteisrael and david said unto god i have sinned greatly because i havedone this thing but now i beseech thee do away the iniquity of thyservant for i have done very foolishly and the lord spake unto gad davids seer saying  go andtell david saying thus saith the lord i offer thee three thingschoose thee one of them that i may do it unto thee so gad came to david and said unto him thus saith the lordchoose thee  either three years famine or three months to bedestroyed before thy foes while that the sword of thine enemiesovertaketh thee or else three days the sword of the lord even thepestilence in the land and the angel of the lord destroyingthroughout all the coasts of israel now therefore advise thyself whatword i shall bring again to him that sent me and david said unto gad i am in a great strait let me fall nowinto the hand of the lord for very great are his mercies but let menot fall into the hand of man so the lord sent pestilence upon israel and there fell ofisrael seventy thousand men and god sent an angel unto jerusalem to destroy it and as hewas destroying the lord beheld and he repented him of the evil andsaid to the angel that destroyed it is enough stay now thine handand the angel of the lord stood by the threshingfloor of ornan thejebusite and david lifted up his eyes and saw the angel of the lordstand between the earth and the heaven having a drawn sword in hishand stretched out over jerusalem then david and the elders ofisrael who were clothed in sackcloth fell upon their faces and david said unto god is it not i that commanded the peopleto be numbered even i it is that have sinned and done evil indeedbut as for these sheep what have they done let thine hand i praythee o lord my god be on me and on my fathers house but not onthy people that they should be plagued then the angel of the lord commanded gad to say to david thatdavid should go up and set up an altar unto the lord in thethreshingfloor of ornan the jebusite and david went up at the saying of gad which he spake in thename of the lord and ornan turned back and saw the angel and his four sons withhim hid themselves now ornan was threshing wheat and as david came to ornan ornan looked and saw david and wentout of the threshingfloor and bowed himself to david with his face tothe ground then david said to ornan grant me the place of thisthreshingfloor that i may build an altar therein unto the lord thoushalt grant it me for the full price that the plague may be stayedfrom the people and ornan said unto david take it to thee and let my lord theking do that which is good in his eyes lo i give thee the oxen alsofor burnt offerings and the threshing instruments for wood and thewheat for the meat offering i give it all and king david said to ornan nay but i will verily buy it forthe full price for i will not take that which is thine for the lordnor offer burnt offerings without cost so david gave to ornan for the place six hundred shekels of goldby weight and david built there an altar unto the lord and offered burntofferings and peace offerings and called upon the lord and heanswered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering and the lord commanded the angel and he put up his sword againinto the sheath thereof at that time when david saw that the lord had answered him inthe threshingfloor of ornan the jebusite then he sacrificed there for the tabernacle of the lord which moses made in thewilderness and the altar of the burnt offering were at that seasonin the high place at gibeon but david could not go before it to enquire of god for he wasafraid because of the sword of the angel of the lord then david said this is the house of the lord god and this isthe altar of the burnt offering for israel and david commanded to gather together the strangers that were inthe land of israel and he set masons to hew wrought stones to buildthe house of god and david prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doorsof the gates and for the joinings and brass in abundance withoutweight  also cedar trees in abundance for the zidonians and theyof tyre brought much cedar wood to david and david said solomon my son is young and tender and the housethat is to be builded for the lord must be exceeding magnifical offame and of glory throughout all countries i will therefore now makepreparation for it so david prepared abundantly before his death then he called for solomon his son and charged him to build anhouse for the lord god of israel and david said to solomon my son as for me it was in my mindto build an house unto the name of the lord my god  but the wordof the lord came to me saying thou hast shed blood abundantly andhast made great wars thou shalt not build an house unto my namebecause thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight behold a son shall be born to thee who shall be a man of restand i will give him rest from all his enemies round about for hisname shall be solomon and i will give peace and quietness unto israelin his days he shall build an house for my name and he shall be my son andi will be his father and i will establish the throne of his kingdomover israel for ever now my son the lord be with thee and prosper thou and buildthe house of the lord thy god as he hath said of thee only the lord give thee wisdom and understanding and give theecharge concerning israel that thou mayest keep the law of the lordthy god then shalt thou prosper if thou takest heed to fulfil thestatutes and judgments which the lord charged moses with concerningisrael be strong and of good courage dread not nor be dismayed now behold in my trouble i have prepared for the house of thelord an hundred thousand talents of gold and a thousand thousandtalents of silver and of brass and iron without weight for it is inabundance timber also and stone have i prepared and thou mayest addthereto moreover there are workmen with thee in abundance hewers andworkers of stone and timber and all manner of cunning men for everymanner of work of the gold the silver and the brass and the iron there isno number arise therefore and be doing and the lord be with thee david also commanded all the princes of israel to help solomonhis son saying  is not the lord your god with you and hath henot given you rest on every side for he hath given the inhabitants ofthe land into mine hand and the land is subdued before the lord andbefore his people now set your heart and your soul to seek the lord your godarise therefore and build ye the sanctuary of the lord god to bringthe ark of the covenant of the lord and the holy vessels of god intothe house that is to be built to the name of the lord so when david was old and full of days he made solomon his sonking over israel and he gathered together all the princes of israel with thepriests and the levites now the levites were numbered from the age of thirty years andupward and their number by their polls man by man was thirty andeight thousand of which twenty and four thousand were to set forward the workof the house of the lord and six thousand were officers and judges moreover four thousand were porters and four thousand praisedthe lord with the instruments which i made said david to praisetherewith and david divided them into courses among the sons of levinamely gershon kohath and merari of the gershonites were laadan and shimei the sons of laadan the chief was jehiel and zetham and joelthree the sons of shimei shelomith and haziel and haran threethese were the chief of the fathers of laadan and the sons of shimei were jahath zina and jeush andberiahthese four were the sons of shimei and jahath was the chief and zizah the second but jeush andberiah had not many sons therefore they were in one reckoningaccording to their fathers house the sons of kohath amram izhar hebron and uzziel four the sons of amram aaron and moses and aaron was separatedthat he should sanctify the most holy things he and his sons forever to burn incense before the lord to minister unto him and tobless in his name for ever now concerning moses the man of god his sons were named of thetribe of levi the sons of moses were gershom and eliezer of the sons of gershom shebuel was the chief and the sons of eliezer were rehabiah the chief and eliezerhad none other sons but the sons of rehabiah were very many of the sons of izhar shelomith the chief of the sons of hebron jeriah the first amariah the

the fathers as they were counted by number of namesby their polls that did the work for the service of the house of thelord from the age of twenty years and upward for david said the lord god of israel hath given rest unto hispeople that they may dwell in jerusalem for ever  and also untothe levites they shall no more carry the tabernacle nor any vesselsof it for the service thereof for by the last words of david the levites were numbered fromtwenty years old and above  because their office was to wait onthe sons of aaron for the service of the house of the lord in thecourts and in the chambers and in the purifying of all holy thingsand the work of the service of the house of god  both for theshewbread and for the fine flour for meat offering and for theunleavened cakes and for that which is baked in the pan and for thatwhich is fried and for all manner of measure and size  and tostand every morning to thank and praise the lord and likewise ateven  and to offer all burnt

the tabernacle ofthe congregation and the charge of the holy place and the charge ofthe sons of aaron their brethren in the service of the house of thelord now these are the divisions of the sons of aaron the sons ofaaron nadab and abihu eleazar and ithamar but nadab and abihu died before their father and had nochildren therefore eleazar and ithamar executed the priests office and david distributed them both zadok of the sons of eleazarand ahimelech of the sons of ithamar according to their offices intheir service and there were more chief men found of the sons of eleazar thanof the sons of ithamar and thus were they divided among the sons ofeleazar there were sixteen chief men of the house of their fathersand eight among the sons of ithamar according to the house of theirfathers thus were they divided by lot one sort with another for thegovernors of the sanctuary and governors of the house of god were ofthe sons of eleazar and of the sons of ithamar and shemaiah the son of nethaneel the scribe one of the leviteswrote them before the king and the princes and zadok the priest andahimelech the son of abiathar and before the chief of the fathers ofthe priests and levites

obeyed him and all the princes and the mighty men and all the sonslikewise of king david submitted themselves unto solomon the king and the lord magnified solomon exceedingly in the sight of allisrael and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been onany king before him in israel thus david the son of jesse reigned over all israel and the time that he reigned over israel was forty years sevenyears reigned he in hebron and thirty and three years reigned he injerusalem and he died in a good old age full of days riches and honourand solomon his son reigned in his stead now the acts of david the king first and last behold they arewritten in the book of samuel the seer and in the book of nathan theprophet and in the book of gad the seer  with all his reign andhis might and the times that went over him and over israel and overall the kingdoms of the countriesthe second book of the chronicles and solomon the son of david was strengthened in his kingdom andthe lord his god was with him and magnified him exceedingly then solomon spake unto all israel to the captains of thousandsand of hundreds and to the judges and to every governor in allisrael the chief of the fathers so solomon and all the congregation with him went to the highplace that was at gibeon for there was the tabernacle of thecongregation of god which moses the servant of the lord had made inthe wilderness but the ark of god had david brought up from kirjathjearim to theplace which david had prepared for it for he had pitched a tent forit at jerusalem moreover the brasen altar that bezaleel the son of uri the sonof hur had made he put before the tabernacle of the lord andsolomon and the congregation sought unto it and solomon went up thither to the brasen altar before the lordwhich was at the tabernacle of the congregation and offered athousand burnt offerings upon it in that night did god appear unto solomon and said unto him askwhat i shall give thee and solomon said unto god thou hast shewed great mercy unto davidmy father and hast made me to reign in his stead now o lord god let thy promise unto david my father beestablished for thou hast made me king over a people like the dust ofthe earth in multitude give me now wisdom and knowledge that i may go out and come inbefore this people for who can judge this thy people that is sogreat   and god said to solomon because this was in thine heartand thou hast not asked riches wealth or honour nor the life ofthine enemies neither yet hast asked long life but hast asked wisdomand knowledge for thyself that thou mayest judge my people over whomi have made thee king  wisdom and knowledge is granted unto theeand i will give thee riches and wealth and honour such as none ofthe kings have had that have been before thee neither shall there anyafter thee have the like then solomon came from his journey to the high place that was atgibeon to jerusalem from before the tabernacle of the congregationand reigned over israel and solomon gathered chariots and horsemen and he had a thousandand four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen which heplaced in the chariot cities and with the king at jerusalem and the king made silver and gold at jerusalem as plenteous asstones and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that are in thevale for abundance and solomon had horses brought out of egypt and linen yarn thekings merchants received the linen yarn at a price and they fetched up and brought forth out of egypt a chariot forsix hundred shekels of silver and an horse for an hundred and fiftyand so brought they out horses for all the kings of the hittites andfor the kings of syria by their means and solomon determined to build an house for the name of the lordand an house for his kingdom and solomon told out threescore and ten thousand men to bearburdens and fourscore thousand to hew in the mountain and threethousand and six hundred to oversee them and solomon sent to huram the king of tyre saying as thou didstdeal with david my father and didst send him cedars to build him anhouse to dwell therein even so deal with me behold i build an house to the name of the lord my god todedicate it to him and to burn before him sweet incense and for thecontinual shewbread and for the burnt offerings morning and eveningon the sabbaths and on the new moons and on the solemn feasts of thelord our god this is an ordinance for ever to israel and the house which i build is great for great is our god aboveall gods but who is able to build him an house seeing the heaven andheaven of heavens cannot contain him who am i then that i shouldbuild him an house save only to burn sacrifice before him   sendme now therefore a man cunning to work in gold and in silver and inbrass and in iron and in purple and crimson and blue and that canskill to grave with the cunning men that are with me in judah and injerusalem whom david my father did provide send me also cedar trees fir trees and algum trees out oflebanon for

wonderful great and behold i will give to thy servants the hewers that cuttimber twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat and twenty thousandmeasures of barley and twenty thousand baths of wine and twentythousand baths of oil then huram the king of tyre answered in writing which he sent tosolomon because the lord hath loved his people he hath made theeking over them huram said moreover blessed be the lord god of israel that madeheaven and earth who hath given to david the king a wise son enduedwith prudence and understanding that might build an house for thelord and an house for his kingdom and now i have sent a cunning man endued with understanding ofhuram my fathers  the son of a woman of the daughters of danand his father was a man of tyre skilful to work in gold and insilver in brass in iron in stone and in timber in purple inblue and in fine linen and in crimson also to grave any manner ofgraving and to find out every device which shall be put to him withthy cunning men and with the cunning men of my lord david thy father now therefore the wheat and the barley the oil and the winewhich my lord hath spoken of let him send unto his servants  andwe will cut wood out of lebanon as much as thou shalt need and wewill bring it to thee in floats by sea to joppa and thou shalt carryit up to jerusalem and solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land ofisrael after the

that then the house was filled with a cloud even the houseof the lord  so that the priests could not stand to minister byreason of the cloud for the glory of the lord had filled the house ofgod then said solomon the lord hath said that he would dwell in thethick darkness but i have built an house of habitation for thee and a place forthy dwelling for ever and the king turned his face and blessed the whole congregationof israel and all the congregation of israel stood and he said blessed be the lord god of israel who hath with hishands fulfilled that which he spake with his mouth to my father davidsaying  since the day that i brought forth my people out of theland of egypt i chose no city among all the tribes of israel to buildan house in that my name might be there neither chose i any man tobe a ruler over my people israel  but i have chosen jerusalemthat my name might be there and have chosen david to be over mypeople israel now it was in the heart of david my father to build an house forthe name of the lord god of israel but the lord said to david my father forasmuch as it was in thineheart to build an house for my name thou didst well in that it was inthine heart  notwithstanding thou shalt not build the house butthy son which shall come forth out of thy loins he shall build thehouse for my name the lord therefore hath performed his word that he hath spokenfor i am risen up in the room of david my father and am set on thethrone of israel as the lord promised and have built the house forthe name of the lord god of israel and in it have i put the ark wherein is the covenant of thelord that he made with the children of israel and he stood before the altar of the lord in the presence of allthe congregation of israel and spread forth his hands  forsolomon had made a brasen scaffold of five cubits long and fivecubits broad and three cubits high and had set it in the midst ofthe court and upon it he stood and kneeled down upon his kneesbefore all the congregation of israel and spread forth his handstoward heaven and said o lord god of israel there is no god like thee in theheaven nor in the earth which keepest covenant and shewest mercyunto thy servants that walk

when solomon had made an end of praying the fire came downfrom heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices andthe glory of the lord filled the house and the priests could not enter into the house of the lordbecause the glory of the lord had filled the lords house and when all the children of israel saw how the fire came downand the glory of the lord upon the house they bowed themselves withtheir faces to the ground upon the pavement and worshipped andpraised the lord saying for he is good for his mercy endureth forever then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before thelord and king solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousandoxen and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep so the king and allthe people dedicated the house of god and the priests waited on their offices the levites also withinstruments of musick of the lord which david the king had made topraise the lord because his mercy endureth for ever when davidpraised by their ministry and the priests sounded trumpets beforethem and all israel stood moreover solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was beforethe house of the lord for there he offered burnt offerings and thefat of the peace offerings because the brasen altar which solomon hadmade was not able to receive the burnt offerings and the meatofferings and the fat also at the same time solomon kept the feast seven days and allisrael with him a very great congregation from the entering in ofhamath unto the river of egypt and in the eighth day they made a solemn assembly for they keptthe dedication of the altar seven days and the feast seven days and on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sentthe people away into their tents glad and merry in heart for thegoodness that the lord had shewed unto david and to solomon and toisrael his people thus solomon finished the house of the lord and the kingshouse and all that came into solomons heart to make in the house ofthe lord and in his own house he prosperously effected and the lord appeared to solomon by night and said unto him ihave heard thy prayer and have chosen this place to myself for anhouse of sacrifice if i shut up heaven that there be no rain or if i command thelocusts to devour the land or if i send pestilence among my people if my people which are called by my name shall humblethemselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wickedways then will i hear from heaven and will forgive their sin andwill heal their land now mine eyes shall be open and mine ears attent unto the prayerthat is made in this place for now have i chosen and sanctified this house that my name maybe there for ever and mine eyes and mine heart shall be thereperpetually and as for thee if thou wilt walk before me as david thy fatherwalked and do according to all that i have commanded thee and shaltobserve my statutes and my judgments  then will i stablish thethrone of thy kingdom according as i have covenanted with david thyfather saying there shall not fail thee a man to be ruler in israel but if ye turn away and forsake my statutes and my commandmentswhich i have set before you and shall go and serve other gods andworship them  then will i pluck them up by the roots out of myland which i have given them and this house which i have sanctifiedfor my name will i cast out of my sight and will make it to be aproverb and a byword among all nations and this house which is high shall be an astonishment to everyone that passeth by it so that he shall say why hath the lord donethus unto this land and unto this house   and it shall beanswered because they forsook the lord god of their fathers whichbrought them forth out of the land of egypt and laid hold on othergods and worshipped them and served them therefore hath he broughtall this evil upon them and it came to pass at the end of twenty years wherein solomonhad built the house of the lord and his own house  that thecities which huram had restored to solomon solomon built them andcaused the children of israel to dwell there and solomon went to hamathzobah and prevailed against it and he built tadmor in the wilderness and all the store citieswhich he built in hamath also he built bethhoron the upper and bethhoron the netherfenced cities with walls gates and bars  and baalath and allthe store cities that solomon had and all the chariot cities and thecities of the horsemen and all that solomon desired to build injerusalem and in lebanon and throughout all the land of hisdominion as for all the people that were left of the hittites and theamorites and the perizzites and the hivites and the jebusiteswhich were not of israel  but of their children who were leftafter them in the land whom the children of israel consumed not themdid solomon make to pay tribute until this day but of the children of israel did solomon make no servants for hiswork but they were men of war and chief of his captains andcaptains of his chariots and horsemen and these were the chief of king solomons officers even twohundred and fifty that bare rule over the people and solomon brought up the daughter of pharaoh out of the city ofdavid unto the house that he had built for her for he said my wifeshall not dwell in the house of david king of israel because theplaces are holy whereunto the ark of the lord hath come then solomon offered burnt offerings unto the lord on the altarof the lord which he had built before the porch  even after acertain rate every day offering according to the commandment ofmoses on the sabbaths and on the new moons and on the solemnfeasts three times in the year even in the feast of unleavenedbread and in the feast of weeks and in the feast of tabernacles and he appointed according to the order of david his father thecourses of the priests to their service and the levites to theircharges to praise and minister before the priests as the duty ofevery day required the porters also by their courses at every gatefor so had david the man of god commanded and they departed not from the commandment of the king unto thepriests and levites concerning any matter or concerning thetreasures now all the work of solomon was prepared unto the day of thefoundation of the house of the lord and until it was finished so thehouse of the lord was perfected then went solomon to eziongeber and to eloth at the sea side inthe land of edom and huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships andservants that had knowledge of the sea and they went with theservants of solomon to ophir and took thence four hundred and fiftytalents of gold and brought them to king solomon and when the queen of sheba heard of the fame of solomon she cameto prove solomon with hard questions at jerusalem with a very greatcompany and camels that bare spices and gold in abundance andprecious stones and when she was come to solomon she communed withhim of all that was in her heart and solomon told her all her questions and there was nothing hidfrom solomon which he told her not and when the queen of sheba had seen the wisdom of solomon andthe house that he had built  and the meat of his table and thesitting of his servants and the attendance of his ministers andtheir apparel his cupbearers also and their apparel and his ascentby which he went up into the house of the lord there was no morespirit in her and she said to the king it was a true report which i heard inmine own land of thine acts and of thy wisdom  howbeit i believednot their words until i came and mine eyes had seen it and beholdthe one half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not told me for thouexceedest the fame that i heard happy are thy men and happy are these thy servants which standcontinually before thee and hear thy wisdom blessed be the lord thy god which delighted in thee to set theeon his throne to be king for the lord thy god because thy god lovedisrael to establish them for ever therefore made he thee king overthem to do judgment and justice and she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold andof spices great abundance and precious stones neither was there anysuch spice as the queen of sheba gave king solomon and the servants also of huram and the servants of solomonwhich brought gold from ophir brought algum trees and preciousstones and the king made of the algum trees terraces to the house of thelord and to the kings palace and harps and psalteries for singersand there were none such seen before in the land of judah and king solomon gave to the queen of sheba all her desirewhatsoever she asked beside that which she had brought unto the kingso she turned and went away to her own land she and her servants now the weight of gold that came to solomon in one year was sixhundred and threescore and six talents of gold  beside that whichchapmen and merchants brought and all the kings of arabia andgovernors of the country brought gold and silver to solomon and king solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold sixhundred shekels of beaten gold went to one target and three hundred shields made he of beaten gold three hundredshekels of gold went to one shield and the king put them in the houseof the forest of lebanon moreover the king made a great throne of ivory and overlaid itwith pure gold and there were six steps to the throne with a footstool of goldwhich were fastened to the throne and stays on each side of thesitting place and two lions standing by the stays  and twelvelions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six stepsthere was not the like made in any kingdom and all the drinking vessels of king solomon were of gold andall the vessels of the house of the forest of lebanon were of puregold none were of silver it was not any thing accounted of in thedays of solomon for the kings ships went to tarshish with the servants of huramevery three years once came the ships of tarshish bringing gold andsilver ivory and apes and peacocks and king solomon passed all the kings of the earth in riches andwisdom and all the kings of the earth sought the presence of solomon tohear his wisdom that god had put in his heart and they brought every man his present vessels of silver andvessels of gold and raiment harness and spices horses and mulesa rate year by year and solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots andtwelve thousand horsemen whom he bestowed in the chariot cities andwith the king at jerusalem and he reigned over all the kings from the river even unto theland of the philistines and to the border of egypt and the king made silver in jerusalem as stones and cedar treesmade he as the sycomore trees that are in the low plains in abundance and they brought unto solomon horses out of egypt and out of alllands now the rest of the acts of solomon first and last are they notwritten in the book of nathan the prophet and in the prophecy ofahijah the shilonite and in the visions of iddo the seer againstjeroboam the son of nebat   and solomon reigned in jerusalem overall israel forty years and solomon slept with his fathers and he was buried in the cityof david his father and rehoboam his son reigned in his stead and rehoboam went to shechem for to shechem were all israel cometo make him king and it came to pass when jeroboam the son of nebat who was inegypt whither he fled from the presence of solomon the king heardit that jeroboam returned out of egypt and they sent and called him so jeroboam and all israel came andspake to rehoboam saying  thy father made our yoke grievous nowtherefore ease thou somewhat the grievous servitude of thy father andhis heavy yoke that he put upon us and we will serve thee and he said unto them come again unto me after three days andthe people departed and king rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stoodbefore solomon his father while he yet lived saying what counselgive ye me to return answer to this people   and they spake untohim saying if thou be kind to this people and please them andspeak good words to them they will be thy servants for ever but he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him and tookcounsel with the young men that were brought up with him that stoodbefore him and he said unto them what advice give ye that we may returnanswer to this people which have spoken to me saying ease somewhatthe yoke that thy father did put upon us   and the young menthat were brought up with him spake unto him saying thus shalt thouanswer the people that spake unto thee saying thy father made ouryoke heavy but make thou it somewhat lighter for us thus shalt thousay unto them my little finger shall be thicker than my fathersloins for whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you i will put moreto your yoke my father chastised you with whips but i will chastiseyou with scorpions so jeroboam and all the people came to rehoboam on the thirdday as the king bade saying come again to me on the third day and the king answered them roughly and king rehoboam forsookthe counsel of the old men  and answered them after the adviceof the young men saying my father made your yoke heavy but i willadd thereto my father chastised you with whips but i will chastiseyou with scorpions so the king hearkened not unto the people for the cause was ofgod that the lord might perform his word which he spake by the handof ahijah the shilonite to jeroboam the son of nebat and when all israel saw that the king would not hearken untothem the people answered the king saying what portion have we indavid  and we have none inheritance in the son of jesse every man toyour tents o israel and now david see to thine own house so allisrael went to their tents but as for the children of israel that dwelt in the cities ofjudah rehoboam reigned over them then king rehoboam sent hadoram that was over the tribute andthe children of israel stoned him with stones that he died but kingrehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot to flee tojerusalem and israel rebelled against the house of david unto this day and when rehoboam was come to jerusalem he gathered of the houseof judah and benjamin an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen menwhich were warriors to fight against israel that he might bring thekingdom again to rehoboam but the word of the lord came to shemaiah the man of god saying speak unto rehoboam the son of solomon king of judah and to allisrael in judah and benjamin saying  thus saith the lord yeshall not go up nor fight against your brethren return every man tohis house for this thing is done of me and they obeyed the words ofthe lord and returned from going against jeroboam and rehoboam dwelt in jerusalem and built cities for defence injudah he built even bethlehem and etam and tekoa  and bethzurand shoco and adullam  and gath and mareshah and ziph and adoraim and lachish and azekah  and zorah and aijalonand hebron which are in judah and in benjamin fenced cities and he fortified the strong holds and put captains in them andstore of victual and of oil and wine and in every several city he put shields and spears and madethem exceeding strong having judah and benjamin on his side and the priests and the levites that were in all israel resortedto him out of all their coasts for the levites left their suburbs and their possession andcame to judah and jerusalem for jeroboam and his sons had cast themoff from executing the priests office unto the lord  and heordained him priests for the high places and for the devils and forthe calves which he had made and after them out of all the tribes of israel such as set theirhearts to seek the lord god of israel came to jerusalem to sacrificeunto the lord god of their fathers so they strengthened the kingdom of judah and made rehoboam theson of solomon strong three years for three years they walked in theway of david and solomon and rehoboam took him mahalath the daughter of jerimoth the sonof david to wife and abihail the daughter of eliab the son of jesse which bare him children jeush and shamariah and zaham and after her he took maachah the daughter of absalom whichbare him abijah and attai and ziza and shelomith and rehoboam loved maachah the daughter of absalom above all hiswives and his concubines for he took eighteen wives and threescoreconcubines and begat twenty and eight sons and threescoredaughters   and rehoboam made abijah the son of maachah thechief to be ruler among his brethren for he thought to make himking and he dealt wisely and dispersed of all his childrenthroughout all the countries of judah and benjamin unto every fencedcity and he gave them victual in abundance and he desired manywives and it came to pass when rehoboam had established the kingdomand had strengthened himself he forsook the law of the lord and allisrael with him and it came to pass that in the fifth year of king rehoboamshishak king of egypt came up against jerusalem because they hadtransgressed against the lord  with twelve hundred chariots andthreescore thousand horsemen and the people were without number thatcame with him out of egypt the lubims the sukkiims and theethiopians and he took the fenced cities which pertained to judah and cameto jerusalem then came shemaiah the prophet to rehoboam and to the princes ofjudah that were gathered together to jerusalem because of shishakand said unto them thus saith the lord ye have forsaken me andtherefore have i also left you in the hand of shishak whereupon the princes of israel and the king humbled themselvesand they said the lord is righteous and when the lord saw that they humbled themselves the word ofthe lord came to shemaiah saying they have humbled themselvestherefore i will not destroy them but i will grant them somedeliverance and my wrath shall not be poured out upon jerusalem bythe hand of shishak nevertheless they shall be his servants that they may know myservice and the service of the kingdoms of the countries so shishak king of egypt came up against jerusalem and took awaythe treasures of the house of the lord and the treasures of thekings house he took all he carried away also the shields of goldwhich solomon had made instead of which king rehoboam made shields of brass andcommitted them to the hands of the chief of the guard that kept theentrance of the kings house and when the king entered into the house of the lord the guardcame and fetched them and brought them again into the guard chamber and when he humbled himself the wrath of the lord turned fromhim that he would not destroy him altogether and also in judahthings went well so king rehoboam strengthened himself in jerusalem and reignedfor rehoboam was one and forty years old when he began to reign andhe reigned seventeen years in jerusalem the city which the lord hadchosen out of all the tribes of israel to put his name there and hismothers name was naamah an ammonitess and he did evil because he prepared not his heart to seek thelord now the acts of rehoboam first and last are they not writtenin the book of shemaiah the prophet and of iddo the seer concerninggenealogies and there were wars between rehoboam and jeroboamcontinually and rehoboam slept with his fathers and was buried in the cityof david and abijah his son reigned in his stead now in the eighteenth year of king jeroboam began abijah to reignover judah he reigned three years in jerusalem his mothers name also wasmichaiah the daughter of uriel of gibeah and there was war betweenabijah and jeroboam and abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men ofwar even four hundred thousand chosen men jeroboam also set thebattle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen menbeing mighty men of valour and abijah stood up upon mount zemaraim which is in mountephraim and said hear me thou jeroboam and all israel  oughtye not to know that the lord god of israel gave the kingdom overisrael to david for ever even to him and to his sons by a covenant ofsalt   yet jeroboam the son of nebat the servant of solomon theson of david is risen up and hath rebelled against his lord and there are gathered unto him vain men the children of belialand have strengthened themselves against rehoboam the son of solomonwhen rehoboam was young and tenderhearted and could not withstandthem and now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the lord in the handof the sons of david and ye be a great multitude and there are withyour golden calves which jeroboam made you for gods have ye not cast out the priests of the lord the sons of aaronand the levites and have made you priests after the manner of thenations of other lands so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himselfwith a young bullock and seven rams the same may be a priest of themthat are no gods but as for us the lord is our god and we have not forsakenhim and the priests which minister unto the lord are the sons ofaaron and the levites wait upon their business  and they burnunto the lord every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices andsweet incense the shewbread also set they in order upon the puretable and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof to burnevery evening for we keep the charge of the lord our god but ye haveforsaken him and behold god himself is with us for our captain and hispriests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you o children ofisrael fight ye not against the lord god of your fathers for yeshall not prosper but jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them sothey were before judah and the ambushment was behind them and when judah looked back behold the battle was before andbehind and they cried unto the lord and the priests sounded with thetrumpets then the men of judah gave a shout and as the men of judahshouted it came to pass that god smote jeroboam and all israelbefore abijah and judah and the children of israel fled before judah and god deliveredthem into their hand and abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter sothere fell down slain of israel five hundred thousand chosen men thus the children of israel were brought under at that time andthe children of judah prevailed because they relied upon the lord godof their fathers and abijah pursued after jeroboam and took cities from himbethel with the towns thereof and jeshanah with the towns thereofand ephraim with the towns thereof neither did jeroboam recover strength again in the days ofabijah and the lord struck him and he died but abijah waxed mighty and married fourteen wives and begattwenty and two sons and sixteen daughters and the rest of the acts of abijah and his ways and hissayings are written in the story of the prophet iddo so abijah slept with his fathers and they buried him in the cityof david and asa his son reigned in his stead in his days the landwas quiet ten years and asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the lordhis god  for he took away the altars of the strange gods and thehigh places and brake down the images and cut down the groves and commanded judah to seek the lord god of their fathers and to dothe law and the commandment also he took away out of all the cities of judah the high placesand the images and the kingdom was quiet before him and he built fenced cities in judah for the land had rest andhe had no war in those years because the lord had given him rest therefore he said unto judah let us build these cities and makeabout them walls and towers gates and bars while the land is yetbefore us because we have sought the lord our god we have soughthim and he hath given us rest on every side so they built andprospered and asa had an army of men that bare targets and spears out ofjudah three hundred thousand and out of benjamin that bare shieldsand drew bows two hundred and fourscore thousand all these weremighty men of valour and there came out against them zerah the ethiopian with an hostof a thousand thousand and three hundred chariots and came untomareshah then asa went out against him and they set the battle in arrayin the valley of zephathah at mareshah and asa cried unto the lord his god and said lord it isnothing with thee to help whether with many or with them that haveno power help us o lord our god for we rest on thee and in thyname we go against this multitude o lord thou art our god let noman prevail against thee so the lord smote the ethiopians before asa and before judahand the ethiopians fled and asa and the people that were with him pursued them untogerar and the ethiopians were overthrown that they could not recoverthemselves for they were destroyed before the lord and before hishost and they carried away very much spoil and they smote all the cities round about gerar for the fear ofthe lord came upon them and they spoiled all the cities for therewas exceeding much spoil in them they smote also the tents of cattle and carried away sheep andcamels in abundance and returned to jerusalem and the spirit of god came upon azariah the son of oded  andhe went out to meet asa and said unto him hear ye me asa and alljudah and benjamin the lord is with you while ye be with him and ifye seek him he will be found of you but if ye forsake him he willforsake you now for a long season israel hath been without the true god andwithout a teaching priest and without law but when they in their trouble did turn unto the lord god ofisrael and sought him he was found of them and in those times there was no peace to him that went out norto him that came in but great vexations were upon all the inhabitantsof the countries and nation was destroyed of nation and city of city for god didvex them with all adversity be ye strong therefore and let not your hands be weak for yourwork shall be rewarded and when asa heard these words and the prophecy of oded theprophet he took courage and put away the abominable idols out of allthe land of judah and benjamin and out of the cities which he hadtaken from mount ephraim and renewed the altar of the lord that wasbefore the porch of the lord and he gathered all judah and benjamin and the strangers withthem out of ephraim and manasseh and out of simeon for they fell tohim out of israel in abundance when they saw that the lord his godwas with him so they gathered themselves together at jerusalem in the thirdmonth in the fifteenth year of the reign of asa and they offered unto the lord the same time of the spoil whichthey had brought seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep and they entered into a covenant to seek the lord god of theirfathers with all their heart and with all their soul  thatwhosoever would not seek the lord god of israel should be put todeath whether small or great whether man or woman and they sware unto the lord with a loud voice and withshouting and with trumpets and with cornets and all judah rejoiced at the oath for they had sworn with alltheir heart and sought him with their whole desire and he was foundof them and the lord gave them rest round about and also concerning maachah the mother of asa the king heremoved her from being queen because she had made an idol in a groveand asa cut down her idol and stamped it and burnt it at the brookkidron but the high places were not taken away out of israelnevertheless the heart of asa was perfect all his days and he brought into the house of god the things that his fatherhad dedicated and that he himself had dedicated silver and goldand vessels and there was no more war unto the five and thirtieth year ofthe reign of asa in the six and thirtieth year of the reign of asa baasha king ofisrael came up against judah and built ramah to the intent that hemight let none go out or come in to asa king of judah then asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of thehouse of the lord and of the kings house and sent to benhadad kingof syria that dwelt at damascus saying  there is a leaguebetween me and thee as there was between my father and thy fatherbehold i have sent thee silver and gold go break thy league withbaasha king of israel that he may depart from me and benhadad hearkened unto king asa and sent the captains ofhis armies against the cities of israel and they smote ijon and danand abelmaim and all the store cities of naphtali and it came to pass when baasha heard it that he left offbuilding of ramah and let his work cease then asa the king took all judah and they carried away thestones of ramah and the timber thereof wherewith baasha wasbuilding and he built therewith geba and mizpah and at that time hanani the seer came to asa king of judah andsaid unto him because thou hast relied on the king of syria and notrelied on the lord thy god therefore is the host of the king of syriaescaped out of thine hand were not the ethiopians and the lubims a huge host with verymany chariots and horsemen yet because thou didst rely on the lordhe delivered them into thine hand for the eyes of the lord run to and fro throughout the wholeearth to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart isperfect toward him herein thou hast done foolishly therefore fromhenceforth thou shalt have wars then asa was wroth with the seer and put him in a prison housefor he was in a rage with him because of this thing and asa oppressedsome of the people the same time and behold the acts of asa first and last lo they arewritten in the book of the kings of judah and israel and asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseasedin his feet until his disease was exceeding great yet in his diseasehe sought not to the lord but to the physicians and asa slept with his fathers and died in the one and fortiethyear of his reign and they buried him in his own sepulchres which he had made forhimself in the city of david and laid him in the bed which was filledwith sweet odours and divers kinds of spices prepared by theapothecaries art and they made a very great burning for him and jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead and strengthenedhimself against israel and he placed forces in all the fenced cities of judah and setgarrisons in the land of judah and in the cities of ephraim whichasa his father had taken and the lord was with jehoshaphat because he walked in the firstways of his father david and sought not unto baalim  but soughtto the lord god of his father and walked in his commandments and notafter the doings of israel therefore the lord stablished the kingdom in his hand and alljudah brought to jehoshaphat presents and he had riches and honour inabundance and his heart was lifted up in the ways of the lord moreover hetook away the high places and groves out of judah also in the third year of his reign he sent to his princes evento benhail and to obadiah and to zechariah and to nethaneel and tomichaiah to teach in the cities of judah and with them he sent levites even shemaiah and nethaniah andzebadiah and asahel and shemiramoth and jehonathan and adonijahand tobijah and tobadonijah levites and with them elishama andjehoram priests and they taught in judah and had the book of the law of the lordwith them and went about throughout all the cities of judah andtaught the people and the fear of the lord fell upon all the kingdoms of the landsthat were round about judah so that they made no war againstjehoshaphat also some of the philistines brought jehoshaphat presents andtribute silver and the arabians brought him flocks seven thousandand seven hundred rams and seven thousand and seven hundred he goats and jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly and he built in judahcastles and cities of store and he had much business in the cities of judah and the men ofwar mighty men of valour were in jerusalem and these are the numbers of them according to the house oftheir fathers of judah the captains of thousands adnah the chiefand with him mighty men of valour three hundred thousand and next to him was jehohanan the captain and with him twohundred and fourscore thousand and next him was amasiah the son of zichri who willinglyoffered himself unto the lord and with him two hundred thousandmighty men of valour and of benjamin eliada a mighty man of valour and with himarmed men with bow and shield two hundred thousand and next him was jehozabad and with him an hundred andfourscore thousand ready prepared for the war these waited on the king beside those whom the king put in thefenced cities throughout all judah now jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance and joinedaffinity with ahab and after certain years he went down to ahab to samaria and ahabkilled sheep and oxen for him in abundance and for the people that hehad with him and persuaded him to go up with him to ramothgilead and ahab king of israel said unto jehoshaphat king of judah wiltthou go with me to ramothgilead and he answered him i am as thouart and my people as thy people and we will be with thee in the war and jehoshaphat said unto the king of israel enquire i praythee at the word of the lord to day therefore the king of israel gathered together of prophets fourhundred men and said unto them shall we go to ramothgilead tobattle or shall i forbear and they said go up for god will deliverit into the kings hand but jehoshaphat said is there not here a prophet of the lordbesides that we might enquire of him   and the king of israelsaid unto jehoshaphat there is yet one man by whom we may enquire ofthe lord but i hate him for he never prophesied good unto me butalways evil the same is micaiah the son of imla and jehoshaphatsaid let not the king say so and the king of israel called for one of his officers and saidfetch quickly micaiah the son of imla and the king of israel and jehoshaphat king of judah sat eitherof them on his throne clothed in their robes and they sat in a voidplace at the entering in of the gate of samaria and all the prophetsprophesied before them and zedekiah the son of chenaanah had made him horns of ironand said thus saith the lord with these thou shalt push syria untilthey be consumed and all the prophets prophesied so saying go up toramothgilead and prosper for the lord shall deliver it into the handof the king and the messenger that went to call micaiah spake to himsaying behold the words of the prophets declare good to the kingwith one assent let thy word therefore i pray thee be like one oftheirs and speak thou good and micaiah said as the lord liveth even what my god saiththat will i speak and when he was come to the king the king said unto himmicaiah shall we go to ramothgilead to battle or shall i forbearand he said go ye up and prosper and they shall be delivered intoyour hand and the king said to him how many times shall i adjure theethat thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the lord then he said i did see all israel scattered upon the mountainsas sheep that have no shepherd and the lord said these have nomaster let them return therefore every man to his house in peace and the king of israel said to jehoshaphat did i not tell theethat he would not prophesy good unto me but evil   again hesaid therefore hear the word of the lord i saw the lord sitting uponhis throne and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand andon his left and the lord said who shall entice ahab king of israel that hemay go up and fall at ramothgilead and one spake saying after thismanner and another saying after that manner then there came out a spirit and stood before the lord andsaid i will entice him and the lord said unto him wherewith  and he said i will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouth of allhis prophets and the lord said thou shalt entice him and thou shaltalso prevail go out and do even so now therefore behold the lord hath put a lying spirit in themouth of these thy prophets and the lord hath spoken evil againstthee then zedekiah the son of chenaanah came near and smote micaiahupon the cheek and said which way went the spirit of the lord fromme to speak unto thee   and micaiah said behold thou shalt seeon that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself then the king of israel said take ye micaiah and carry himback to amon the governor of the city and to joash the kings son and say thus saith the king put this fellow in the prison andfeed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction untili return in peace and micaiah said if thou certainly return in peace then hathnot the lord spoken by me and he said hearken all ye people so the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah went upto ramothgilead and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat i will disguisemyself and i will go to the battle but put thou on thy robes so theking of israel disguised himself and they went to the battle now the king of syria had commanded the captains of the chariotsthat were with him saying fight ye not with small or great saveonly with the king of israel and it came to pass when the captains of the chariots sawjehoshaphat that they said it is the king of israel therefore theycompassed about him to fight but jehoshaphat cried out and the lordhelped him and god moved them to depart from him for it came to pass that when the captains of the chariotsperceived that it was not the king of israel they turned back againfrom pursuing him and a certain man drew a bow at a venture and smote the king ofisrael between the joints of the harness therefore he said to hischariot man turn thine hand that thou mayest carry me out of thehost for i am wounded and the battle increased that day howbeit the king of israelstayed himself up in his chariot against the syrians until the evenand about the time of the sun going down he died and jehoshaphat the king of judah returned to his house in peaceto jerusalem and jehu the son of hanani the seer went out to meet him andsaid to king jehoshaphat shouldest thou help the ungodly and lovethem that hate the lord therefore is wrath upon thee from before thelord nevertheless there are good things found in thee in that thouhast taken away the groves out of the land and hast prepared thineheart to seek god and jehoshaphat dwelt at jerusalem and he went out again throughthe people from beersheba to mount ephraim and brought them back untothe lord god of their fathers and he set judges in the land throughout all the fenced cities ofjudah city by city  and said to the judges take heed what yedo for ye judge not for man but for the lord who is with you in thejudgment wherefore now let the fear of the lord be upon you take heed anddo it for there is no iniquity with the lord our god nor respect ofpersons nor taking of gifts moreover in jerusalem did jehoshaphat set of the levites and ofthe priests and of the chief of the fathers of israel for thejudgment of the lord and for controversies when they returned tojerusalem and he charged them saying thus shall ye do in the fear of thelord faithfully and with a perfect heart and what cause soever shall come to you of your brethren thatdwell in your cities between blood and blood between law andcommandment statutes and judgments ye shall even warn them that theytrespass not against the lord and so wrath come upon you and uponyour brethren this do and ye shall not trespass and behold amariah the chief priest is over you in all mattersof the lord and zebadiah the son of ishmael the ruler of the houseof judah for all the kings matters also the levites shall beofficers before you deal courageously and the lord shall be with thegood it came to pass after this also that the children of moab andthe children of ammon and with them other beside the ammonites cameagainst jehoshaphat to battle then there came some that told jehoshaphat saying there cometha great multitude against thee from beyond the sea on this side syriaand behold they be in hazazontamar which is engedi and jehoshaphat feared and set himself to seek the lord andproclaimed a fast throughout all judah and judah gathered themselves together to ask help of the lordeven out of all the cities of judah they came to seek the lord and jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of judah and jerusalemin the house of the lord before the new court  and said o lordgod of our fathers art not thou god in heaven and rulest not thouover all the kingdoms of the heathen and in thine hand is there notpower and might so that none is able to withstand thee   art notthou our god who didst drive out the inhabitants of this land beforethy people israel and gavest it to the seed of abraham thy friend forever   and they dwelt therein and have built thee a sanctuarytherein for thy name saying  if when evil cometh upon us asthe sword judgment or pestilence or famine we stand before thishouse and in thy presence for thy name is in this house and cryunto thee in our affliction then thou wilt hear and help and now behold the children of ammon and moab and mount seirwhom thou wouldest not let israel invade when they came out of theland of egypt but they turned from them and destroyed them not behold i say how they reward us to come to cast us out of thypossession which thou hast given us to inherit o our god wilt thou not judge them for we have no mightagainst this great company that cometh against us neither know wewhat to do but our eyes are upon thee and all judah stood before the lord with their little onestheir wives and their children then upon jahaziel the son of zechariah the son of benaiah theson of jeiel the son of mattaniah a levite of the sons of asaphcame the spirit of the lord in the midst of the congregation and he said hearken ye all judah and ye inhabitants of jerusalemand thou king jehoshaphat thus saith the lord unto you be not afraidnor dismayed by reason of this great multitude for the battle is notyours but gods to morrow go ye down against them behold they come up by thecliff of ziz and ye shall find them at the end of the brook beforethe wilderness of jeruel ye shall not need to fight in this battle set yourselves standye still and see the salvation of the lord with you o judah andjerusalem fear not nor be dismayed to morrow go out against themfor the lord will be with you and jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground andall judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem fell before the lordworshipping the lord and the levites of the children of the kohathites and of thechildren of the korhites stood up to praise the lord god of israelwith a loud voice on high and they rose early in the morning and went forth into thewilderness of tekoa and as they went forth jehoshaphat stood andsaid hear me o judah and ye inhabitants of jerusalem believe inthe lord your god so shall ye be established believe his prophetsso shall ye prosper and when he had consulted with the people he appointed singersunto the lord and that should praise the beauty of holiness as theywent out before the army and to say praise the lord for his mercyendureth for ever and when they began to sing and to praise the lord setambushments against the children of ammon moab and mount seir whichwere come against judah and they were smitten for the children of ammon and moab stood up against theinhabitants of mount seir utterly to slay and destroy them and whenthey had made an end of the inhabitants of seir every one helped todestroy another and when judah came toward the watch tower in the wildernessthey looked unto the multitude and behold they were dead bodiesfallen to the earth and none escaped and when jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoilof them they found among them in abundance both riches with the deadbodies and precious jewels which they stripped off for themselvesmore than they could carry away and they were three days in gatheringof the spoil it was so much and on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley ofberachah for there they blessed the lord therefore the name of thesame place was called the valley of berachah unto this day then they returned every man of judah and jerusalem andjehoshaphat in the forefront of them to go again to jerusalem withjoy for the lord had made them to rejoice over their enemies and they came to jerusalem with psalteries and harps andtrumpets unto the house of the lord and the fear of god was on all the kingdoms of those countrieswhen they had heard that the lord fought against the enemies ofisrael so the realm of jehoshaphat was quiet for his god gave him restround about and jehoshaphat reigned over judah he was thirty and five yearsold when he began to reign and he reigned twenty and five years injerusalemand his mothers name was azubah the daughter of shilhi and he walked in the way of asa his father and departed notfrom it doing that which was right in the sight of the lord howbeit the high places were not taken away for as yet thepeople had not prepared their hearts unto the god of their fathers now the rest of the acts of jehoshaphat first and last beholdthey are written in the book of jehu the son of hanani who ismentioned in the book of the kings of israel and after this did jehoshaphat king of judah join himself withahaziah king of israel who did very wickedly  and he joinedhimself with him to make ships to go to tarshish and they made theships in eziongaber then eliezer the son of dodavah of mareshah prophesied againstjehoshaphat saying because thou hast joined thyself with ahaziahthe lord hath broken thy works and the ships were broken that theywere not able to go to tarshish now jehoshaphat slept with his fathers and was buried with hisfathers in the city of david and jehoram his son reigned in hisstead and he had brethren the sons of jehoshaphat azariah and jehieland zechariah and azariah and michael and shephatiah all thesewere the sons of jehoshaphat king of israel and their father gave them great gifts of silver and of goldand of precious things with fenced cities in judah but the kingdomgave he to jehoram because he was the firstborn now when jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of his father hestrengthened himself and slew all his brethren with the sword anddivers also of the princes of israel jehoram was thirty and two years old when he began to reign andhe reigned eight years in jerusalem and he walked in the way of the kings of israel like as did thehouse of ahab for he had the daughter of ahab to wife and he wroughtthat which was evil in the eyes of the lord howbeit the lord would not destroy the house of david because ofthe covenant that he had made with david and as he promised to give alight to him and to his sons for ever in his days the edomites revolted from under the dominion ofjudah and made themselves a king then jehoram went forth with his princes and all his chariotswith him and he rose up by night and smote the edomites whichcompassed him in and the captains of the chariots so the edomites revolted from under the hand of judah unto thisdaythe same time also did libnah revolt from under his hand because hehad forsaken the lord god of his fathers moreover he made high places in the mountains of judah andcaused the inhabitants of jerusalem to commit fornication andcompelled judah thereto and there came a writing to him from elijah the prophet sayingthus saith the lord god of david thy father because thou hast notwalked in the ways of jehoshaphat thy father nor in the ways of asaking of judah  but hast walked in the way of the kings ofisrael and hast made judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem to go awhoring like to the whoredoms of the house of ahab and also hastslain thy brethren of thy fathers house which were better thanthyself  behold with a great plague will the lord smite thypeople and thy children and thy wives and all thy goods  andthou shalt have great sickness by disease of thy bowels until thybowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by day moreover the lord stirred up against jehoram the spirit of thephilistines and of the arabians that were near the ethiopians and they came up into judah and brake into it and carried away allthe substance that was found in the kings house and his sons alsoand his wives so that there was never a son left him save jehoahazthe youngest of his sons and after all this the lord smote him in his bowels with anincurable disease and it came to pass that in process of time after the end oftwo years his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness so he diedof sore diseases and his people made no burning for him like theburning of his fathers thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign and hereigned in jerusalem eight years and departed without being desiredhowbeit they buried him in the city of david but not in thesepulchres of the kings and the inhabitants of jerusalem made ahaziah his youngest sonking in his stead for the band of men that came with the arabians tothe camp had slain all the eldest so ahaziah the son of jehoram kingof judah reigned forty and two years old was ahaziah when he began to reign andhe reigned one year in jerusalem his mothers name also was athaliahthe daughter of omri he also walked in the ways of the house of ahab for his motherwas his counsellor to do wickedly wherefore he did evil in the sight of the lord like the house ofahab for they were his counsellors after the death of his father tohis destruction he walked also after their counsel and went with jehoram the sonof ahab king of israel to war against hazael king of syria atramothgilead and the syrians smote joram and he returned to be healed in jezreel because of the woundswhich were given him at ramah when he fought with hazael king ofsyria and azariah the son of jehoram king of judah went down to seejehoram the son of ahab at jezreel because he was sick and the destruction of ahaziah was of god by coming to joram forwhen he was come he went out with jehoram against jehu the son ofnimshi whom the lord had anointed to cut off the house of ahab and it came to pass that when jehu was executing judgment uponthe house of ahab and found the princes of judah and the sons of thebrethren of ahaziah that ministered to ahaziah he slew them and he sought ahaziah and they caught him for he was hid insamaria and brought him to jehu and when they had slain him theyburied him because said they he is the son of jehoshaphat whosought the lord with all his heart so the house of ahaziah had nopower to keep still the kingdom but when athaliah the mother of ahaziah saw that her son wasdead she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house ofjudah but jehoshabeath the daughter of the king took joash the sonof ahaziah and stole him from among the kings sons that were slainand put him and his nurse in a bedchamber so jehoshabeath thedaughter of king jehoram the wife of jehoiada the priest for shewas the sister of ahaziah hid him from athaliah so that she slewhim not and he was with them hid in the house of god six years andathaliah reigned over the land and in the seventh year jehoiada strengthened himself and tookthe captains of hundreds azariah the son of jeroham and ishmael theson of jehohanan and azariah the son of obed and maaseiah the son ofadaiah and elishaphat the son of zichri into covenant with him and they went about in judah and gathered the levites out of allthe cities of judah and the chief of the fathers of israel and theycame to jerusalem and all the congregation made a covenant with the king in thehouse of god and he said unto them behold the kings son shallreign as the lord hath said of the sons of david this is the thing that ye shall do a third part of you enteringon the sabbath of the priests and of the levites shall be porters ofthe doors  and a third part shall be at the kings house and athird part at the gate of the foundation and all the people shall bein the courts of the house of the lord but let none come into the house of the lord save the priestsand they that minister of the levites they shall go in for they areholy but all the people shall keep the watch of the lord and the levites shall compass the king round about every manwith his weapons in his hand and whosoever else cometh into thehouse he shall be put to death but be ye with the king when hecometh in and when he goeth out so the levites and all judah did according to all things thatjehoiada the priest had commanded and took every man his men thatwere to come in on the sabbath with them that were to go out on thesabbath for jehoiada the priest dismissed not the courses moreover jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains ofhundreds spears and bucklers and shields that had been kingdavids which were in the house of god and he set all the people every man having his weapon in hishand from the right side of the temple to the left side of thetemple along by the altar and the temple by the king round about then they brought out the kings son and put upon him thecrown and gave him the testimony and made him king and jehoiada andhis sons anointed him and said god save the king now when athaliah heard the noise of the people running andpraising the king she came to the people into the house of the lord and she looked and behold the king stood at his pillar at theentering in and the princes and the trumpets by the king and all thepeople of the land rejoiced and sounded with trumpets also thesingers with instruments of musick and such as taught to sing praisethen athaliah rent her clothes and said treason treason then jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundredsthat were set over the host and said unto them have her forth of theranges and whoso followeth her let him be slain with the sword forthe priest said slay her not in the house of the lord so they laid hands on her and when she was come to the enteringof the horse gate by the kings house they slew her there and jehoiada made a covenant between him and between all thepeople and between the king that they should be the lords people then all the people went to the house of baal and brake itdown and brake his altars and his images in pieces and slew mattanthe priest of baal before the altars also jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the lord bythe hand of the priests the levites whom david had distributed in thehouse of the lord to offer the burnt offerings of the lord as it iswritten in the law of moses with rejoicing and with singing as itwas ordained by david and he set the porters at the gates of the house of the lordthat none which was unclean in any thing should enter in and he took the captains of hundreds and the nobles and thegovernors of the people and all the people of the land and broughtdown the king from the house of the lord and they came through thehigh gate into the kings house and set the king upon the throne ofthe kingdom and all the people of the land rejoiced and the city was quietafter that they had slain athaliah with the sword joash was seven years old when he began to reign and he reignedforty years in jerusalem his mothers name also was zibiah ofbeersheba and joash did that which was right in the sight of the lord allthe days of jehoiada the priest and jehoiada took for him two wives and he begat sons anddaughters and it came to pass after this that joash was minded to repairthe house of the lord and he gathered together the priests and the levites and said tothem go out unto the cities of judah and gather of all israel moneyto repair the house of your god from year to year and see that yehasten the matter howbeit the levites hastened it not and the king called for jehoiada the chief and said unto himwhy hast thou not required of the levites to bring in out of judah andout of jerusalem the collection according to the commandment of mosesthe servant of the lord and of the congregation of israel for thetabernacle of witness   for the sons of athaliah that wickedwoman had broken up the house of god and also all the dedicatedthings of the house of the lord did they bestow upon baalim and at the kings commandment they made a chest and set itwithout at the gate of the house of the lord and they made a proclamation through judah and jerusalem tobring in to the lord the collection that moses the servant of god laidupon israel in the wilderness and all the princes and all the people rejoiced and brought inand cast into the chest until they had made an end now it came to pass that at what time the chest was broughtunto the kings office by the hand of the levites and when they sawthat there was much money the kings scribe and the high priestsofficer came and emptied the chest and took it and carried it to hisplace again thus they did day by day and gathered money inabundance and the king and jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of theservice of the house of the lord and hired masons and carpenters torepair the house of the lord and also such as wrought iron and brassto mend the house of the lord so the workmen wrought and the work was perfected by them andthey set the house of god in his state and strengthened it and when they had finished it they brought the rest of themoney before the king and jehoiada whereof were made vessels for thehouse of the lord even vessels to minister and to offer withal andspoons and vessels of gold and silver and they offered burntofferings in the house of the lord continually all the days ofjehoiada but jehoiada waxed old and was full of days when he died anhundred and thirty years old was he when he died and they buried him in the city of david among the kingsbecause he had done good in israel both toward god and toward hishouse now after the death of jehoiada came the princes of judah andmade obeisance to the king then the king hearkened unto them and they left the house of the lord god of their fathers andserved groves and idols and wrath came upon judah and jerusalem forthis their trespass yet he sent prophets to them to bring them again unto the lordand they testified against them but they would not give ear and the spirit of god came upon zechariah the son of jehoiadathe priest which stood above the people and said unto them thussaith god why transgress ye the commandments of the lord that yecannot prosper because ye have forsaken the lord he hath alsoforsaken you and they conspired against him and stoned him with stones atthe commandment of the king in the court of the house of the lord thus joash the king remembered not the kindness which jehoiadahis father had done to him but slew his son and when he died hesaid the lord look upon it and require it and it came to pass at the end of the year that the host ofsyria came up against him and they came to judah and jerusalem anddestroyed all the princes of the people from among the people andsent all the spoil of them unto the king of damascus for the army of the syrians came with a small company of menand the lord delivered a very great host into their hand because theyhad forsaken the lord god of their fathers so they executed judgmentagainst joash and when they were departed from him for they left him ingreat diseases his own servants conspired against him for the bloodof the sons of jehoiada the priest and slew him on his bed and hedied and they buried him in the city of david but they buried himnot in the sepulchres of the kings and these are they that conspired against him zabad the son ofshimeath an ammonitess and jehozabad the son of shimrith a moabitess now concerning his sons and the greatness of the burdens laidupon him and the repairing of the house of god behold they arewritten in the story of the book of the kings and amaziah his sonreigned in his stead amaziah was twenty and five years old when he began to reign andhe reigned twenty and nine years in jerusalem and his mothers namewas jehoaddan of jerusalem and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord but notwith a perfect heart now it came to pass when the kingdom was established to himthat he slew his servants that had killed the king his father but he slew not their children but did as it is written in thelaw in the book of moses where the lord commanded saying thefathers shall not die for the children neither shall the children diefor the fathers but every man shall die for his own sin moreover amaziah gathered judah together and made them captainsover thousands and captains over hundreds according to the houses oftheir fathers throughout all judah and benjamin and he numbered themfrom twenty years old and above and found them three hundred thousandchoice men able to go forth to war that could handle spear andshield he hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour out ofisrael for an hundred talents of silver but there came a man of god to him saying o king let not thearmy of israel go with thee for the lord is not with israel to witwith all the children of ephraim but if thou wilt go do it be strong for the battle god shallmake thee fall before the enemy for god hath power to help and tocast down and amaziah said to the man of god but what shall we do for thehundred talents which i have given to the army of israel and the manof god answered the lord is able to give thee much more than this then amaziah separated them to wit the army that was come tohim out of ephraim to go home again wherefore their anger wasgreatly kindled against judah and they returned home in great anger and amaziah strengthened himself and led forth his people andwent to the valley of salt and smote of the children of seir tenthousand and other ten thousand left alive did the children of judahcarry away captive and brought them unto the top of the rock andcast them down from the top of the rock that they all were broken inpieces but the soldiers of the army which amaziah sent back that theyshould not go with him to battle fell upon the cities of judah fromsamaria even unto bethhoron and smote three thousand of them andtook much spoil now it came to pass after that amaziah was come from theslaughter of the edomites that he brought the gods of the children ofseir and set them up to be his gods and bowed down himself beforethem and burned incense unto them wherefore the anger of the lord was kindled against amaziah andhe sent unto him a prophet which said unto him why hast thou soughtafter the gods of the people which could not deliver their own peopleout of thine hand   and it came to pass as he talked with himthat the king said unto him art thou made of the kings counselforbear why shouldest thou be smitten then the prophet forbare andsaid i know that god hath determined to destroy thee because thouhast done this and hast not hearkened unto my counsel then amaziah king of judah took advice and sent to joash theson of jehoahaz the son of jehu king of israel saying come let ussee one another in the face and joash king of israel sent to amaziah king of judah sayingthe thistle that was in lebanon sent to the cedar that was in lebanonsaying give thy daughter to my son to wife and there passed by awild beast that was in lebanon and trode down the thistle thou sayest lo thou hast smitten the edomites and thine heartlifteth thee up to boast abide now at home why shouldest thou meddleto thine hurt that thou shouldest fall even thou and judah withthee   but amaziah would not hear for it came of god that hemight deliver them into the hand of their enemies because they soughtafter the gods of edom so joash the king of israel went up and they saw one another inthe face both he and amaziah king of judah at bethshemesh whichbelongeth to judah and judah was put to the worse before israel and they fledevery man to his tent and joash the king of israel took amaziah king of judah the sonof joash the son of jehoahaz at bethshemesh and brought him tojerusalem and brake down the wall of jerusalem from the gate ofephraim to the corner gate four hundred cubits and he took all the gold and the silver and all the vesselsthat were found in the house of god with obededom and the treasuresof the kings house the hostages also and returned to samaria and amaziah the son of joash king of judah lived after the deathof joash son of jehoahaz king of israel fifteen years now the rest of the acts of amaziah first and last behold arethey not written in the book of the kings of judah and israel  now after the time that amaziah did turn away from following the lordthey made a conspiracy against him in jerusalem and he fled tolachish but they sent to lachish after him and slew him there and they brought him upon horses and buried him with hisfathers in the city of judah then all the people of judah took uzziah who was sixteen yearsold and made him king in the room of his father amaziah he built eloth and restored it to judah after that the kingslept with his fathers sixteen years old was uzziah when he began to reign and hereigned fifty and two years in jerusalem his mothers name also wasjecoliah of jerusalem and he did that which was right in the sight of the lordaccording to all that his father amaziah did and he sought god in the days of zechariah who had understandingin the visions of god and as long as he sought the lord god made himto prosper and he went forth and warred against the philistines and brakedown the wall of gath and the wall of jabneh and the wall of ashdodand built cities about ashdod and among the philistines and god helped him against the philistines and against thearabians that dwelt in gurbaal and the mehunims and the ammonites gave gifts to uzziah and his name spreadabroad even to the entering in of egypt for he strengthened himselfexceedingly moreover uzziah built towers in jerusalem at the corner gate andat the valley gate and at the turning of the wall and fortifiedthem also he built towers in the desert and digged many wells forhe had much cattle both in the low country and in the plainshusbandmen also and vine dressers in the mountains and in carmelfor he loved husbandry moreover uzziah had an host of fighting men that went out towar by bands according to the number of their account by the hand ofjeiel the scribe and maaseiah the ruler under the hand of hananiahone of the kings captains the whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty menof valour were two thousand and six hundred and under their hand was an army three hundred thousand andseven thousand and five hundred that made war with mighty power tohelp the king against the enemy and uzziah prepared for them throughout all the host shieldsand spears and helmets and habergeons and bows and slings to caststones and he made in jerusalem engines invented by cunning men to beon the towers and upon the bulwarks to shoot arrows and great stoneswithaland his name spread far abroad for he was marvellously helped tillhe was strong but when he was strong his heart was lifted up to hisdestruction for he transgressed against the lord his god and wentinto the temple of the lord to burn incense upon the altar of incense and azariah the priest went in after him and with him fourscorepriests of the lord that were valiant men  and they withstooduzziah the king and said unto him it appertaineth not unto theeuzziah to burn incense unto the lord but to the priests the sons ofaaron that are consecrated to burn incense go out of the sanctuaryfor thou hast trespassed neither shall it be for thine honour fromthe lord god then uzziah was wroth and had a censer in his hand to burnincense and while he was wroth with the priests the leprosy evenrose up in his forehead before the priests in the house of the lordfrom beside the incense altar and azariah the chief priest and all the priests looked uponhim and behold he was leprous in his forehead and they thrust himout from thence yea himself hasted also to go out because the lordhad smitten him and uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death anddwelt in a several house being a leper for he was cut off from thehouse of the lord and jotham his son was over the kings housejudging the people of the land now the rest of the acts of uzziah first and last did isaiahthe prophet the son of amoz write so uzziah slept with his fathers and they buried him with hisfathers in the field of the burial which belonged to the kings forthey said he is a leper and jotham his son reigned in his stead jotham was twenty and five years old when he began to reign andhe reigned sixteen years in jerusalem his mothers name also wasjerushah the daughter of zadok and he did that which was right in the sight of the lordaccording to all that his father uzziah did howbeit he entered notinto the temple of the lord and the people did yet corruptly he built the high gate of the house of the lord and on the wallof ophel he built much moreover he built cities in the mountains of judah and in theforests he built castles and towers he fought also with the king of the ammonites and prevailedagainst them and the children of ammon gave him the same year anhundred talents of silver and ten thousand measures of wheat and tenthousand of barley so much did the children of ammon pay unto himboth the second year and the third so jotham became mighty because he prepared his ways before thelord his god now the rest of the acts of jotham and all his wars and hisways lo they are written in the book of the kings of israel andjudah he was five and twenty years old when he began to reign andreigned sixteen years in jerusalem and jotham slept with his fathers and they buried him in thecity of david and ahaz his son reigned in his stead ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign and he reignedsixteen years in jerusalem but he did not that which was right in thesight of the lord like david his father  for he walked in theways of the kings of israel and made also molten images for baalim moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of hinnom andburnt his children in the fire after the abominations of the heathenwhom the lord had cast out before the children of israel he sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places and onthe hills and under every green tree wherefore the lord his god delivered him into the hand of theking of syria and they smote him and carried away a great multitudeof them captives and brought them to damascus and he was alsodelivered into the hand of the king of israel who smote him with agreat slaughter for pekah the son of remaliah slew in judah an hundred and twentythousand in one day which were all valiant men because they hadforsaken the lord god of their fathers and zichri a mighty man of ephraim slew maaseiah the kingsson and azrikam the governor of the house and elkanah that was nextto the king and the children of israel carried away captive of their brethrentwo hundred thousand women sons and daughters and took also awaymuch spoil from them and brought the spoil to samaria but a prophet of the lord was there whose name was oded and hewent out before the host that came to samaria and said unto thembehold because the lord god of your fathers was wroth with judah hehath delivered them into your hand and ye have slain them in a ragethat reacheth up unto heaven and now ye purpose to keep under the children of judah andjerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you but are there not withyou even with you sins against the lord your god   now hear metherefore and deliver the captives again which ye have taken captiveof your brethren for the fierce wrath of the lord is upon you then certain of the heads of the children of ephraim azariahthe son of johanan berechiah the son of meshillemoth and jehizkiahthe son of shallum and amasa the son of hadlai stood up against themthat came from the war  and said unto them ye shall not bringin the captives hither for whereas we have offended against the lordalready ye intend to add more to our sins and to our trespass forour trespass is great and there is fierce wrath against israel so the armed men left the captives and the spoil before theprinces and all the congregation and the men which were expressed by name rose up and took thecaptives and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among themand arrayed them and shod them and gave them to eat and to drinkand anointed them and carried all the feeble of them upon asses andbrought them to jericho the city of palm trees to their brethrenthen they returned to samaria at that time did king ahaz send unto the kings of assyria tohelp him for again the edomites had come and smitten judah and carriedaway captives the philistines also had invaded the cities of the low countryand of the south of judah and had taken bethshemesh and ajalon andgederoth and shocho with the villages thereof and timnah with thevillages thereof gimzo also and the villages thereof and they dweltthere for the lord brought judah low because of ahaz king of israelfor he made judah naked and transgressed sore against the lord and tilgathpilneser king of assyria came unto him anddistressed him but strengthened him not for ahaz took away a portion out of the house of the lord andout of the house of the king and of the princes and gave it unto theking of assyria but he helped him not and in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more againstthe lord this is that king ahaz for he sacrificed unto the gods of damascus which smote himand he said because the gods of the kings of syria help themtherefore will i sacrifice to them that they may help me but theywere the ruin of him and of all israel and ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of god andcut in pieces the vessels of the house of god and shut up the doorsof the house of the lord and he made him altars in every corner ofjerusalem and in every several city of judah he made high places to burnincense unto other gods and provoked to anger the lord god of hisfathers now the rest of his acts and of all his ways first and lastbehold they are written in the book of the kings of judah and israel and ahaz slept with his fathers and they buried him in thecity even in jerusalem but they brought him not into the sepulchresof the kings of israel and hezekiah his son reigned in his stead hezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenty years oldand he reigned nine and twenty years in jerusalem and his mothersname was abijah the daughter of zechariah and he did that which was right in the sight of the lordaccording to all that david his father had done he in the first year of his reign in the first month opened thedoors of the house of the lord and repaired them and he brought in the priests and the levites and gathered themtogether into the east street  and said unto them hear me yelevites sanctify now yourselves and sanctify the house of the lordgod of your fathers and carry forth the filthiness out of the holyplace for our fathers have trespassed and done that which was evil inthe eyes of the lord our god and have forsaken him and have turnedaway their faces from the habitation of the lord and turned theirbacks also they have shut up the doors of the porch and put out thelamps and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in theholy place unto the god of israel wherefore the wrath of the lord was upon judah and jerusalem andhe hath delivered them to trouble to astonishment and to hissing asye see with your eyes for lo our fathers have fallen by the sword and our sons andour daughters and our wives are in captivity for this now it is in mine heart to make a covenant with the lord god ofisrael that his fierce wrath may turn away from us my sons be not now negligent for the lord hath chosen you tostand before him to serve him and that ye should minister unto himand burn incense then the levites arose mahath the son of amasai and joel theson of azariah of the sons of the kohathites and of the sons ofmerari kish the son of abdi and azariah the son of jehalelel and ofthe gershonites joah the son of zimmah and eden the son of joah and of the sons of elizaphan shimri and jeiel and of the sonsof asaph zechariah and mattaniah  and of the sons of hemanjehiel and shimei and of the sons of jeduthun shemaiah and uzziel and they gathered their brethren and sanctified themselves andcame according to the commandment of the king by the words of thelord to cleanse the house of the lord and the priests went into the inner part of the house of thelord to cleanse it and brought out all the uncleanness that theyfound in the temple of the lord into the court of the house of thelord and the levites took it to carry it out abroad into the brookkidron now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctifyand on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of the lordso they sanctified the house of the lord in eight days and in thesixteenth day of the first month they made an end then they went in to hezekiah the king and said we havecleansed all the house of the lord and the altar of burnt offeringwith all the vessels thereof and the shewbread table with all thevessels thereof moreover all the vessels which king ahaz in his reign did castaway in his transgression have we prepared and sanctified andbehold they are before the altar of the lord then hezekiah the king rose early and gathered the rulers ofthe city and went up to the house of the lord and they brought seven bullocks and seven rams and sevenlambs and seven he goats for a sin offering for the kingdom and forthe sanctuary and for judah and he commanded the priests the sons ofaaron to offer them on the altar of the lord so they killed the bullocks and the priests received the bloodand sprinkled it on the altar likewise when they had killed therams they sprinkled the blood upon the altar they killed also thelambs and they sprinkled the blood upon the altar and they brought forth the he goats for the sin offering beforethe king and the congregation and they laid their hands upon them and the priests killed them and they made reconciliation withtheir blood upon the altar to make an atonement for all israel forthe king commanded that the burnt offering and the sin offering shouldbe made for all israel and he set the levites in the house of the lord with cymbalswith psalteries and with harps according to the commandment ofdavid and of gad the kings seer and nathan the prophet for so wasthe commandment of the lord by his prophets and the levites stood with the instruments of david and thepriests with the trumpets and hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon thealtarand when the burnt offering began the song of the lord began alsowith the trumpets and with the instruments ordained by david king ofisrael and all the congregation worshipped and the singers sang andthe trumpeters sounded and all this continued until the burntoffering was finished and when they had made an end of offering the king and all thatwere present with him bowed themselves and worshipped moreover hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the levitesto sing praise unto the lord with the words of david and of asaph theseer and they sang praises with gladness and they bowed their headsand worshipped then hezekiah answered and said now ye have consecratedyourselves unto the lord come near and bring sacrifices and thankofferings into the house of the lord and the congregation brought insacrifices and thank offerings and as many as were of a free heartburnt offerings and the number of the burnt offerings which the congregationbrought was threescore and ten bullocks an hundred rams and twohundred lambs all these were for a burnt offering to the lord and the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and threethousand sheep but the priests were too few so that they could not flay allthe burnt offerings wherefore their brethren the levites did helpthem till the work was ended and until the other priests hadsanctified themselves for the levites were more upright in heart tosanctify themselves than the priests and also the burnt offerings were in abundance with the fat ofthe peace offerings and the drink offerings for every burnt offeringso the service of the house of the lord was set in order and hezekiah rejoiced and all the people that god had preparedthe people for the thing was done suddenly and hezekiah sent to all israel and judah and wrote letters alsoto ephraim and manasseh that they should come to the house of thelord at jerusalem to keep the passover unto the lord god of israel for the king had taken counsel and his princes and all thecongregation in jerusalem to keep the passover in the second month for they could not keep it at that time because the priests hadnot sanctified themselves sufficiently neither had the peoplegathered themselves together to jerusalem and the thing pleased the king and all the congregation so they established a decree to make proclamation throughout allisrael from beersheba even to dan that they should come to keep thepassover unto the lord god of israel at jerusalem for they had notdone it of a long time in such sort as it was written so the posts went with the letters from the king and his princesthroughout all israel and judah and according to the commandment ofthe king saying ye children of israel turn again unto the lord godof abraham isaac and israel and he will return to the remnant ofyou that are escaped out of the hand of the kings of assyria and be not ye like your fathers and like your brethren whichtrespassed against the lord god of their fathers who therefore gavethem up to desolation as ye see now be ye not stiffnecked as your fathers were but yieldyourselves unto the lord and enter into his sanctuary which he hathsanctified for ever and serve the lord your god that the fiercenessof his wrath may turn away from you for if ye turn again unto the lord your brethren and yourchildren shall find compassion before them that lead them captive sothat they shall come again into this land for the lord your god isgracious and merciful and will not turn away his face from you if yereturn unto him so the posts passed from city to city through the country ofephraim and manasseh even unto zebulun but they laughed them toscorn and mocked them nevertheless divers of asher and manasseh and of zebulun humbledthemselves and came to jerusalem also in judah the hand of god was to give them one heart to dothe commandment of the king and of the princes by the word of thelord and there assembled at jerusalem much people to keep the feastof unleavened bread in the second month a very great congregation and they arose and took away the altars that were in jerusalemand all the altars for incense took they away and cast them into thebrook kidron then they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of thesecond month and the priests and the levites were ashamed andsanctified themselves and brought in the burnt offerings into thehouse of the lord and they stood in their place after their manner according tothe law of moses the man of god the priests sprinkled the bloodwhich they received of the hand of the levites for there were many in the congregation that were notsanctified therefore the levites had the charge of the killing of thepassovers for every one that was not clean to sanctify them unto thelord for a multitude of the people even many of ephraim andmanasseh issachar and zebulun had not cleansed themselves yet didthey eat the passover otherwise than it was written but hezekiahprayed for them saying the good lord pardon every one  thatprepareth his heart to seek god the lord god of his fathers thoughhe be not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary and the lord hearkened to hezekiah and healed the people and the children of israel that were present at jerusalem keptthe feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness and thelevites and the priests praised the lord day by day singing with loudinstruments unto the lord and hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the levites that taughtthe good knowledge of the lord and they did eat throughout the feastseven days offering peace offerings and making confession to thelord god of their fathers and the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven daysand they kept other seven days with gladness for hezekiah king of judah did give to the congregation athousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep and the princes gave tothe congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep and agreat number of priests sanctified themselves and all the congregation of judah with the priests and thelevites and all the congregation that came out of israel and thestrangers that came out of the land of israel and that dwelt injudah rejoiced so there was great joy in jerusalem for since the time ofsolomon the son of david king of israel there was not the like injerusalem then the priests the levites arose and blessed the people andtheir voice was heard and their prayer came up to his holy dwellingplace even unto heaven now when all this was finished all israel that were present wentout to the cities of judah and brake the images in pieces and cutdown the groves and threw down the high places and the altars out ofall judah and benjamin in ephraim also and manasseh until they hadutterly destroyed them all then all the children of israel returnedevery man to his possession into their own cities and hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the levitesafter their courses every man according to his service the priestsand levites for burnt offerings and for peace offerings to ministerand to give thanks and to praise in the gates of the tents of thelord he appointed also the kings portion of his substance for theburnt offerings to wit for the morning and evening burnt offeringsand the burnt offerings for the sabbaths and for the new moons andfor the set feasts as it is written in the law of the lord moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in jerusalem to givethe portion of the priests and the levites that they might beencouraged in the law of the lord and as soon as the commandment came abroad the children ofisrael brought in abundance the firstfruits of corn wine and oiland honey and of all the increase of the field and the tithe of allthings brought they in abundantly and concerning the children of israel and judah that dwelt inthe cities of judah they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheepand the tithe of holy things which were consecrated unto the lordtheir god and laid them by heaps in the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heapsand finished them in the seventh month and when hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps theyblessed the lord and his people israel then hezekiah questioned with the priests and the levitesconcerning the heaps and azariah the chief priest of the house of zadok answered himand said since the people began to bring the offerings into the houseof the lord we have had enough to eat and have left plenty for thelord hath blessed his people and that which is left is this greatstore then hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of thelord and they prepared them  and brought in the offerings andthe tithes and the dedicated things faithfully over which cononiahthe levite was ruler and shimei his brother was the next and jehiel and azaziah and nahath and asahel and jerimothand jozabad and eliel and ismachiah and mahath and benaiah wereoverseers under the hand of cononiah and shimei his brother at thecommandment of hezekiah the king and azariah the ruler of the houseof god and kore the son of imnah the levite the porter toward theeast was over the freewill offerings of god to distribute theoblations of the lord and the most holy things and next him were eden and miniamin and jeshua and shemaiahamariah and shecaniah in the cities of the priests in their setoffice to give to their brethren by courses as well to the great asto the small  beside their genealogy of males from three yearsold and upward even unto every one that entereth into the house ofthe lord his daily portion for their service in their chargesaccording to their courses  both to the genealogy of the priestsby the house of their fathers and the levites from twenty years oldand upward in their charges by their courses  and to thegenealogy of all their little ones their wives and their sons andtheir daughters through all the congregation for in their set officethey sanctified themselves in holiness  also of the sons ofaaron the priests which were in the fields of the suburbs of theircities in every several city the men that were expressed by name togive portions to all the males among the priests and to all that werereckoned by genealogies among the levites and thus did hezekiah throughout all judah and wrought thatwhich was good and right and truth before the lord his god and in every work that he began in the service of the house ofgod and in the law and in the commandments to seek his god he didit with all his heart and prospered after these things and the establishment thereof sennacheribking of assyria came and entered into judah and encamped against thefenced cities and thought to win them for himself and when hezekiah saw that sennacherib was come and that he waspurposed to fight against jerusalem  he took counsel with hisprinces and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains whichwere without the city and they did help him so there was gathered much people together who stopped all thefountains and the brook that ran through the midst of the landsaying why should the kings of assyria come and find much water also he strengthened himself and built up all the wall that wasbroken and raised it up to the towers and another wall without andrepaired millo in the city of david and made darts and shields inabundance and he set captains of war over the people and gathered themtogether to him in the street of the gate of the city and spakecomfortably to them saying  be strong and courageous be notafraid nor dismayed for the king of assyria nor for all the multitudethat is with him for there be more with us than with him  withhim is an arm of flesh but with us is the lord our god to help usand to fight our battles and the people rested themselves upon thewords of hezekiah king of judah after this did sennacherib king of assyria send his servants tojerusalem but he himself laid siege against lachish and all hispower with him unto hezekiah king of judah and unto all judah thatwere at jerusalem saying  thus saith sennacherib king ofassyria whereon do ye trust that ye abide in the siege in jerusalem doth not hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to die byfamine and by thirst saying the lord our god shall deliver us out ofthe hand of the king of assyria   hath not the same hezekiahtaken away his high places and his altars and commanded judah andjerusalem saying ye shall worship before one altar and burn incenseupon it   know ye not what i and my fathers have done unto allthe people of other lands were the gods of the nations of those landsany ways able to deliver their lands out of mine hand   who wasthere among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterlydestroyed that could deliver his people out of mine hand that yourgod should be able to deliver you out of mine hand   nowtherefore let not hezekiah deceive you nor persuade you on thismanner neither yet believe him for no god of any nation or kingdomwas able to deliver his people out of mine hand and out of the handof my fathers how much less shall your god deliver you out of minehand   and his servants spake yet more against the lord god andagainst his servant hezekiah he wrote also letters to rail on the lord god of israel and tospeak against him saying as the gods of the nations of other landshave not delivered their people out of mine hand so shall not the godof hezekiah deliver his people out of mine hand then they cried with a loud voice in the jews speech unto thepeople of jerusalem that were on the wall to affright them and totrouble them that they might take the city and they spake against the god of jerusalem as against the godsof the people of the earth which were the work of the hands of man and for this cause hezekiah the king and the prophet isaiah theson of amoz prayed and cried to heaven and the lord sent an angel which cut off all the mighty men ofvalour and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king ofassyria so he returned with shame of face to his own land and whenhe was come into the house of his god they that came forth of his ownbowels slew him there with the sword thus the lord saved hezekiah and the inhabitants of jerusalemfrom the hand of sennacherib the king of assyria and from the hand ofall other and guided them on every side and many brought gifts unto the lord to jerusalem and presentsto hezekiah king of judah so that he was magnified in the sight ofall nations from thenceforth in those days hezekiah was sick to the death and prayed untothe lord and he spake unto him and he gave him a sign but hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit doneunto him for his heart was lifted up therefore there was wrath uponhim and upon judah and jerusalem notwithstanding hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of hisheart both he and the inhabitants of jerusalem so that the wrath ofthe lord came not upon them in the days of hezekiah and hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour and he madehimself treasuries for silver and for gold and for precious stonesand for spices and for shields and for all manner of pleasantjewels  storehouses also for the increase of corn and wine andoil and stalls for all manner of beasts and cotes for flocks moreover he provided him cities and possessions of flocks andherds in abundance for god had given him substance very much this same hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of gihonand brought it straight down to the west side of the city of davidand hezekiah prospered in all his works howbeit in the business of the ambassadors of the princes ofbabylon who sent unto him to enquire of the wonder that was done inthe land god left him to try him that he might know all that was inhis heart now the rest of the acts of hezekiah and his goodness beholdthey are written in the vision of isaiah the prophet the son of amozand in the book of the kings of judah and israel and hezekiah slept with his fathers and they buried him in thechiefest of the sepulchres of the sons of david and all judah and theinhabitants of jerusalem did him honour at his death and manasseh hisson reigned in his stead manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign and hereigned fifty and five years in jerusalem  but did that which wasevil in the sight of the lord like unto the abominations of theheathen whom the lord had cast out before the children of israel for he built again the high places which hezekiah his father hadbroken down and he reared up altars for baalim and made groves andworshipped all the host of heaven and served them also he built altars in the house of the lord whereof the lordhad said in jerusalem shall my name be for ever and he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courtsof the house of the lord and he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valleyof the son of hinnom also he observed times and used enchantmentsand used witchcraft and dealt with a familiar spirit and withwizards he wrought much evil in the sight of the lord to provoke himto anger and he set a carved image the idol which he had made in thehouse of god of which god had said to david and to solomon his sonin this house and in jerusalem which i have chosen before all thetribes of israel will i put my name for ever  neither will i anymore remove the foot of israel from out of the land which i haveappointed for your fathers so that they will take heed to do all thati have commanded them according to the whole law and the statutes andthe ordinances by the hand of moses so manasseh made judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem to errand to do worse than the heathen whom the lord had destroyed beforethe children of israel and the lord spake to manasseh and to his people but theywould not hearken wherefore the lord brought upon them the captains of the host ofthe king of assyria which took manasseh among the thorns and boundhim with fetters and carried him to babylon and when he was in affliction he besought the lord his god andhumbled himself greatly before the god of his fathers  andprayed unto him and he was intreated of him and heard hissupplication and brought him again to jerusalem into his kingdomthen manasseh knew that the lord he was god now after this he built a wall without the city of david on thewest side of gihon in the valley even to the entering in at the fishgate and compassed about ophel and raised it up a very great heightand put captains of war in all the fenced cities of judah and he took away the strange gods and the idol out of the houseof the lord and all the altars that he had built in the mount of thehouse of the lord and in jerusalem and cast them out of the city and he repaired the altar of the lord and sacrificed thereonpeace offerings and thank offerings and commanded judah to serve thelord god of israel nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high placesyet unto the lord their god only now the rest of the acts of manasseh and his prayer unto hisgod and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name of thelord god of israel behold they are written in the book of the kingsof israel his prayer also and how god was intreated of him and all hissins and his trespass and the places wherein he built high placesand set up groves and graven images before he was humbled beholdthey are written among the sayings of the seers so manasseh slept with his fathers and they buried him in hisown house and amon his son reigned in his stead amon was two and twenty years old when he began to reign andreigned two years in jerusalem but he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord as didmanasseh his father for amon sacrificed unto all the carved imageswhich manasseh his father had made and served them  and humblednot himself before the lord as manasseh his father had humbledhimself but amon trespassed more and more and his servants conspired against him and slew him in his ownhouse but the people of the land slew all them that had conspiredagainst king amon and the people of the land made josiah his son kingin his stead josiah was eight years old when he began to reign and he reignedin jerusalem one and thirty years and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord andwalked in the ways of david his father and declined neither to theright hand nor to the left for in the eighth year of his reign while he was yet young hebegan to seek after the god of david his father and in the twelfthyear he began to purge judah and jerusalem from the high places andthe groves and the carved images and the molten images and they brake down the altars of baalim in his presence and theimages that were on high above them he cut down and the groves andthe carved images and the molten images he brake in pieces and madedust of them and strowed it upon the graves of them that hadsacrificed unto them and he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars andcleansed judah and jerusalem and so did he in the cities of manasseh and ephraim and simeoneven unto naphtali with their mattocks round about and when he had broken down the altars and the groves and hadbeaten the graven images into powder and cut down all the idolsthroughout all the land of israel he returned to jerusalem now in the eighteenth year of his reign when he had purged theland and the house he sent shaphan the son of azaliah and maaseiahthe governor of the city and joah the son of joahaz the recorder torepair the house of the lord his god and when they came to hilkiah the high priest they delivered themoney that was brought into the house of god which the levites thatkept the doors had gathered of the hand of manasseh and ephraim andof all the remnant of israel and of all judah and benjamin and theyreturned to jerusalem and they put it in the hand of the workmen that had theoversight of the house of the lord and they gave it to the workmenthat wrought in the house of the lord to repair and amend the house even to the artificers and builders gave they it to buy hewnstone and timber for couplings and to floor the houses which thekings of judah had destroyed and the men did the work faithfully and the overseers of themwere jahath and obadiah the levites of the sons of merari andzechariah and meshullam of the sons of the kohathites to set itforward and other of the levites all that could skill of instrumentsof musick also they were over the bearers of burdens and were overseersof all that wrought the work in any manner of service and of thelevites there were scribes and officers and porters and when they brought out the money that was brought into thehouse of the lord hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of thelord given by moses and hilkiah answered and said to shaphan the scribe i havefound the book of the law in the house of the lord and hilkiahdelivered the book to shaphan and shaphan carried the book to the king and brought the kingword back again saying all that was committed to thy servants theydo it and they have gathered together the money that was found in thehouse of the lord and have delivered it into the hand of theoverseers and to the hand of the workmen then shaphan the scribe told the king saying hilkiah thepriest hath given me a book and shaphan read it before the king and it came to pass when the king had heard the words of thelaw that he rent his clothes and the king commanded hilkiah and ahikam the son of shaphanand abdon the son of micah and shaphan the scribe and asaiah aservant of the kings saying  go enquire of the lord for meand for them that are left in israel and in judah concerning thewords of the book that is found for great is the wrath of the lordthat is poured out upon us because our fathers have not kept the wordof the lord to do after all that is written in this book and hilkiah and they that the king had appointed went tohuldah the prophetess the wife of shallum the son of tikvath the sonof hasrah keeper of the wardrobe now she dwelt in jerusalem in thecollege and they spake to her to that effect and she answered them thus saith the lord god of israel tellye the man that sent you to me  thus saith the lord behold iwill bring evil upon this place and upon the inhabitants thereofeven all the curses that are written in the book which they have readbefore the king of judah  because they have forsaken me andhave burned incense unto other gods that they might provoke me toanger with all the works of their hands therefore my wrath shall bepoured out upon this place and shall not be quenched and as for the king of judah who sent you to enquire of thelord so shall ye say unto him thus saith the lord god of israelconcerning the words which thou hast heard  because thine heartwas tender and thou didst humble thyself before god when thouheardest his words against this place and against the inhabitantsthereof and humbledst thyself before me and didst rend thy clothesand weep before me i have even heard thee also saith the lord behold i will gather thee to thy fathers and thou shalt begathered to thy grave in peace neither shall thine eyes see all theevil that i will bring upon this place and upon the inhabitants ofthe same so they brought the king word again then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of judahand jerusalem and the king went up into the house of the lord and all the menof judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem and the priests and thelevites and all the people great and small and he read in theirears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in thehouse of the lord and the king stood in his place and made a covenant before thelord to walk after the lord and to keep his commandments and histestimonies and his statutes with all his heart and with all hissoul to perform the words of the covenant which are written in thisbook and he caused all that were present in jerusalem and benjamin tostand to it and the inhabitants of jerusalem did according to thecovenant of god the god of their fathers and josiah took away all the abominations out of all thecountries that pertained to the children of israel and made all thatwere present in israel to serve even to serve the lord their god andall his days they departed not from following the lord the god oftheir fathers moreover josiah kept a passover unto the lord in jerusalem andthey killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month and he set the priests in their charges and encouraged them tothe service of the house of the lord  and said unto the levitesthat taught all israel which were holy unto the lord put the holyark in the house which solomon the son of david king of israel didbuild it shall not be a burden upon your shoulders serve now thelord your god and his people israel  and prepare yourselves bythe houses of your fathers after your courses according to thewriting of david king of israel and according to the writing ofsolomon his son and stand in the holy place according to the divisions of thefamilies of the fathers of your brethren the people and after thedivision of the families of the levites so kill the passover and sanctify yourselves and prepare yourbrethren that they may do according to the word of the lord by thehand of moses and josiah gave to the people of the flock lambs and kids allfor the passover offerings for all that were present to the numberof thirty thousand and three thousand bullocks these were of thekings substance and his princes gave willingly unto the people to the priestsand to the levites hilkiah and zechariah and jehiel rulers of thehouse of god gave unto the priests for the passover offerings twothousand and six hundred small cattle and three hundred oxen conaniah also and shemaiah and nethaneel his brethren andhashabiah and jeiel and jozabad chief of the levites gave unto thelevites for passover offerings five thousand small cattle and fivehundred oxen so the service was prepared and the priests stood in theirplace and the levites in their courses according to the kingscommandment and they killed the passover and the priests sprinkled theblood from their hands and the levites flayed them and they removed the burnt offerings that they might giveaccording to the divisions of the families of the people to offerunto the lord as it is written in the book of moses and so did theywith the oxen and they roasted the passover with fire according to theordinance but the other holy offerings sod they in pots and incaldrons and in pans and divided them speedily among all the people and afterward they made ready for themselves and for thepriests because the priests the sons of aaron were busied in offeringof burnt offerings and the fat until night therefore the levitesprepared for themselves and for the priests the sons of aaron and the singers the sons of asaph were in their place accordingto the commandment of david and asaph and heman and jeduthun thekings seer and the porters waited at every gate they might notdepart from their service for their brethren the levites prepared forthem so all the service of the lord was prepared the same day tokeep the passover and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar of

present and the inhabitants ofjerusalem in the eighteenth year of the reign of josiah was this passoverkept after all this when josiah had prepared the temple necho kingof egypt came up to fight against charchemish by euphrates and josiahwent out against him but he sent ambassadors to him saying what have i to do withthee thou king of judah i come not against thee this day butagainst the house wherewith i have war for god commanded me to makehaste forbear thee from meddling with god who is with me that hedestroy thee not nevertheless josiah would not turn his face from him butdisguised himself that he might fight with him and hearkened notunto the words of necho from the mouth of god and came to fight inthe valley of megiddo and the archers shot at king josiah and the king said to hisservants have me away for i am sore wounded his servants therefore took him out of that chariot and put himin the second chariot that he had and they brought him to jerusalemand he died and was buried in one of the sepulchres of his fathersand all judah and jerusalem mourned for josiah and jeremiah lamented for josiah and all the singing men andthe singing women spake of josiah in their lamentations to this dayand made them an ordinance in israel and behold they are written inthe lamentations now the rest of the acts of josiah and his goodness accordingto that which was written in the law of the lord  and his deedsfirst and last behold they are written in the book of the kings ofisrael and judah then the people of the land took jehoahaz the son of josiah andmade him king in his fathers stead in jerusalem jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reignand he reigned three months in jerusalem and the king of egypt put him down at jerusalem and condemnedthe land in an hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold and the king of egypt made eliakim his brother king over judahand jerusalem and turned his name to jehoiakim and necho

the lord his god against him came up nebuchadnezzar king of babylon and bound himin fetters to carry him to babylon nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of thelord to babylon and put them in his temple at babylon now the rest of the acts of jehoiakim and his abominations whichhe did and that which was found in him behold they are written inthe book of the kings of israel and judah and jehoiachin his sonreigned in his stead jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign and hereigned three months and ten days in jerusalem and he did that whichwas evil in the sight

zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reignand reigned eleven years in jerusalem and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord his godand humbled not himself before jeremiah the prophet speaking from themouth of the lord and he also rebelled against king nebuchadnezzar who had madehim swear by god but he stiffened his neck and hardened his heartfrom turning unto the lord god of israel moreover all the chief of the priests and the peopletransgressed very much after all the abominations of the heathen andpolluted the house of the lord which he had hallowed in jerusalem and the lord god of their fathers sent to them by hismessengers rising up betimes and sending because he had compassionon his people and on his dwelling place  but they mocked themessengers of god and despised his words and misused his prophetsuntil the wrath of the lord arose against his people till there wasno remedy therefore he brought upon them the king of the chaldees whoslew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuaryand had no compassion upon young man or maiden old man or him thatstooped for age he gave them all into his hand and all the vessels of the house of god great and small andthe treasures of the house of the lord and the treasures of the kingand of his princes all these he brought to babylon and they burnt the house of god and brake down the wall ofjerusalem and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire and destroyedall the goodly vessels thereof and them that had escaped from the sword carried he away tobabylon where they were servants to him

priests and the levites and some of the people and thesingers and the porters and the nethinims dwelt in their citiesand all israel in their cities and when the seventh month was come and the children of israelwere in the cities the people gathered themselves together as one manto jerusalem then stood up jeshua the son of jozadak and his brethren thepriests and zerubbabel the son of shealtiel and his brethren andbuilded the altar of the god of israel to offer burnt offeringsthereon as it is written in the law of moses the man of god and they set the altar upon his bases for fear was upon thembecause of the people of those countries and they offered burntofferings thereon unto the lord even burnt offerings morning andevening they kept also the feast of tabernacles as it is written andoffered the daily burnt offerings by number according to the customas the duty of every day required  and afterward offered thecontinual burnt offering both of the new moons and of all the setfeasts of the lord that were consecrated and of every one thatwillingly offered a freewill offering unto the lord from the first day of the seventh month began they to offer burntofferings unto the lord but the foundation of the temple of the lordwas not yet laid they gave money also unto the masons and to the carpenters andmeat and drink and oil unto them of zidon and to them of tyre tobring cedar trees from lebanon to the sea of joppa according to thegrant that they had of cyrus king of persia now in the second year of their coming unto the house of god atjerusalem in the second month began zerubbabel the son of shealtieland jeshua the son of jozadak and the remnant of their brethren thepriests and the levites and all they that were come out of thecaptivity unto jerusalem and appointed the levites from twenty yearsold and upward to set forward the work of the house of the lord then stood jeshua with his sons and his brethren kadmiel and hissons the sons of judah together to set forward the workmen in thehouse of god the sons of henadad with their sons and their brethrenthe levites and when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of thelord they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets and thelevites the sons of asaph with cymbals to praise the lord after theordinance of david king of israel and they sang together by course in praising and giving thanksunto the lord because he is good for his mercy endureth for evertoward israeland all the people shouted with a great shout when they praised thelord because the foundation of the house of the lord was laid but many of the priests and levites and chief of the fathers whowere ancient men that had seen the first house when the foundationof this house was laid before their eyes wept with a loud voice andmany shouted aloud for joy  so that the people could not discernthe noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of thepeople for the people shouted with a loud shout and the noise washeard afar off now when the adversaries of judah and benjamin heard that thechildren of the captivity builded the temple unto the lord god ofisrael  then they came to zerubbabel and to the chief of thefathers and said unto them let us build with you for we seek yourgod as ye do and we do sacrifice unto him since the days ofesarhaddon king of assur which brought us up hither but zerubbabel and jeshua and the rest of the chief of thefathers of israel said unto them ye have nothing to do with us tobuild an house unto our god but we ourselves together will build untothe lord god of israel as king cyrus the king of persia hathcommanded us then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people ofjudah and troubled them in building  and hired counsellorsagainst them to frustrate their purpose all the days of cyrus kingof persia even until the reign of darius king of persia and in the reign of ahasuerus in the beginning of his reignwrote they unto him an accusation against the inhabitants of judah andjerusalem and in the days of artaxerxes wrote bishlam mithredath tabeeland the rest of their companions unto artaxerxes king of persia andthe writing of the letter was written in the syrian tongue andinterpreted in the syrian tongue rehum the chancellor and shimshai the scribe wrote a letteragainst jerusalem to artaxerxes the king in this sort  then wroterehum the chancellor and shimshai the scribe and the rest of theircompanions the dinaites the apharsathchites the tarpelites theapharsites the archevites the babylonians the susanchites thedehavites and the elamites  and the rest of the nations whom thegreat and noble asnapper brought over and set in the cities ofsamaria and the rest that are on this side the river and at such atime this is the copy of the letter that they sent unto him even untoartaxerxes the king thy servants the men on this side the river andat such a time be it known unto the king that the jews which came up from theeto us are come unto jerusalem building the rebellious and the badcity and have set up the walls thereof and joined the foundations be it known now unto the king that if this city be builded andthe walls set up again then will they not pay toll tribute andcustom and so thou shalt endamage the revenue of the kings now because we have maintenance from the kings palace and itwas not meet for us to see the kings dishonour therefore have wesent and certified the king  that search may be made in the bookof the records of thy fathers so shalt thou find in the book of therecords and know that this city is a rebellious city and hurtfulunto kings and provinces and that they have moved sedition within thesame of old time for which cause was this city destroyed we certify the king that if this city be builded again and thewalls thereof set up by this means thou shalt have no portion on thisside the river then sent the king an answer unto rehum the chancellor and toshimshai the scribe and to the rest of their companions that dwell insamaria and unto the rest beyond the river peace and at such atime the letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read beforeme and i commanded and search hath been made and it is found thatthis city of old time hath made insurrection against kings and thatrebellion and sedition have been made therein there have been mighty kings also over jerusalem which haveruled over all countries beyond the river and toll tribute andcustom was paid unto them give ye now commandment to cause these men to cease and thatthis city be not builded until another commandment shall be givenfrom me take heed now that ye fail not to do this why should damage growto the hurt of the kings   now when the copy of king artaxerxesletter was read before rehum and shimshai the scribe and theircompanions they went up in haste to jerusalem unto the jews and madethem to cease by force and power then ceased the work of the house of god which is at jerusalemso it ceased unto the second year of the reign of darius king ofpersia then the prophets haggai the prophet and zechariah the son ofiddo prophesied unto the jews that were in judah and jerusalem in thename of the god of israel even unto them then rose up zerubbabel the son of shealtiel and jeshua the sonof jozadak and began to build the house of god which is at jerusalemand with them were the prophets of god helping them at the same time came to them tatnai governor on this side theriver and shetharboznai and their companions and said thus untothem who hath commanded you to build this house and to make up thiswall   then said we unto them after this manner what are thenames of the men that make this building   but the eye of theirgod was upon the elders of the jews that they could not cause them tocease till the matter came to darius and then they returned answerby letter concerning this matter the copy of the letter that tatnai governor on this side theriver and shetharboznai and his companions the apharsachites whichwere on this side the river sent unto darius the king  they senta letter unto him wherein was written thus unto darius the king allpeace be it known unto the king that we went into the province ofjudea to the house of the great god which is builded with greatstones and timber is laid in the walls and this work goeth fast onand prospereth in their hands then asked we those elders and said unto them thus who commandedyou to build this house and to make up these walls   we askedtheir names also to certify thee that we might write the names ofthe men that were the chief of them and thus they returned us answer saying we are the servants ofthe god of heaven and earth and build the house that was buildedthese many years ago which a great king of israel builded and set up but after that our fathers had provoked the god of heaven untowrath he gave them into the hand of nebuchadnezzar the king ofbabylon the chaldean who destroyed this house and carried thepeople away into babylon but in the first year of cyrus the king of babylon the same kingcyrus made a decree to build this house of god and the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of

extended mercy unto me before theking and his counsellors and before all the kings mighty princesand i was strengthened as the hand of the lord my god was upon me andi gathered together out of israel chief men to go up with me these are now the chief of their fathers and this is thegenealogy of them that went up with me from babylon in the reign ofartaxerxes the king of the sons of phinehas gershom of the sons of ithamar danielof the sons of david hattush of the sons of shechaniah of the sons of pharosh zechariah andwith him were reckoned by genealogy of the males an hundred and fifty of

alsotwenty basons of gold of a thousand drams and two vessels of finecopper precious as gold and i said unto them ye are holy unto the lord the vessels areholy also and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering untothe lord god of your fathers watch ye and keep them until ye weigh them before the chief ofthe priests and the levites and chief of the fathers of israel atjerusalem in the chambers of the house of the lord so took the priests and the levites the weight of the silver andthe gold and the vessels to bring them to jerusalem unto the houseof our god then we departed from the river of ahava on the twelfth day ofthe first month to go unto jerusalem and the hand of our god wasupon us and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy and of suchas lay in wait by the way and we came to jerusalem and abode there three days now on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the vesselsweighed in the house of our god by the hand of meremoth the son ofuriah the priest and with him was eleazar the son of phinehas andwith them was jozabad the son of jeshua and noadiah the son ofbinnui levites  by number and by weight of every one and allthe weight was written at that time also the children of those that had been carried away which werecome out of the captivity offered burnt offerings unto the god ofisrael twelve bullocks for all israel ninety and six rams seventyand seven lambs twelve he goats for a sin offering all this was aburnt offering unto the lord and they delivered the kings commissions unto the kingslieutenants and to the governors on this side the river and theyfurthered the people and the house of god now when these things were done the princes came to me sayingthe people of israel and the priests and the levites have notseparated themselves from the people of the lands doing according totheir abominations even of the canaanites the hittites theperizzites the jebusites the ammonites the moabites the egyptiansand the amorites for they have taken of their daughters for themselves and fortheir sons so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with thepeople of those lands yea the hand of the princes and rulers hathbeen chief in this trespass and when i heard this thing i rent my garment and my mantle andplucked off the hair of my head and of my beard and sat downastonied then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the wordsof the god of israel because of the transgression of those that hadbeen carried away and i sat astonied until the evening sacrifice and at the evening sacrifice i arose up from my heaviness andhaving rent my garment and my mantle i fell upon my knees and spreadout my hands unto the lord my god  and said o my god i amashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee my god for ouriniquities are increased over our head and our trespass is grown upunto the heavens since the days of our fathers have we been in a great trespassunto this day and for our iniquities have we our kings and ourpriests been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands tothe sword to captivity and to a spoil and to confusion of face asit is this day and now for a little space grace hath been shewed from the lordour god to leave us a remnant to escape and to give us a nail in hisholy place that our god may lighten our eyes and give us a littlereviving in our bondage for we were bondmen yet our god hath not forsaken us in ourbondage but hath extended mercy unto us in the sight of the kings ofpersia to give us a reviving to set up the house of our god and torepair the desolations thereof and to give us a wall in judah and injerusalem and now o our god what shall we say after this for we haveforsaken thy commandments  which thou hast commanded by thyservants the prophets saying the land unto which ye go to possessit is an unclean land with the filthiness of the people of the landswith their abominations which have filled it from one end to anotherwith their uncleanness now therefore give not your daughters unto their sons neithertake their daughters unto your sons nor seek their peace or theirwealth for ever that ye may be strong and eat the good of the landand leave it for an inheritance to your children for ever and after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds and forour great trespass seeing that thou our god hast punished us lessthan our iniquities deserve and hast given us such deliverance asthis  should we again break thy commandments and join inaffinity with the people of these abominations wouldest not thou beangry with us till thou hadst consumed us so that there should be noremnant nor escaping   o lord god of israel thou art righteousfor we remain yet escaped as it is this day behold we are beforethee in our trespasses for we cannot stand before thee because ofthis now when ezra had prayed and when he had confessed weeping andcasting himself down before the house of god there assembled unto himout of israel a very great congregation of men and women and childrenfor the people wept very sore and shechaniah the son of jehiel one of the sons of elamanswered and said unto ezra we have trespassed against our god andhave taken strange wives of the people of the land yet now there ishope in israel concerning this thing now therefore let us make a covenant with our god to put away allthe wives and such as are born of them according to the counsel ofmy lord and of those that tremble at the commandment of our god andlet it be done according to the law arise for this matter belongeth unto thee we also will be withthee be of good courage and do it then arose ezra and made the chief priests the levites and allisrael to swear that they should do according to this word and theysware then ezra rose up from before the house of god and went into thechamber of johanan the son of eliashib and when he came thither hedid eat no bread nor drink water for he mourned because of thetransgression of them that had been carried away and they made proclamation throughout judah and jerusalem untoall the children of the captivity that they should gather themselvestogether unto jerusalem  and that whosoever would not come withinthree days according to the counsel of the princes and the eldersall his substance should be forfeited and himself separated from thecongregation of those that had been carried away then all the men of judah and benjamin gathered themselvestogether unto jerusalem within three days it was the ninth month onthe twentieth day of the month and all the people sat in the streetof the house of god trembling because of this matter and for thegreat rain and ezra the priest stood up and said unto them ye havetransgressed and have taken strange wives to increase the trespassof israel now therefore make confession unto the lord god of your fathersand do his pleasure and separate yourselves from the people of theland and from the strange wives then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voiceas thou hast said so must we do but the people are many and it is a time of much rain and weare not able to stand without neither is this a work of one day ortwo for we are many that have transgressed in this thing let now our rulers of all the congregation stand and let allthem which have taken strange wives in our cities come at appointedtimes and with them the elders of every city and the judges thereofuntil the fierce wrath of our god for this matter be turned from us only jonathan the son of asahel and jahaziah the son of tikvahwere employed about this matter and meshullam and shabbethai thelevite helped them and the children of the captivity did so and ezra the priestwith certain chief of the fathers after the house of their fathersand all of them by their names were separated and sat down in thefirst day of the tenth month to examine the matter and they made an end with all the men that had taken strangewives by the first day of the first month and among the sons of the priests there were found that hadtaken strange wives namely of the sons of jeshua the son of jozadakand his brethren maaseiah and eliezer and jarib and gedaliah and they gave their hands that

that hanani one of my brethren came he and certain menof judah and i asked them concerning the jews that had escaped whichwere left of the captivity and concerning jerusalem and they said unto me the remnant that are left of the captivitythere in the province are in great affliction and reproach the wallof jerusalem also is broken down and the gates thereof are burnedwith fire and it came to pass when i heard these words that i sat down andwept and mourned certain days and fasted and prayed before the godof heaven  and said i beseech thee o lord god of heaven thegreat and terrible god that keepeth covenant and mercy for them thatlove him and observe his commandments  let thine ear now beattentive and thine eyes open that thou mayest hear the prayer ofthy servant which i pray before thee now day and night for thechildren of israel thy servants and confess the sins of the childrenof israel which we have sinned against thee both i and my fathershouse have sinned we have dealt very corruptly against thee and have not kept thecommandments nor the statutes nor the judgments which thoucommandedst thy servant moses remember i beseech thee the word that thou commandedst thyservant moses saying if ye transgress i will scatter you abroadamong the nations  but if ye turn unto me and keep mycommandments and do them though there were of you cast out unto theuttermost part of the heaven yet will i gather them from thence andwill bring them unto the place that i have chosen to set my namethere now these are thy servants and thy people whom thou hastredeemed by thy great power and by thy strong hand o lord i beseech thee let now thine ear be attentive to theprayer of thy servant and to the prayer of thy servants who desireto fear thy name and prosper i pray thee thy servant this day andgrant him mercy in the sight of this man for i was the kingscupbearer and it came to pass in the month nisan in the twentieth year ofartaxerxes the king that wine was before him and i took up the wineand gave it unto the king now i had not been beforetime sad in hispresence wherefore the king said unto me why is thy countenance sadseeing thou art not sick this is nothing else but sorrow of heartthen i was very sore afraid  and said unto the king let the kinglive for ever why should not my countenance be sad when the citythe place of my fathers sepulchres lieth waste and the gatesthereof are consumed with fire   then the king said unto me forwhat dost thou make request so i prayed to the god of heaven and i said unto the king if it please the king and if thyservant have found favour in thy sight that thou wouldest send meunto judah unto the city of my fathers sepulchres that i may buildit and the king said unto me the queen also sitting by him forhow long shall thy journey be and when wilt thou return so itpleased the king to send me and i set him a time moreover i said unto the king if it please the king let lettersbe given me to the governors beyond the river that they may convey meover till i come into judah  and a letter unto asaph the keeper ofthe kings forest that he may give me timber to make beams for thegates of the palace which appertained to the house and for the wallof the city and for the house that i shall enter into and the kinggranted me according to the good hand of my god upon me then i came to the governors beyond the river and gave them thekings letters now the king had sent captains of the army andhorsemen with me when sanballat the horonite and tobiah the servant theammonite heard of it it grieved them exceedingly that there was comea man to seek the welfare of the children of israel so i came to jerusalem and was there three days and i arose in the night i and some few men with me neithertold i any man what my god had put in my heart to do at jerusalemneither was there any beast with me save the beast that i rode upon and i went out by night by the gate of the valley even beforethe dragon well and to the dung port and viewed the walls ofjerusalem which were broken down and the gates thereof were consumedwith fire then i went on to the gate of the fountain and to the kingspool but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass then went i up in the night by the brook and viewed the walland turned back and entered by the gate of the valley and soreturned and the rulers knew not whither i went or what i did neitherhad i as yet told it to the jews nor to the priests nor to thenobles nor to the rulers nor to the rest that did the work then said i unto them ye see the distress that we are in howjerusalem lieth waste and the gates thereof are burned with firecome and let us build up the wall of jerusalem that we be no more areproach then i told them of the hand of my god which was good upon me asalso the kings words that he had spoken unto me and they said letus rise up and build so they strengthened their hands for this goodwork but when sanballat the horonite and tobiah the servant theammonite and geshem the arabian heard it they laughed us to scornand despised us and said what is this thing that ye do will yerebel against the king   then answered i them and said untothem the god of heaven he will prosper us therefore we his servantswill arise and build but ye have no portion nor right nor memorialin jerusalem then eliashib the high priest rose up with his

great indignation and mocked the jews and he spake before his brethren and the army of samaria andsaid what do these feeble jews will they fortify themselves willthey sacrifice  will they make an end in a day will they revive thestones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned   nowtobiah the ammonite was by him and he said even that which theybuild if a fox go up he shall even break down their stone wall hear o our god for we are despised and turn their reproach upontheir own head and give them for a prey in the land of captivity and cover not their iniquity and let not their sin be blotted outfrom before thee for they have provoked thee to anger before thebuilders so built we the wall and all the wall was joined together untothe half thereof for the people had a mind to work but it came to pass that when sanballat and tobiah and thearabians and the ammonites and the ashdodites heard that the wallsof jerusalem were made up and that the breaches began to be stoppedthen they were very wroth  and conspired all of them together tocome and to fight against jerusalem and to hinder it nevertheless we made our prayer unto our god and set a watchagainst them day and night because of them and judah said the strength of the bearers of burdens isdecayed and there is much rubbish so that we are not able to buildthe wall and our adversaries said they shall not know neither see tillwe come in the midst among them and slay them and cause the work tocease and it came to pass that when the jews which dwelt by them camethey said unto us ten times from all places whence ye shall returnunto us they will be upon you therefore set i in the lower places behind the wall and on thehigher places i even set the people after their families with theirswords their spears and their bows and i looked and rose up and said unto the nobles and to therulers and to the rest of the people be not ye afraid of themremember the lord which is great and terrible and fight for yourbrethren your sons and your daughters your wives and your houses and it came to pass when our enemies heard that it was knownunto us and god had brought their counsel to nought that we returnedall of us to the wall every one unto his work and it came to pass from that time forth that the half of myservants wrought in the work and the other half of them held both thespears the shields and the bows and the habergeons and the rulerswere behind all the house of judah they which builded on the wall and they that bare burdens withthose that laded every one with one of his hands wrought in the workand with the other hand held a weapon for the builders every one had his sword girded by his side andso builded and he that sounded the trumpet was by me and i said unto the nobles and to the rulers and to the rest ofthe people the work is great and large and we are separated upon thewall one far from another in what place therefore ye hear the sound of the trumpet resortye thither unto us our god shall fight for us so we laboured in the work and half of them held the spears fromthe rising of the morning till the stars appeared likewise at the same time said i unto the people let every onewith his servant lodge within jerusalem that in the night they may bea guard to us and labour on the day so neither i nor my brethren nor my servants nor the men ofthe guard which followed me none of us put off our clothes savingthat every one put them off for washing and there was a great cry of the people and of their wives againsttheir brethren the jews for there were that said we our sons and our daughters aremany therefore we take up corn for them that we may eat and live some also there were that said we have mortgaged our landsvineyards and houses that we might buy corn because of the dearth there were also that said we have borrowed money for the kingstribute and that upon our lands and vineyards yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren our children astheir children and lo we bring into bondage our sons and ourdaughters to be servants and some of our daughters are brought untobondage already neither is it in our power to redeem them for othermen have our lands and vineyards and i was very angry when i heard their cry and these words then i consulted with myself and i rebuked the nobles and therulers and said unto them ye exact usury every one of his brotherand i set a great assembly against them and i said unto them we after our ability have redeemed ourbrethren the jews which were sold unto the heathen and will ye evensell your brethren or shall they be sold unto us then held theytheir peace and found nothing to answer also i said it is not good that ye do ought ye not to walk inthe fear of our god because of the reproach of the heathen ourenemies   i likewise and my brethren and my servants mightexact of them money and corn i pray you let us leave off this usury restore i pray you to them even this day their lands theirvineyards their oliveyards and their houses also the hundredth partof the money and of the corn the wine and the oil that ye exact ofthem then said they we will restore them and will require nothing ofthem so will we do as thou sayest then i called the priests andtook an oath of them that they should do according to this promise also i shook my lap and said so god shake out every man fromhis house and from his labour that performeth not this promise eventhus be he shaken out and emptied and all the congregation saidamen and praised the lord and the people did according to thispromise moreover from the time that i was appointed to be their governorin the land of judah from the twentieth year even unto the two andthirtieth year of artaxerxes the king that is twelve years i and mybrethren have not eaten the bread of the governor but the former governors that had been before me were chargeableunto the people and had taken of them bread and wine beside fortyshekels of silver yea even their servants bare rule over the peoplebut so did not i because of the fear of god yea also i continued in the work of this wall neither bought weany land and all my servants were gathered thither unto the work moreover there were at my table an hundred and fifty of the jewsand rulers beside those that came unto us from among the heathen thatare about us now that which was prepared for me daily was one ox and sixchoice sheep also fowls were prepared for me and once in ten daysstore of all sorts of wine yet for all this required not i the breadof the governor because the bondage was heavy upon this people think upon me my god for good according to all that i havedone for this people now it came to pass when sanballat and tobiah and geshem thearabian and the rest of our enemies heard that i had builded thewall and that there was no breach left therein though at that timei had not set up the doors upon the gates  that sanballat andgeshem sent unto me saying come let us meet together in some one ofthe villages in the plain of ono but they thought to do me mischief and i sent messengers unto them saying i am doing a great workso that i cannot come down why should the work cease whilst i leaveit and come down to you   yet they sent unto me four times afterthis sort and i answered them after the same manner then sent sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifthtime with an open letter in his hand  wherein was written it isreported among the heathen and gashmu saith it that thou and thejews think to rebel for which cause thou buildest the wall that thoumayest be their king according to these words and thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee atjerusalem saying there is a king in judah and now shall it bereported to the king according to these words come now therefore andlet us take counsel together then i sent unto him saying there are no such things done asthou sayest but thou feignest them out of thine own heart for they all made us afraid saying their hands shall be weakenedfrom the work that it be not done now therefore o god strengthenmy hands afterward i came unto the house of shemaiah the son of delaiahthe son of mehetabeel who was shut up and he said let us meettogether in the house of god within the temple and let us shut thedoors of the temple for they will come to slay thee yea in thenight will they come to slay thee and i said should such a man as i flee and who is there thatbeing as i am would go into the temple to save his life i will notgo in and lo i perceived that god had not sent him but that hepronounced this prophecy against me for tobiah and sanballat hadhired him therefore was he hired that i should be afraid and do so andsin and that they might have matter for an evil report that theymight reproach me my god think thou upon tobiah and sanballat according to thesetheir works and on the prophetess noadiah and the rest of theprophets that would have put me in fear so the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the monthelul in fifty and two days and it came to pass that when all our enemies heard thereof andall the heathen that were about us saw these things they were muchcast down in their own eyes for they perceived that this work waswrought of our god moreover in those days the nobles of judah sent many letters untotobiah and the letters of tobiah came unto them for there were many in judah sworn unto him because he was theson in law of shechaniah the son of arah and his son johanan hadtaken the daughter of meshullam the son of berechiah also they reported his good deeds before me and uttered my wordsto him and tobiah sent letters to put me in fear now it came to pass when the wall was built and i had set up thedoors and the porters and the singers and the levites were appointed that i gave my brother hanani and hananiah the ruler of thepalace charge over jerusalem for he was a faithful man and fearedgod above many and i said unto them let not the gates of jerusalem be openeduntil the sun be hot and while they stand by let them shut thedoors and bar them and appoint watches of the inhabitants ofjerusalem every one in his watch and every one to be over againsthis house now the city was large and great but the people were few thereinand the houses were not builded and my god put into mine heart to gather together the nobles andthe rulers and the people that they might be reckoned by genealogyand i found a register of the genealogy of them which came up at thefirst and found written therein  these are the children of theprovince that went up out of the captivity of those that had beencarried away whom nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon had carriedaway and came again to jerusalem and to judah every one unto hiscity  who came with zerubbabel jeshua nehemiah azariahraamiah

even thou art lord alone thou hast made heaven the heavenof heavens with all their host the earth and all things that aretherein the seas and all that is therein and thou preservest themall and the host of heaven worshippeth thee thou art the lord the god who didst choose abram and broughtesthim forth out of ur of the chaldees and gavest him the name ofabraham  and foundest his heart faithful before thee and madest acovenant with him to give the land of the canaanites the hittitesthe amorites and the perizzites and the jebusites and thegirgashites to give it i say to his seed and hast performed thywords for thou art righteous  and didst see the affliction of ourfathers in egypt and heardest their cry by the red sea  andshewedst signs and wonders upon pharaoh and on all his servants andon all the people of his land for thou knewest that they dealtproudly against them so didst thou get thee a name as it is thisday and thou didst divide the sea before them so that they wentthrough the midst of the sea on the dry land and their persecutorsthou threwest into the deeps as a stone into the mighty waters moreover thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar and inthe night by a pillar of fire to give them light in the way whereinthey should go thou camest down also upon mount sinai and spakest with themfrom heaven and gavest them right judgments and true laws goodstatutes and commandments  and madest known unto them thy holysabbath and commandedst them precepts statutes and laws by thehand of moses thy servant  and gavest them bread from heaven fortheir hunger and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock fortheir thirst and promisedst them that they should go in to possessthe land which thou hadst sworn to give them but they and our fathers dealt proudly and hardened their necksand hearkened not to thy commandments  and refused to obeyneither were mindful of thy wonders that thou didst among them buthardened their necks and in their rebellion appointed a captain toreturn to their bondage but thou art a god ready to pardon graciousand merciful slow to anger and of great kindness and forsookestthem not yea when they had made them a molten calf and said this is thygod that brought thee up out of egypt and had wrought greatprovocations  yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest themnot in the wilderness the pillar of the cloud departed not from themby day to lead them in the way neither the pillar of fire by nightto shew them light and the way wherein they should go thou gavest also thy good spirit to instruct them andwithheldest not thy manna from their mouth and gavest them water fortheir thirst yea forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness sothat they lacked nothing their clothes waxed not old and their feetswelled not moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and nations and didst dividethem into corners so they possessed the land of sihon and the landof the king of heshbon and the land of og king of bashan their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven andbroughtest them into the land concerning which thou hadst promised totheir fathers that they should go in to possess it so the children went in and possessed the land and thousubduedst before them the inhabitants of the land the canaanites andgavest them into their hands with their kings and the people of theland that they might do with them as they would and they took strong cities and a fat land and possessed housesfull of all goods wells digged vineyards and oliveyards and fruittrees in abundance so they did eat and were filled and became fatand delighted themselves in thy great goodness nevertheless they were disobedient and rebelled against theeand cast thy law behind their backs and slew thy prophets whichtestified against them to turn them to thee and they wrought greatprovocations therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their enemieswho vexed them and in the time of their trouble when they cried untothee thou heardest them from heaven and according to thy manifoldmercies thou gavest them saviours who saved them out of the hand oftheir enemies but after they had rest they did evil again before theetherefore leftest thou them in the land of their enemies so that theyhad the dominion over them yet when they returned and cried untothee thou heardest them from heaven and many times didst thoudeliver them according to thy mercies  and testifiedst againstthem that thou mightest bring them again unto thy law yet they dealtproudly and hearkened not unto thy commandments but sinned againstthy judgments which if a man do he shall live in them andwithdrew the shoulder and hardened their neck and would not hear yet many years didst thou forbear them and testifiedst againstthem by thy spirit in thy prophets yet would they not give eartherefore gavest thou them into the hand of the people of the lands nevertheless for thy great mercies sake thou didst not utterlyconsume them nor forsake them for thou art a gracious and mercifulgod now therefore our god the great the mighty and the terriblegod who keepest covenant and mercy let not all the trouble seemlittle before thee that hath come upon us on our kings on ourprinces and on our priests and on our prophets and on our fathersand on all thy people since the time of the kings of assyria untothis day howbeit thou art just in

and thechildren rejoiced so that the joy of jerusalem was heard even afaroff and at that time were some appointed over the chambers for thetreasures for the offerings for the firstfruits and for the tithesto gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions ofthe law for the priests and levites for judah rejoiced for thepriests and for the levites that waited and both the singers and the porters kept the ward of their godand the ward of the purification according to the commandment ofdavid and of solomon his son for in the days of david and asaph of old there were chief ofthe singers and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto god and all israel in the days of zerubbabel and in the days ofnehemiah gave the portions of the singers and the porters every dayhis portion and they sanctified holy things unto the levites and thelevites sanctified them unto the children of aaron on that day they read in the book of moses in the audience of thepeople and therein was found written that the ammonite and themoabite should not come into the congregation of god for ever because they met not the children of israel with bread and with waterbut hired balaam against them that he should curse them howbeit ourgod turned the curse into a blessing now it came to pass when they had heard the law that theyseparated from israel all the mixed multitude and before this eliashib the priest having the oversight of thechamber of the house of our god was allied unto tobiah  and hehad prepared for him a great chamber where aforetime they laid themeat offerings the frankincense and the vessels and the tithes ofthe corn the new wine and the oil which was commanded to be givento the levites and the singers and the porters and the offerings ofthe priests but in all this time was not i at jerusalem for in the two andthirtieth year of artaxerxes king of babylon came i unto the king andafter certain days obtained i leave of the king  and i came tojerusalem and understood of the evil that eliashib did for tobiah inpreparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of god and it grieved me sore therefore i cast forth all the householdstuff to tobiah out of the chamber then i commanded and they cleansed the chambers and thitherbrought i again the vessels of the house of god with the meatoffering and the frankincense and i perceived that the portions of the levites had not beengiven them for the levites and the singers that did the work werefled every one to his field then contended i with the rulers and said why is the house ofgod forsaken and i gathered them together and set them in theirplace then brought all judah the tithe of the corn and the new wineand the oil unto the treasuries and i made treasurers over the treasuries shelemiah the priestand zadok the scribe and of the levites pedaiah and next to themwas hanan the son of zaccur the son of mattaniah for they werecounted faithful and their office was to distribute unto theirbrethren remember me o my god concerning this and wipe not out my gooddeeds that i have done for the house of my god and for the officesthereof in those days saw i in judah some treading wine presses on thesabbath and bringing in sheaves and lading asses as also winegrapes and figs and all manner of burdens which they brought intojerusalem on the sabbath day and i testified against them in the daywherein they sold victuals there dwelt men of tyre also therein which brought fish andall manner of ware and sold on the sabbath unto the children ofjudah and in jerusalem then i contended with the nobles of judah and said unto themwhat evil thing is this that ye do and profane the sabbath day did not your fathers thus and did not our god bring all thisevil upon us and upon this city yet ye bring more wrath upon israelby profaning the sabbath and it came to pass that when the gates of jerusalem began tobe dark before the sabbath i commanded that the gates should be shutand charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath andsome of my servants set i at the gates that there should no burden bebrought in on the sabbath day so the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged withoutjerusalem once or twice then i testified against them and said unto them why lodge yeabout the wall if ye do so again i will lay hands on you from thattime forth came they no more on the sabbath and i commanded the levites that they should cleanse themselvesand that they should come and keep the gates to sanctify the sabbathdayremember me o my god concerning this also and spare me according tothe greatness of thy mercy in those days also saw i jews that had married wives of ashdodof ammon and of moab  and their children spake half in thespeech of ashdod and could not speak in the jews language butaccording to the language of each people and i contended with them and cursed them and smote certain ofthem and plucked off their hair and made them swear by god sayingye shall not give your daughters unto their sons nor take theirdaughters unto your sons or for yourselves did not solomon king of israel sin by these things yet amongmany nations was there no king like him who was beloved of his godand god made him king over all israel nevertheless even him didoutlandish women cause to sin shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil totransgress against our god in marrying strange wives   and oneof the sons of joiada the son of eliashib the high priest was son inlaw to sanballat the horonite therefore i chased him from me remember them o my god because they have defiled thepriesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and of the levites thus cleansed i them from all strangers and appointed the wardsof the priests and the levites every one in his business  andfor the wood offering at times appointed and for the firstfruitsremember me o my god for goodthe book of esther now it came to pass in the days of ahasuerus this is ahasueruswhich reigned from india even unto ethiopia over an hundred andseven and twenty provinces  that in those days when the kingahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom which was in shushan thepalace  in the third year of his reign he made a feast unto allhis princes and his servants the power of persia and media thenobles and princes of the provinces being before him  when heshewed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of hisexcellent majesty many days even an hundred and fourscore days and when these days were expired the king made a feast unto allthe people that were present in shushan the palace both unto greatand small seven days in the court of the garden of the kingspalace  where were white green and blue hangings fastened withcords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marblethe beds were of gold and silver upon a pavement of red and blueand white and black marble and they gave them drink in vessels of gold the vessels beingdiverse one from another and royal wine in abundance according tothe state of the king and the drinking was according to the law none did compel for sothe king had appointed to all the officers of his house that theyshould do according to every mans pleasure also vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royalhouse which belonged to king ahasuerus on the seventh day when the heart of the king was merry withwine he commanded mehuman biztha harbona bigtha and abagthazethar and carcas the seven chamberlains that served in the presenceof ahasuerus the king  to bring vashti the queen before the kingwith the crown royal to shew the people and the princes her beautyfor she was fair to look on but the queen vashti refused to come at the kings commandment byhis chamberlains therefore was the king very wroth and his angerburned in him then the king said to the wise men which knew the times for sowas the kings manner toward all that knew law and judgment  andthe next unto him was carshena shethar admatha tarshish meresmarsena and memucan the seven princes of persia and media which sawthe kings face and which sat the first in the kingdom  whatshall we do unto the queen vashti according to law because she hathnot performed the commandment of the king ahasuerus by thechamberlains   and memucan answered before the king and theprinces vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only butalso to all the princes and to all the people that are in all theprovinces of the king ahasuerus for this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women sothat they shall despise their husbands in their eyes when it shall bereported the king ahasuerus commanded vashti the queen to be broughtin before him but she came not likewise shall the ladies of persia and media say this day untoall the kings princes which have heard of the deed of the queenthus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath if it please the king let there go a royal commandment from himand let it be written among the laws of the persians and the medesthat it be not altered that vashti come no more before kingahasuerus and let the king give her royal estate unto another that isbetter than she and when the kings decree which he shall make shall be publishedthroughout all his empire for it is great all the wives shall giveto their husbands honour both to great and small and the saying pleased the king and the princes and the king didaccording to the word of memucan  for he sent letters into allthe kings provinces into every province according to the writingthereof and to every people after their language that every manshould bear rule in his own house and that it should be publishedaccording to the language of every people after these things when the wrath of king ahasuerus was appeasedhe remembered vashti and what she had done and what was decreedagainst her then said the kings servants that ministered unto him let therebe fair young virgins sought for the king  and let the kingappoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom that they maygather together all the fair young virgins unto shushan the palace tothe house of the women unto the custody of hege the kingschamberlain keeper of the women and let their things forpurification be given them  and let the maiden which pleaseth theking be queen instead of vashtiand the thing pleased the king and he did so now in shushan the palace there was a certain jew whose name wasmordecai the son of jair the son of shimei the son of kish abenjamite  who had been carried away from jerusalem with thecaptivity which had been carried away with jeconiah king of judahwhom nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon had carried away and he brought up hadassah that is esther his uncles daughterfor she had neither father nor mother and the maid was fair andbeautiful whom mordecai when her father and mother were dead tookfor his own daughter so it came to pass when the kings commandment and his decree washeard and when many maidens were gathered together unto shushan thepalace to the custody of hegai that esther was brought also unto thekings house to the custody of hegai keeper of the women and the maiden pleased him and she obtained kindness of him andhe speedily gave her her things for purification with such things asbelonged to her and seven maidens which were meet to be given herout of the kings house and he preferred her and her maids unto thebest place of the house of the women esther had not shewed her people nor her kindred for mordecaihad charged her that she should not shew it and mordecai walked every day before the court of the womenshouse to know how esther did and what should become of her now when every maids turn was come to go in to king ahasuerusafter that she had been twelve months according to the manner of thewomen for so were the days of their purifications accomplished towit six months with oil of myrrh and six months with sweet odoursand with other things for the purifying of the women  then thuscame every maiden unto the king whatsoever she desired was given herto go with her out of the house of the women unto the kings house in the evening she went and on the morrow she returned into thesecond house of the women to the custody of shaashgaz the kingschamberlain which kept the concubines she came in unto the king nomore except the king delighted in her and that she were called byname now when the turn of esther the daughter of abihail the uncle ofmordecai who had taken her for his daughter was come to go in untothe king she required nothing but what hegai the kings chamberlainthe keeper of the women appointed and esther obtained favour in thesight of all them that looked upon her so esther was taken unto king ahasuerus into his house royal inthe tenth month which is the month tebeth in the seventh year of hisreign and the king loved esther above all the women and she obtainedgrace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins so that heset the royal crown upon her head and made her queen instead ofvashti then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and hisservants even esthers feast and he made a release to the provincesand gave gifts according to the state of the king and when the virgins were gathered together the second time thenmordecai sat in the kings gate esther had not yet shewed her kindred nor her people as mordecaihad charged her for esther did the commandment of mordecai like aswhen she was brought up with him in those days while mordecai sat in the kings gate two of thekings chamberlains bigthan and teresh of those which kept the doorwere wroth and sought to lay hands on the king ahasuerus and the thing was known to mordecai who told it unto esther thequeen and esther certified the king thereof in mordecais name and when inquisition was made of the matter it was found outtherefore they were both hanged on a tree and it was written in thebook of the chronicles before the king after these things did king ahasuerus promote haman the son ofhammedatha the agagite and advanced him and set his seat above allthe princes that were with him and all the kings servants that were in the kings gate bowedand reverenced haman for the king had so commanded concerning himbut mordecai bowed not nor did him reverence then the kings servants which were in the kings gate said untomordecai why transgressest thou the kings commandment   now itcame to pass when they spake daily unto him and he hearkened notunto them that they told haman to see whether mordecais matterswould stand for he had told them that he was a jew and when haman saw that mordecai bowed not nor did him reverencethen was haman full of wrath and he thought scorn to lay hands on mordecai alone for they hadshewed him the people of mordecai wherefore haman sought to destroyall the jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of ahasuerus eventhe people of mordecai in the first month that is the month nisan in the twelfth yearof king ahasuerus they cast pur that is the lot before haman fromday to day and from month to month to the twelfth month that isthe month adar and haman said unto king ahasuerus there is a certain peoplescattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provincesof thy kingdom and their laws are diverse from all people neitherkeep they the kings laws therefore it is not for the kings profitto suffer them if it please the king let it be written that they may bedestroyed and i will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the handsof those that have the charge of the business to bring it into thekings treasuries and the king took his ring from his hand and gave it unto hamanthe son of hammedatha the agagite the jews enemy and the king said unto haman the silver is given to thee thepeople also to do with them as it seemeth good to thee then were the kings scribes called on the thirteenth day of thefirst month and there was written according to all that haman hadcommanded unto the kings lieutenants and to the governors that wereover every province and to the rulers of every people of everyprovince according to the writing thereof and to every people aftertheir language in the name of king ahasuerus was it written andsealed with the kings ring and the letters were sent by posts into all the kings provincesto destroy to kill and to cause to perish all jews both young andold little children and women in one day even upon the thirteenthday of the twelfth month which is the month adar and to take thespoil of them for a prey the copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in everyprovince was published unto all people that they should be readyagainst that day the posts went out being hastened by the kings commandment andthe decree was given in shushan the palace and the king and haman satdown to drink but the city shushan was perplexed when mordecai perceived all that was done mordecai rent hisclothes and put on sackcloth with ashes and went out into the midstof the city and cried with a loud and a bitter cry  and came evenbefore the kings gate for none might enter into the kings gateclothed with sackcloth and in every province whithersoever the kings commandment andhis decree came there was great mourning among the jews and fastingand weeping and wailing and many lay in sackcloth and ashes so esthers maids and her chamberlains came and told it her thenwas the queen exceedingly grieved and she sent raiment to clothemordecai and to take away his sackcloth from him but he received itnot then called esther for hatach one of the kings chamberlainswhom he had appointed to attend upon her and gave him a commandmentto mordecai to know what it was and why it was so hatach went forth to mordecai unto the street of the citywhich was before the kings gate and mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him and ofthe sum of the money that haman had promised to pay to the kingstreasuries for the jews to destroy them also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that wasgiven at shushan to destroy them to shew it unto esther and todeclare it unto her and to charge her that she should go in unto theking to make supplication unto him and to make request before himfor her people and hatach came and told esther the words of mordecai again esther spake unto hatach and gave him commandment untomordecai  all the kings servants and the people of the kingsprovinces do know that whosoever whether man or women shall comeunto the king into the inner court who is not called there is onelaw of his to put him to death except such to whom the king shallhold out the golden sceptre that he may live but i have not beencalled to come in unto the king these thirty days and they told to mordecai esthers words then mordecai commanded to answer esther think not with thyselfthat thou shalt escape in the kings house more than all the jews for if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time then shallthere enlargement and deliverance arise to the jews from anotherplace but thou and thy fathers house shall be destroyed and whoknoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this then esther bade them return mordecai this answer  gogather together all the jews that are present in shushan and fast yefor me and neither eat nor drink three days night or day i also andmy maidens will fast likewise and so will i go in unto the kingwhich is not according to the law and if i perish i perish so mordecai went his way and did according to all that estherhad commanded him now it came to pass on the third day that esther put on her royalapparel and stood in the inner court of the kings house overagainst the kings house and the king sat upon his royal throne inthe royal house over against the gate of the house and it was so when the king saw esther the queen standing in thecourt that she obtained favour in his sight and the king held out toesther the golden sceptre that was in his hand so esther drew nearand touched the top of the sceptre then said the king unto her what wilt thou queen esther andwhat is thy request it shall be even given thee to the half of thekingdom and esther answered if it seem good unto the king let the kingand haman come this day unto the banquet that i have prepared for him then the king said cause haman to make haste that he may do asesther hath said so the king and haman came to the banquet thatesther had prepared and the king said unto esther at the banquet of wine what is thypetition and it shall be granted thee and what is thy request evento the half of the kingdom it shall be

king andhaman come to the banquet that i shall prepare for them and i will doto morrow as the king hath said then went haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart butwhen haman saw mordecai in the kings gate that he stood not up normoved for him he was full of indignation against mordecai nevertheless haman refrained himself and when he came home hesent and called for his friends and zeresh his wife and haman told them of the glory of his riches and the multitudeof his children and all the things wherein the king had promoted himand how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of theking haman said moreover yea esther the queen did let no man come inwith the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself andto morrow am i invited unto her also with the king yet all this availeth me nothing so long as i see mordecai thejew sitting at the kings gate then said zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him let agallows be made of fifty cubits high and to morrow speak thou untothe king that mordecai may be hanged thereon then go thou in merrilywith the king unto the banquet and the thing pleased haman and hecaused the gallows to be made on that night could not the king sleep and he commanded to bringthe book of records of the chronicles and they were read before theking and it was found written that mordecai had told of bigthana andteresh two of the kings chamberlains the keepers of the door whosought to lay hand on the king ahasuerus and the king said what honour and dignity hath been done tomordecai for this then said the kings servants that ministered untohim there is nothing done for him and the king said who is in the court now haman was come intothe outward court of the kings house to speak unto the king to hangmordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him and the kings servants said unto him behold haman standeth inthe court and the king said let him come in so haman came in and the king said unto him what shall be doneunto the man whom the king delighteth to honour now haman thought inhis heart to whom would the king delight to do honour more than tomyself   and haman answered the king for the man whom the kingdelighteth to honour  let the royal apparel be brought which theking useth to wear and the horse that the king rideth upon and thecrown royal which is set upon his head  and let this apparel andhorse be delivered to the hand of one of the kings most nobleprinces that they may array the man withal whom the king delightethto honour and bring him on horseback through the street of the cityand proclaim before him thus shall it be done to the man whom theking delighteth to honour then the king said to haman make haste and take the apparel andthe horse as thou hast said and do even so to mordecai the jew thatsitteth at the kings gate let nothing fail of all that thou hastspoken then took haman the apparel and the horse and arrayed mordecaiand brought him on horseback through the

having his head covered and haman told zeresh his wife and all his friends every thingthat had befallen him then said his wise men and zeresh his wife untohim if mordecai be of the seed of the jews before whom thou hastbegun to fall thou shalt not prevail against him but shalt surelyfall before him and while they were yet talking with him came the kingschamberlains and hasted to bring haman unto the banquet that estherhad prepared so the king and haman came to banquet with esther the queen and the king said again unto esther on the second day at thebanquet of wine what is thy petition queen

and bondwomen i had held my tonguealthough the enemy could not countervail the kings damage then the king ahasuerus answered and said unto esther the queenwho is he and where is he that durst presume in his heart to do so and esther said the adversary and enemy is this wicked hamanthen haman was afraid before the king and the queen and the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath wentinto the palace garden and haman stood up to make request for hislife to esther the queen for he saw that there was evil determinedagainst him by the king then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place ofthe banquet of wine and haman was fallen upon the bed whereon estherwas then said the king will he force the queen also before me in thehouse as the word went out of kings mouth they covered hamansface and harbonah one of the chamberlains said before the kingbehold also the gallows fifty cubits high which haman had made formordecai who spoken good for the king standeth in the house ofhaman then the king said hang him thereon so they hanged haman on the gallows that he had prepared formordecai then was the kings wrath pacified on that day did the king ahasuerus give the house of haman thejews enemy unto esther the queen and mordecai came before the kingfor esther had told what he was unto her and the king took off his ring which he had taken from haman andgave it unto mordecai and esther set mordecai over the house ofhaman and esther spake yet again before the king and fell down at hisfeet and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of hamanthe agagite and his device that he had devised against the jews then the king held out the golden sceptre toward esther so estherarose and stood before the king  and said if it please the kingand if i have favour in his sight and the thing seem right before theking and i be pleasing in his eyes let it be written to reverse theletters devised by haman the son of hammedatha the agagite which hewrote to destroy the jews which are in all the kings provinces for how can i endure to see the evil that shall come unto my peopleor how can i endure to see the destruction of my kindred   thenthe king ahasuerus said unto esther the queen and to mordecai the jewbehold i have given esther the house of haman and him they havehanged upon the gallows because he laid his hand upon the jews write ye also for the jews as it liketh you in the kings nameand seal it with the kings ring for the writing which is written inthe kings name and sealed with the kings ring may no man reverse then were the kings scribes called at that time in the thirdmonth that is the month sivan on the three and twentieth daythereof and it was written according to all that mordecai commandedunto the jews and to the lieutenants and the deputies and rulers ofthe provinces which are from india unto ethiopia an hundred twentyand seven provinces unto every province according to the writingthereof and unto every people after their language and to the jewsaccording to their writing and according to their language and he wrote in the king ahasuerus name and sealed it with thekings ring and sent letters by posts on horseback and riders onmules camels and young dromedaries  wherein the king grantedthe jews which were in every city to gather themselves together andto stand for their life to destroy to slay and to cause to perishall the power of the people and province that would assault them bothlittle ones and women and to take the spoil of them for a prey upon one day in all the provinces of king ahasuerus namely upon thethirteenth day of the twelfth month which is the month adar the copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in everyprovince was published unto all people and that the jews should beready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies so the posts that rode upon mules and camels went out beinghastened and pressed on by the kings commandment and the decree wasgiven at shushan the palace and mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royalapparel of blue and white and with a great crown of gold and with agarment of fine linen and purple and the city of shushan rejoiced andwas glad the jews had light and gladness and joy and honour and in every province and in every city whithersoever thekings commandment and his decree came the jews had joy and gladnessa feast and a good day and many of the people of the land becamejews for the fear of the jews fell upon them now in the twelfth month that is the month adar on thethirteenth day of the same when the kings commandment and his decreedrew near to be put in execution in the day that the enemies of thejews hoped to have power over them though it was turned to thecontrary that the jews had rule over them that hated them  thejews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all theprovinces of the king ahasuerus to lay hand on such as sought theirhurt and no man could withstand them for the fear of them fell uponall people and all the rulers of the provinces and the lieutenants and thedeputies and officers of the king helped the jews because the fearof mordecai fell upon them for mordecai was great in the kings house and his fame went outthroughout all the provinces for this man mordecai waxed greater andgreater thus the jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of thesword and slaughter and destruction and did what they would untothose that hated them and in shushan the palace the jews slew and destroyed five hundredmen and parshandatha and dalphon and aspatha  and poratha andadalia and aridatha  and parmashta and arisai and aridai andvajezatha  the ten sons of haman the son of hammedatha the enemyof the jews slew they but on the spoil laid they not their hand on that day the number of those that were slain in shushan thepalace was brought before the king and the king said unto esther the queen the jews have slain anddestroyed five hundred men in shushan the palace and the ten sons ofhaman what have they done in the rest of the kings provinces nowwhat is thy petition and it shall be granted thee or what is thyrequest further and it shall be done then said esther if it please the king let it be granted to thejews which are in shushan to do to morrow also according unto thisdays decree and let hamans ten sons be hanged upon the gallows and the king commanded it so to be done and the decree was givenat shushan and they hanged hamans ten sons for the jews that were in shushan gathered themselves together onthe fourteenth day also of the month adar and slew three hundred menat shushan but on the prey they laid not their hand but the other jews that were in the kings provinces gatheredthemselves together and stood for their lives and had rest fromtheir enemies and slew of their foes seventy and five thousand butthey laid not their hands on the prey  on the thirteenth day ofthe month adar and on the fourteenth day of the same rested they andmade it a day of feasting and gladness but the jews that were at shushan assembled together on thethirteenth day thereof and on the fourteenth thereof and on thefifteenth day of the same they rested and made it a day of feastingand gladness therefore the jews of the villages that dwelt in the unwalledtowns made the fourteenth day of the month adar a day of gladness andfeasting and a good day and of sending portions one to another and mordecai wrote these things and sent letters unto all thejews that were in all the provinces of the king ahasuerus both nighand far  to stablish this among them that they should keep thefourteenth day of the month adar and the fifteenth day of the sameyearly  as the days wherein the jews rested from their enemiesand the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to joy and frommourning into a good day that they should make them days of feastingand joy and of sending portions one to another and gifts to thepoor and the jews undertook to do as they had begun and as mordecaihad written unto them  because haman the son of hammedatha theagagite the enemy of all the jews had devised against the jews todestroy them and had cast pur that is the lot to consume them andto destroy them  but when esther came before the king hecommanded by letters that his wicked device which he devised againstthe jews should return upon his own head and that he and his sonsshould be hanged on the gallows wherefore they called these days purim after the name of purtherefore for all the words of this letter and of that which they hadseen concerning this matter and which had come unto them  thejews ordained and took upon them and upon their seed and upon allsuch as joined themselves unto them so as it should not fail thatthey would keep these two days according to their writing andaccording to their appointed time every year  and that these daysshould be remembered and kept throughout every generation everyfamily every province and every city and that these days of purimshould not fail from among the jews nor the memorial of them perishfrom their seed then esther the queen the daughter of abihail and mordecai thejew wrote with all authority to confirm this second letter of purim and he sent the letters unto all the jews to the hundred twentyand seven provinces of the kingdom of ahasuerus with words of peaceand truth  to confirm these days of purim in their timesappointed according as mordecai the jew and esther the queen hadenjoined them and as they had decreed for themselves and for theirseed the matters of the fastings and their cry and the decree of esther confirmed these matters of purim and itwas written in the book and the king ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land and upon theisles of the sea and all the acts of his power and of his might and thedeclaration of the greatness of mordecai whereunto the king advancedhim are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kingsof media and persia   for mordecai the jew was next unto kingahasuerus and great among the jews and accepted of the multitude ofhis brethren seeking the wealth of his people and speaking peace toall his seedthe book of job there was a man in the land of uz whose name was job and thatman was perfect and upright and one that feared god and eschewed evil and there were born unto him seven sons and three

all themen of the east and his sons went and feasted in their houses every one his dayand sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink withthem and it was so when the days of their feasting were gone aboutthat job sent and sanctified them and rose up early in the morningand offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all forjob said it may be that my sons have sinned and cursed god in theirhearts thus did job continually now there was a day when the sons of god came to presentthemselves before the lord and satan came also among them and the lord said unto satan whence comest thou then satananswered the lord and said from going to and fro in the earth andfrom walking up and down in it and the lord said unto satan hast thou considered my servant jobthat there is none like him in the earth a perfect and an uprightman one that feareth god and escheweth evil   then satananswered the lord and said doth job fear god for nought   hastnot thou made an hedge about him and about his house and about allthat he hath on every side thou hast blessed the work of his handsand his substance is increased in the land but put forth thine hand now and touch all that he hath and hewill curse thee to thy face and the lord said unto satan behold all that he hath is in thypower only upon himself put not forth thine hand so satan went forthfrom the presence of the lord and there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eatingand drinking wine in their eldest brothers house  and there camea messenger unto job and said the oxen were plowing and the assesfeeding beside them  and the sabeans fell upon them and tookthem away yea they have slain the servants with the edge of thesword and i only am escaped alone to tell thee while he was yet speaking there came

also another and said thechaldeans made out three bands and fell upon the camels and havecarried them away yea and slain the servants with the edge of thesword and i only am escaped alone to tell thee while he was yet speaking there came also another and said thysons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldestbrothers house  and behold there came a great wind from thewilderness and smote the four corners of the house and it fell uponthe young men and they are dead and i only am escaped alone to tellthee then job arose and rent his mantle and shaved his head andfell down upon the ground and worshipped  and said naked came iout of my mothers womb and naked shall i return thither the lordgave and the lord hath taken away blessed be the name of the lord in all this job sinned not nor charged god foolishly again there was a day when the sons of god came to presentthemselves before the lord and satan came also among them to presenthimself before the lord and the lord said unto satan from whence comest thou and satananswered the lord and said from going to and fro in the earth andfrom walking up and down in it and the lord said unto satan hast thou considered my servant jobthat there is none like him in the earth a perfect and an uprightman one that feareth god and escheweth evil and still he holdethfast his integrity although thou movedst me against him to destroyhim without cause and satan answered the lord and said skin for skin yea allthat a man hath will he give for his life but put forth thine hand now and touch his bone and his fleshand he will curse thee to thy face and the lord said unto satan behold he is in thine hand butsave his life so went satan forth from the presence of the lord and smote jobwith sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown and he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal and he satdown among the ashes then said his wife unto him dost thou still retain thineintegrity  curse god and die but he said unto her thou speakest as one of the foolish womenspeaketh what shall we receive good at the hand of god and shall wenot receive evil in all this did not job sin with his lips now when jobs three friends heard of all this evil that was comeupon him they came every one from his own place eliphaz thetemanite and bildad the shuhite and zophar the naamathite for theyhad made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and tocomfort him and when they lifted up their eyes afar off and knew him notthey lifted up their voice and wept and they rent every one hismantle and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven so they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and sevennights and none spake a word unto him for they saw that his griefwas very great after this opened job his mouth and cursed his day and job spake and said  let the day perish wherein i wasborn and the night in which it was said there is a man childconceived let that day be darkness let not god regard it from aboveneither let the light shine upon it let darkness and the shadow of death stain it let a cloud dwellupon it let the blackness of the day terrify it as for that night let darkness seize upon it let it not bejoined unto the days of the year let it not come into the number ofthe months lo let that night be solitary let no joyful voice come therein let them curse it that curse the day who are ready to raise uptheir mourning let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark let it look forlight but have none neither let it see the dawning of the day because it shut not up the doors of my mothers womb nor hid sorrowfrom mine eyes why died i not from the womb why did i not give up the ghostwhen i came out of the belly   why did the knees prevent me orwhy the breasts that i should suck   for now should i have lainstill and been quiet i should have slept then had i been at rest with kings and counsellors of the earth which build desolateplaces for themselves  or with princes that had gold who filledtheir houses with silver  or as an hidden untimely birth i hadnot been as infants which never saw light there the wicked cease from troubling and there the weary be atrest there the prisoners rest together they hear not the voice of theoppressor the small and great are there and the servant is free from hismaster wherefore is light given to him that is in misery and life untothe bitter in soul  which long for death but it cometh not anddig for it more than for hid treasures  which rejoiceexceedingly and are glad when they can find the grave   why islight given to a man whose way is hid and whom god hath hedged in for my sighing cometh before i eat and my roarings are pouredout like the waters for the thing which i greatly feared is come upon me and thatwhich i was afraid of is come unto me i was not in safety neither had i rest neither was i quiet yettrouble came then eliphaz the temanite answered and said  if we assay tocommune with thee wilt thou be grieved but who can withhold himselffrom speaking   behold thou hast instructed many and thou haststrengthened the weak hands thy words have upholden him that was falling and thou haststrengthened the feeble knees but now it is come upon thee and thou faintest it toucheth theeand thou art troubled is not this thy fear thy confidence thy hope and theuprightness of thy ways   remember i pray thee who everperished being innocent or where were the righteous cut off  even as i have seen they that plow iniquity and sow wickedness reapthe same by the blast of god they perish and by the breath of his nostrilsare they consumed the roaring of the lion and the voice of the fierce lion andthe teeth of the young lions are broken the old lion perisheth for lack of prey and the stout lionswhelps are scattered abroad now a thing was secretly brought to me and mine ear received alittle thereof in thoughts from the visions of the night when deep sleepfalleth on men  fear came upon me and trembling which made allmy bones to shake then a spirit passed before my face the hair of my flesh stoodup  it stood still but i could not discern the form thereof animage was before mine eyes there was silence and i heard a voicesaying  shall mortal man be more just than god shall a man bemore pure than his maker   behold he put no trust in hisservants and his angels he charged with folly  how much less inthem that dwell in houses of clay whose foundation is in the dustwhich are crushed before the moth   they are destroyed frommorning to evening they perish for ever without any regarding it doth not their excellency which is in them go away they dieeven without wisdom call now if there be any that will answer thee and to which ofthe saints wilt thou turn   for wrath killeth the foolish man andenvy slayeth the silly one i have seen the foolish taking root but suddenly i cursed hishabitation his children are far from safety and they are crushed in thegate neither is there any to deliver them whose harvest the hungry eateth up and taketh it even out of thethorns and the robber swalloweth up their substance although affliction cometh not forth of the dust neither dothtrouble spring out of the ground  yet man is born unto trouble asthe sparks fly upward i would seek unto god and unto god would i commit my cause which doeth great things and unsearchable marvellous things withoutnumber  who giveth rain upon the earth and sendeth waters uponthe fields  to set up on high those that be low that those whichmourn may be exalted to safety he disappointeth the devices of the crafty so that their handscannot perform their enterprise he taketh the wise in their own craftiness and the counsel ofthe froward is carried headlong they meet with darkness in the day time and grope in the noondayas in the night but he saveth the poor from the sword from their mouth and fromthe hand of the mighty so the poor hath hope and iniquity stoppeth her mouth behold happy is the man whom god correcteth therefore despisenot thou the chastening of the almighty  for he maketh sore andbindeth up he woundeth and his hands make whole he shall deliver thee in six troubles yea in seven there shallno evil touch thee in famine he shall redeem thee from death and in war from thepower of the sword thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue neither shaltthou be afraid of destruction when it cometh at

grass of the earth thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age like as a shock ofcorn cometh in in his season lo this we have searched it so it is hear it and know thou itfor thy good but job answered and said  oh that my grief were throughlyweighed and my calamity laid in the balances together   for nowit would be heavier than the sand of the sea therefore my words areswallowed up for the arrows

 can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt oris there any taste in the white of an egg   the things that mysoul refused to touch are as my sorrowful meat oh that i might have my request and that god would grant me thething that i long for   even that it would please god to destroyme that he would let loose his hand and cut me off   thenshould i yet have comfort yea i would harden myself in sorrow lethim not spare for i have not concealed the words of the holy one what is my strength that i should hope and what is mine endthat i should prolong my life   is my strength the strength ofstones or is my flesh of brass   is not my help in me and iswisdom driven quite from me   to him that is afflicted pityshould be shewed from his friend but he forsaketh the fear of thealmighty my brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook and as the streamof brooks they pass away  which are blackish by reason of theice and wherein the snow is hid  what time they wax warm theyvanish when it is hot they are consumed out of their place the paths of their way are turned aside they go to nothing andperish the troops of tema looked the companies of sheba waited forthem they were confounded because they had hoped they came thitherand were ashamed for now ye are nothing ye see my casting down and are afraid did i say bring unto me or give a reward for me of yoursubstance   or deliver me from the enemys hand or redeem mefrom the hand of the mighty   teach me and i will hold mytongue and cause me to understand wherein i have erred how forcible are right words but what doth your arguing reprove do ye imagine to reprove words and the speeches of one that isdesperate which are as wind   yea ye overwhelm the fatherlessand ye dig a pit for your friend now therefore be content look upon me for it is evident untoyou if i lie return i pray you let it not be iniquity yea return again myrighteousness is in it is there iniquity in my tongue cannot my taste discern perversethings   is there not an appointed time to man upon earth are nothis days also like the days of an hireling   as a servantearnestly desireth the shadow and as an hireling looketh for thereward of his work  so am i made to possess months of vanity andwearisome nights are appointed to me when i lie down i say when shall i arise and the night be goneand i am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day my flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust my skin isbroken and become loathsome my days are swifter than a weavers shuttle and are spent withouthope o remember that my life is wind mine eye shall no more see good the eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more thine eyesare upon me and i am not as the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away so he that goeth downto the grave shall come up no more he shall return no more to his house neither shall his placeknow him any more therefore i will not refrain my mouth i will speak in theanguish of my spirit i will complain in the bitterness of my soul am i a sea or a whale that thou settest a watch over me  when i say my bed shall comfort me my couch shall ease mycomplaints  then thou scarest me with dreams and terrifiest methrough visions  so that my soul chooseth strangling and deathrather than my life i loathe it i would not live alway let me alone for my daysare vanity what is man that thou shouldest magnify him and that thoushouldest set thine heart upon him   and that thou shouldestvisit him every morning and try him every moment   how long wiltthou not depart from me nor let me alone till i swallow down myspittle   i have sinned what shall i do unto thee o thoupreserver of men  why hast thou set me as a mark against thee sothat i am a burden to myself   and why dost thou not pardon mytransgression and take away my iniquity for now shall i sleep in thedust and thou shalt seek me in the morning but i shall not be then answered bildad the shuhite and said  how long wilt thouspeak these things and how long shall the words of thy mouth be likea strong wind   doth god pervert judgment or doth the almightypervert justice   if thy children have sinned against him and hehave cast them away for their transgression  if thou wouldest seekunto god betimes and make thy supplication to the almighty  ifthou wert pure and upright surely now he would awake for thee andmake the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous though thy beginning was small yet thy latter end should greatlyincrease for enquire i pray thee of the former age and prepare thyselfto the search of their fathers  for we are but of yesterday andknow nothing because our days upon earth are a shadow  shallnot they teach thee and tell thee and utter words out of theirheart   can the rush grow up without mire can the flag growwithout water   whilst it is yet in his greenness and not cutdown it withereth before any other herb so are the paths of all that forget god and the hypocrites hopeshall perish  whose hope shall be cut off and whose trust shallbe a spiders web he shall lean upon his house but it shall not stand he shallhold it fast but it shall not endure he is green before the sun and his branch shooteth forth in hisgarden his roots are wrapped about the heap and seeth the place ofstones if he destroy him from his place then it shall deny him sayingi have not seen thee behold this is the joy of his way and out of the earth shallothers grow behold god will not cast away a perfect man neither will hehelp the evil doers  till he fill thy mouth with laughing andthy lips with rejoicing they that hate thee shall be clothed with shame and the dwellingplace of the wicked shall come to nought then job answered and said  i know it is so of a truth buthow should man be just with god   if he will contend with him hecannot answer him one of a thousand he is wise in heart and mighty in strength who hath hardenedhimself against him and hath prospered   which removeth themountains and they know not which overturneth them in his anger which shaketh the earth out of her place and the pillars thereoftremble which commandeth the sun and it riseth not and sealeth up thestars which alone spreadeth out the heavens and treadeth upon the wavesof the sea which maketh arcturus orion and pleiades and the chambers ofthe south which doeth great things past finding out yea and wonderswithout number lo he goeth by me and i see him not he passeth on also but iperceive him not behold he taketh away who can hinder him who will say untohim what doest thou   if god will not withdraw his anger theproud helpers do stoop under him how much less shall i answer him and choose out my words toreason with him   whom though i were righteous yet would i notanswer but i would make supplication to my judge if i had called and he had answered me yet would i not believethat he had hearkened unto my voice for he breaketh me with a tempest and multiplieth my woundswithout cause he will not suffer me to take my breath but filleth me withbitterness if i speak of strength lo he is strong and if of judgment whoshall set me a time to plead   if i justify myself mine ownmouth shall condemn me if i say i am perfect it shall also prove meperverse though i were perfect yet would i not know my soul i woulddespise my life this is one thing therefore i said it he destroyeth the perfectand the wicked if the scourge slay suddenly he will laugh at the trial of theinnocent the earth is given into the hand of the wicked he covereth thefaces of the judges thereof if not where and who is he   nowmy days are swifter than a post they flee away they see no good they are passed away as the swift ships as the eagle thathasteth to the prey if i say i will forget my complaint i will leave off myheaviness and comfort myself  i am afraid of all my sorrows iknow that thou wilt not hold me innocent if i be wicked why then labour i in vain   if i wash myselfwith snow water and make my hands never so clean  yet shalt thouplunge me in the ditch and mine own clothes shall abhor me for he is not a man as i am that i should answer him and weshould come together in judgment neither is there any daysman betwixt us that might lay his handupon us both let him take his rod away from me and let not his fear terrifyme  then would i speak and not fear him but it is not so withme my soul is weary of my life i will leave my complaint uponmyself i will speak in the bitterness of my soul i will say unto god do not condemn me shew me wherefore thoucontendest with me is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress that thoushouldest despise the work of thine hands and shine upon the counselof the wicked   hast thou eyes of flesh or seest thou as manseeth   are thy days as the days of man are thy years as mansdays  that thou enquirest after mine iniquity and searchestafter my sin   thou knowest that i am not wicked and there isnone that can deliver out of thine hand thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round aboutyet thou dost destroy me remember i beseech thee that thou hast made me as the clay andwilt thou bring me into dust again   hast thou not poured me outas milk and curdled me like cheese   thou hast clothed me withskin and flesh and hast fenced me with bones and sinews thou hast granted me life and favour and thy visitation hathpreserved my spirit and these things hast thou hid in thine heart i know that thisis with thee if i sin then thou markest me and thou wilt not acquit me frommine iniquity if i be wicked woe unto me and if i be righteous yet will inot lift up my head i am full of confusion therefore see thou mineaffliction  for it increaseth thou huntest me as a fierce lionand again thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me thou renewest thy witnesses against me and increasest thineindignation upon me changes and war are against me wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb ohthat i had given up the ghost and no eye had seen me   i shouldhave been as though i had not been i should have been carried fromthe womb to the grave are not my days few cease then and let me alone that i maytake comfort a little  before i go whence i shall not returneven to the land of darkness and the shadow of death  a land ofdarkness as darkness itself and of the shadow of death without anyorder and where the light is as darkness then answered zophar the naamathite and said  should notthe multitude of words be answered and should a man full of talk bejustified   should thy lies make men hold their peace and whenthou mockest shall no man make thee ashamed   for thou hastsaid my doctrine is pure and i am clean in thine eyes but oh that god would speak and open his lips against thee and that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom that they aredouble to that which is know therefore that god exacteth of thee lessthan thine iniquity deserveth canst thou by searching find out god canst thou find out thealmighty unto perfection   it is as high as heaven what canstthou do deeper than hell what canst thou know   the measurethereof is longer than the earth and broader than the sea if he cut off and shut up or gather together then who canhinder him   for he knoweth vain men he seeth wickedness alsowill he not then consider it   for vain men would be wisethough man be born like a wild asss colt if thou prepare thine heart and stretch out thine hands towardhim  if iniquity be in thine hand put it far away and let notwickedness dwell in thy tabernacles for then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot yea thoushalt be stedfast and shalt not fear  because thou shalt forgetthy misery and remember it as waters that pass away  and thineage shall be clearer than the noonday thou shalt shine forth thoushalt be as the morning and thou shalt be secure because there is hope yea thou shaltdig about thee and thou shalt take thy rest in safety also thou shalt lie down and none shall make thee afraid yeamany shall make suit unto thee but the eyes of the wicked shall fail and they shall notescape and their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghost and job answered and said  no doubt but ye are the peopleand wisdom shall die with you but i have understanding as well as you i am not inferior toyou yea who knoweth not such things as these   i am as onemocked of his neighbour who calleth upon god and he answereth himthe just upright man is laughed to scorn he that is ready to slip with his feet is as a lamp despised inthe thought of him that is at ease the tabernacles of robbers prosper and they that provoke god aresecure into whose hand god bringeth abundantly but ask now the beasts and they shall teach thee and the fowlsof the air and they shall tell thee  or speak to the earth andit shall teach thee and the fishes of the sea shall declare untothee who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the lord hathwrought this   in whose hand is the soul of every living thingand the breath of all mankind doth not the ear try words and the mouth taste his meat  with the ancient is wisdom and in length of days understanding with him is wisdom and strength he hath counsel andunderstanding behold he breaketh down and it cannot be built again heshutteth up a man and there can be no opening behold he withholdeth the waters and they dry up also hesendeth them out and they overturn the earth with him is strength and wisdom the deceived and the deceiverare his he leadeth counsellors away spoiled and maketh the judgesfools he looseth the bond of kings and girdeth their loins with agirdle he leadeth princes away spoiled and overthroweth the mighty he removeth away the speech of the trusty and taketh away theunderstanding of the aged he poureth contempt upon princes and weakeneth the strength ofthe mighty he discovereth deep things out of darkness and bringeth out tolight the shadow of death he increaseth the nations and destroyeth them he enlargeth thenations and straiteneth them again he taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of theearth and causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is noway they grope in the dark without light and he maketh them tostagger like a drunken man lo mine eye hath seen all this mine ear hath heard andunderstood it what ye know the same do i know also i am not inferior untoyou surely i would speak to the almighty and i desire to reason withgod but ye are forgers of lies ye are all physicians of no value o that ye would altogether hold your peace and it should be yourwisdom hear now my reasoning and hearken to the pleadings of my lips will ye speak wickedly for god and talk deceitfully for him will ye accept his person will ye contend for god   is itgood that he should search you out or as one man mocketh another doye so mock him   he will surely reprove you if ye do secretlyaccept persons shall not his excellency make you afraid and his dread fallupon you   your remembrances are like unto ashes your bodies tobodies of clay hold your peace let me alone that i may speak and let come onme what will wherefore do i take my flesh in my teeth and put my life inmine hand   though he slay me yet will i trust in him but iwill maintain mine own ways before him he also shall be my salvation for an hypocrite shall not comebefore him hear diligently my speech and my declaration with your ears behold now i have ordered my cause i know that i shall bejustified who is he that will plead with me for now if i hold my tonguei shall give up the ghost only do not two things unto me then will i not hide myself fromthee withdraw thine hand far from me and let not thy dread make meafraid then call thou and i will answer or let me speak and answerthou me how many are mine iniquities and sins make me to know mytransgression and my sin wherefore hidest thou thy face and holdest me for thine enemy wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro and wilt thou pursuethe dry stubble   for thou writest bitter things against me andmakest me to possess the iniquities of my youth thou puttest my feet also in the stocks and lookest narrowlyunto all my paths thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet and he as a rotten thing consumeth as a garment that is motheaten man that is born of a woman is of few days and full of trouble he cometh forth like a flower and is cut down he fleeth also asa shadow and continueth not and doth thou open thine eyes upon such an one and bringest meinto judgment with thee   who can bring a clean thing out of anunclean not one seeing his days are determined the number of his months are withthee thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass  turnfrom him that he may rest till he shall accomplish as an hirelinghis day for there is hope of a tree if it be cut down that it willsprout again and that the tender branch thereof will not cease though the root thereof wax old in the earth and the stockthereof die in the ground  yet through the scent of water it willbud and bring forth boughs like a plant but man dieth and wasteth away yea man giveth up the ghostand where is he   as the waters fail from the sea and the flooddecayeth and drieth up  so man lieth down and riseth not tillthe heavens be no more they shall not awake nor be raised out oftheir sleep o that thou wouldest hide me in the grave that thou wouldestkeep me secret until thy wrath be past that thou wouldest appoint mea set time and remember me   if a man die shall he live againall the days of my appointed time will i wait till my change come thou shalt call and i will answer thee thou wilt have a desireto the work of thine hands for now thou numberest my steps dost thou not watch over mysin   my transgression is sealed up in a bag and thou sewest upmine iniquity and surely the mountains falling cometh to nought and the rockis removed out of his place the waters wear the stones thou washest away the things whichgrow out of the dust of the earth and thou destroyest the hope ofman thou prevailest for ever against him and he passeth thouchangest his countenance and sendest him away his sons come to honour and he knoweth it not and they arebrought low but he perceiveth it not of them but his flesh upon him shall have pain and his soul within himshall mourn then answered eliphaz the temanite and said  should a wiseman utter vain knowledge and fill his belly with the east wind  should he reason with unprofitable talk or with speeches wherewith hecan do no good   yea thou castest off fear and restrainestprayer before god for thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity and thou choosest thetongue of the crafty thine own mouth condemneth thee and not i yea thine own lipstestify against thee art thou the first man that was born or wast thou made beforethe hills   hast thou heard the secret of god and dost thourestrain wisdom to thyself   what knowest thou that we know notwhat understandest thou which is not in us   with us are boththe grayheaded and very aged men much elder than thy father are the consolations of god small with thee is there any secretthing with thee   why doth thine heart carry thee away and whatdo thy eyes wink at  that thou turnest thy spirit against godand lettest such words go out of thy mouth   what is man thathe should be clean and he which is born of a woman that he should berighteous   behold he putteth no trust in his saints yea theheavens are not clean in his sight how much more abominable and filthy is man which drinkethiniquity like water   i will shew thee hear me and that whichi have seen i will declare  which wise men have told from theirfathers and have not hid it  unto whom alone the earth wasgiven and no stranger passed among them the wicked man travaileth with pain all his days and the numberof years is hidden to the oppressor a dreadful sound is in his ears in prosperity the destroyershall come upon him he believeth not that he shall return out of darkness and he iswaited for of the sword he wandereth abroad for bread saying where is it he knoweththat the day of darkness is ready at his hand trouble and anguish shall make him afraid they shall prevailagainst him as a king ready to the battle for he stretcheth out his hand against god and strengthenethhimself against the almighty he runneth upon him even on his neck upon the thick bosses ofhis bucklers  because he covereth his face with his fatness andmaketh collops of fat on his flanks and he dwelleth in desolate cities and in houses which no maninhabiteth which are ready to become heaps he shall not be rich neither shall his substance continueneither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth he shall not depart out of darkness the flame shall dry up hisbranches and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away let not him that is deceived trust in vanity for vanity shallbe his recompence it shall be accomplished before his time and his branch shallnot be green he shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine and shall castoff his flower as the olive for the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate and fireshall consume the tabernacles of bribery they conceive mischief and bring forth vanity and their bellyprepareth deceit then job answered and said  i have heard many such thingsmiserable comforters are ye all shall vain words have an end or what emboldeneth thee that thouanswerest   i also could speak as ye do if your soul were in mysouls stead i could heap up words against you and shake mine headat you but i would strengthen you with my mouth and the moving of mylips should asswage your grief though i speak my grief is not asswaged and though i forbearwhat am i eased   but now he hath made me weary thou hast madedesolate all my company and thou hast filled me with wrinkles which is a witness againstme and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face he teareth me in his wrath who hateth me he gnasheth upon mewith his teeth mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me they have gaped upon me with their mouth they have smitten meupon the cheek reproachfully they have gathered themselves togetheragainst me god hath delivered me to the ungodly and turned me over intothe hands of the wicked i was at ease but he hath broken me asunder he hath also takenme by my neck and shaken me to pieces and set me up for his mark his archers compass me round about he cleaveth my reinsasunder and doth not spare he poureth out my gall upon the ground he breaketh me with breach upon breach he runneth upon me likea giant i have sewed sackcloth upon my skin and defiled my horn in thedust my face is foul with weeping and on my eyelids is the shadow ofdeath  not for any injustice in mine hands also my prayer ispure o earth cover not thou my blood and let my cry have no place also now behold my witness is in heaven and my record is onhigh my friends scorn me but mine eye poureth out tears unto god o that one might plead for a man with god as a man pleadeth forhis neighbour   when a few years are come then i shall go theway whence i shall not return my breath is corrupt my days are extinct the graves are readyfor me are there not mockers with me and doth not mine eye continue intheir provocation   lay down now put me in a surety with theewho is he that will strike hands with me   for thou hast hidtheir heart from understanding therefore shalt thou not exalt them he that speaketh flattery to his friends even the eyes of hischildren shall fail he hath made me also a byword of the people and aforetime i wasas a tabret mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow and all my members areas a shadow upright men shall be astonied at this and the innocent shallstir up himself against the hypocrite the righteous also shall hold on his way and he that hath cleanhands shall be stronger and stronger but as for you all do ye return and come now for i cannotfind one wise man among you my days are past my purposes are broken off even the thoughtsof my heart they change the night into day the light is short because ofdarkness if i wait the grave is mine house i have made my bed in thedarkness i have said to corruption thou art my father to the worm thouart my mother and my sister and where is now my hope as for my hope who shall see it they shall go down to the bars of the pit when our resttogether is in the dust then answered bildad the shuhite and said  how long will itbe ere ye make an end of words mark and afterwards we will speak wherefore are we counted as beasts and reputed vile in yoursight   he teareth himself in his anger shall the earth beforsaken for thee and shall the rock be removed out of his place yea the light of the wicked shall be put out and the spark ofhis fire shall not shine the light shall be dark in his tabernacle and his candle shallbe put out with him the steps of his strength shall be straitened and his owncounsel shall cast him down for he is cast into a net by his own feet and he walketh upon asnare the gin shall take him by the heel and the robber shall prevailagainst him the snare is laid for him in the ground and a trap for him inthe way terrors shall make him afraid on every side and shall drive himto his feet his strength shall be hungerbitten and destruction shall beready at his side it shall devour the strength of his skin even the firstborn ofdeath shall devour his strength his confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle and itshall bring him to the king of terrors it shall dwell in his tabernacle because it is none of hisbrimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation his roots shall be dried up beneath and above shall his branchbe cut off his remembrance shall perish from the earth and he shall haveno name in the street he shall be driven from light into darkness and chased out ofthe world he shall neither have son nor nephew among his people nor anyremaining in his dwellings they that come after him shall be astonied at his day as theythat went before were affrighted surely such are the dwellings of the wicked and this is theplace of him that knoweth not god then job answered and said  how long will ye vex my souland break me in pieces with words   these ten times have yereproached me ye are not ashamed that ye make yourselves strange tome and be it indeed that i have erred mine error remaineth withmyself if indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me and pleadagainst me my reproach  know now that god hath overthrown me andhath compassed me with his net behold i cry out of wrong but i am not heard i cry aloud butthere is no judgment he hath fenced up my way that i cannot pass and he hath setdarkness in my paths he hath stripped me of my glory and taken the crown from myhead he hath destroyed me on every side and i am gone and mine hopehath he removed like a tree he hath also kindled his wrath against me and he counteth meunto him as one of his enemies his troops come together and raise up their way against me andencamp round about my tabernacle he hath put my brethren far from me and mine acquaintance areverily estranged from me my kinsfolk have failed and my familiar friends have forgottenme they that dwell in mine house and my maids count me for astranger i am an alien in their sight i called my servant and he gave me no answer i intreated himwith my mouth my breath is strange to my wife though i intreated for thechildrens sake of mine own body yea young children despised me i arose and they spake againstme all my inward friends abhorred me and they whom i loved areturned against me my bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh and i am escapedwith the skin of my teeth have pity upon me have pity upon me o ye my friends for thehand of god hath touched me why do ye persecute me as god and are not satisfied with myflesh   oh that my words were now written oh that they wereprinted in a book   that they were graven with an iron pen andlead in the rock for ever   for i know that my redeemer livethand that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth  andthough after my skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall isee god  whom i shall see for myself and mine eyes shallbehold and not another though my reins be consumed within me but ye should say why persecute we him seeing the root of thematter is found in me   be ye afraid of the sword for wrathbringeth the punishments of the sword that ye may know there is ajudgment then answered zophar the naamathite and said  therefore domy thoughts cause me to answer and for this i make haste i have heard the check of my reproach and the spirit of myunderstanding causeth me to answer knowest thou not this of old since man was placed upon earth that the triumphing of the wicked is short and the joy of thehypocrite but for a moment   though his excellency mount up tothe heavens and his head reach unto the clouds  yet he shallperish for ever like his own dung they which have seen him shall saywhere is he   he shall fly away as a dream and shall not befound yea he shall be chased away as a vision of the night the eye also which saw him shall see him no more neither shallhis place any more behold him his children shall seek to please the poor and his hands shallrestore their goods his bones are full of the sin of his youth which shall lie downwith him in the dust though wickedness be sweet in his mouth though he hide it underhis tongue  though he spare it and forsake it not but keep itstill within his mouth  yet his meat in his bowels is turned itis the gall of asps within him he hath swallowed down riches and he shall vomit them up againgod shall cast them out of his belly he shall suck the poison of asps the vipers tongue shall slayhim he shall not see the rivers the floods the brooks of honey andbutter that which he laboured for shall he restore and shall notswallow it down according to his substance shall the restitution beand he shall not rejoice therein because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor because hehath violently taken away an house which he builded not  surelyhe shall not feel quietness in his belly he shall not save of thatwhich he desired there shall none of his meat be left therefore shall no manlook for his goods in the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits everyhand of the wicked shall come upon him when he is about to fill his belly god shall cast the fury ofhis wrath upon him and shall rain it upon him while he is eating he shall flee from the iron weapon and the bow of steel shallstrike him through it is drawn and cometh out of the body yea the glitteringsword cometh out of his gall terrors are upon him all darkness shall be hid in his secret places a fire not blownshall consume him it shall go ill with him that is left in histabernacle the heaven shall reveal his iniquity and the earth shall riseup against him the increase of his house shall depart and his goods shall flowaway in the day of his wrath this is the portion of a wicked man from god and the heritageappointed unto him by god but job answered and said  hear diligently my speech andlet this be your consolations suffer me that i may speak and after that i have spoken mockon as for me is my complaint to man and if it were so why shouldnot my spirit be troubled   mark me and be astonished and layyour hand upon your mouth even when i remember i am afraid and trembling taketh hold on myflesh wherefore do the wicked live become old yea are mighty inpower   their seed is established in their sight with them andtheir offspring before their eyes their houses are safe from fear neither is the rod of god uponthem their bull gendereth and faileth not their cow calveth andcasteth not her calf they send forth their little ones like a flock and theirchildren dance they take the timbrel and harp and rejoice at the sound of theorgan they spend their days in wealth and in a moment go down to thegrave therefore they say unto god depart from us for we desire notthe knowledge of thy ways what is the almighty that we should serve him and what profitshould we have if we pray unto him   lo their good is not intheir hand the counsel of the wicked is far from me how oft is the candle of the wicked put out and how oft comeththeir destruction upon them god distributeth sorrows in his anger they are as stubble before the wind and as chaff that the stormcarrieth away god layeth up his iniquity for his children he rewardeth himand he shall know it his eyes shall see his destruction and he shall drink of thewrath of the almighty for what pleasure hath he in his house after him when thenumber of his months is cut off in the midst   shall any teachgod knowledge seeing he judgeth those that are high one dieth in his full strength being wholly at ease and quiet his breasts are full of milk and his bones are moistened withmarrow and another dieth in the bitterness of his soul and nevereateth with pleasure they shall lie down alike in the dust and the worms shall coverthem behold i know your thoughts and the devices which yewrongfully imagine against me for ye say where is the house of the prince and where are thedwelling places of the wicked   have ye not asked them that goby the way and do ye not know their tokens  that the wicked isreserved to the day of destruction they shall be brought forth to theday of wrath who shall declare his way to his face and who shall repay himwhat he hath done   yet shall he be brought to the grave andshall remain in the tomb the clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him and every manshall draw after him as there are innumerable before him how then comfort ye me in vain seeing in your answers thereremaineth falsehood   then eliphaz the temanite answered andsaid  can a man be profitable unto god as he that is wise may beprofitable unto himself   is it any pleasure to the almightythat thou art righteous or is it gain to him that thou makest thyways perfect   will he reprove thee for fear of thee will heenter with thee into judgment   is not thy wickedness great andthine iniquities infinite   for thou hast taken a pledge from thybrother for nought and stripped the naked of their clothing thou hast not given water to the weary to drink and thou hastwithholden bread from the hungry but as for the mighty man he had the earth and the honourableman dwelt in it thou hast sent widows away empty and the arms of the fatherlesshave been broken therefore snares are round about thee and sudden fear troubleththee  or darkness that thou canst not see and abundance ofwaters cover thee is not god in the height of heaven and behold the height of thestars how high they are   and thou sayest how doth god knowcan he judge through the dark cloud   thick clouds are acovering to him that he seeth not and he walketh in the circuit ofheaven hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden which were cut down out of time whose foundation was overflownwith a flood  which said unto god depart from us and what canthe almighty do for them   yet he filled their houses with goodthings but the counsel of the wicked is far from me the righteous see it and are glad and the innocent laugh themto scorn whereas our substance is not cut down but the remnant of themthe fire consumeth acquaint now thyself with him and be at peace thereby goodshall come unto thee receive i pray thee the law from his mouth and lay up hiswords in thine heart if thou return to the almighty thou shalt be built up thoushalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles then shalt thou lay up gold as dust and the gold of ophir asthe stones of the brooks yea the almighty shall be thy defence and thou shalt haveplenty of silver for then shalt thou have thy delight in the almighty and shaltlift up thy face unto god thou shalt make thy prayer unto him and he shall hear thee andthou shalt pay thy vows thou shalt also decree a thing and it shall be established untothee and the light shall shine upon thy ways when men are cast down then thou shalt say there is liftingup and he shall save the humble person he shall deliver the island of the innocent and it is deliveredby the pureness of thine hands then job answered and said  even to day is my complaintbitter my stroke is heavier than my groaning oh that i knew where i might find him that i might come even tohis seat   i would order my cause before him and fill my mouthwith arguments i would know the words which he would answer me and understandwhat he would say unto me will he plead against me with his great power no but he wouldput strength in me there the righteous might dispute with him so should i bedelivered for ever from my judge behold i go forward but he is not there and backward but icannot perceive him  on the left hand where he doth work but icannot behold him he hideth himself on the right hand that i cannotsee him  but he knoweth the way that i take when he hath triedme i shall come forth as gold my foot hath held his steps his way have i kept and notdeclined neither have i gone back from the commandment of his lips ihave esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food but he is in one mind and who can turn him and what his souldesireth even that he doeth for he performeth the thing that is appointed for me and manysuch things are with him therefore am i troubled at his presence when i consider i amafraid of him for god maketh my heart soft and the almighty troubleth me because i was not cut off before the darkness neither hath hecovered the darkness from my face why seeing times are not hidden from the almighty do they thatknow him not see his days   some remove the landmarks theyviolently take away flocks and feed thereof they drive away the ass of the fatherless they take the widowsox for a pledge they turn the needy out of the way the poor of the earth hidethemselves together behold as wild asses in the desert go they forth to their workrising betimes for a prey the wilderness yieldeth food for them andfor their children they reap every one his corn in the field and they gather thevintage of the wicked they cause the naked to lodge without clothing that they have nocovering in the cold they are wet with the showers of the mountains and embrace therock for want of a shelter they pluck the fatherless from the breast and take a pledge ofthe poor they cause him to go naked without clothing and they take awaythe sheaf from the hungry  which make oil within their wallsand tread their winepresses and suffer thirst men groan from out of the city and the soul of the woundedcrieth out yet god layeth not folly to them they are of those that rebel against the light they know notthe ways thereof nor abide in the paths thereof the murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needyand in the night is as a thief the eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight sayingno eye shall see me and disguiseth his face in the dark they dig through houses which they had marked forthemselves in the daytime they know not the light for the morning is to them even as the shadow of death if oneknow them they are in the terrors of the shadow of death he is swift as the waters their portion is cursed in the earthhe beholdeth not the way of the vineyards drought and heat consume the snow waters so doth the gravethose which have sinned the womb shall forget him the worm shall feed sweetly on himhe shall be no more remembered and wickedness shall be broken as atree he evil entreateth the barren that beareth not and doeth notgood to the widow he draweth also the mighty with his power he riseth up and noman is sure of life though it be given him to be in safety whereon he resteth yethis eyes are upon their ways they are exalted for a little while but are gone and broughtlow they are taken out of the way as all other and cut off as thetops of the ears of corn and if it be not so now who will make me a liar and make myspeech nothing worth   then answered bildad the shuhite andsaid  dominion and fear are with him he maketh peace in his highplaces is there any number of his armies and upon whom doth not hislight arise   how then can man be justified with god or how canhe be clean that is born of a woman   behold even to the moonand it shineth not yea the stars are not pure in his sight how much less man that is a worm and the son of man which is aworm   but job answered and said  how hast thou helped himthat is without power how savest thou the arm that hath no strength how hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom and how hastthou plentifully declared the thing as it is   to whom hast thouuttered words and whose spirit came from thee   dead things areformed from under the waters and the inhabitants thereof hell is naked before him and destruction hath no covering he stretcheth out the north over the empty place and hangeth theearth upon nothing he bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds and the cloud isnot rent under them he holdeth back the face of his throne and spreadeth his cloudupon it he hath compassed the waters with bounds until the day andnight come to an end the pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof he divideth the sea with his power and by his understanding hesmiteth through the proud by his spirit he hath garnished the heavens his hand hathformed the crooked serpent lo these are parts of his ways but how little a portion isheard of him but the thunder of his power who can understand  moreover job continued his parable and said  as god liveth whohath taken away my judgment and the almighty who hath vexed my soul all the while my breath is in me and the spirit of god is in mynostrils  my lips shall not speak wickedness nor my tongue utterdeceit god forbid that i should justify you till i die i will notremove mine integrity from me my righteousness i hold fast and will not let it go my heartshall not reproach me so long as i live let mine enemy be as the wicked and he that riseth up against meas the unrighteous for what is the hope of the hypocrite though he hath gainedwhen god taketh away his soul   will god hear his cry whentrouble cometh upon him   will he delight himself in thealmighty will he always call upon god   i will teach you by thehand of god that which is with the almighty will i not conceal behold all ye yourselves have seen it why then are ye thusaltogether vain   this is the portion of a wicked man with godand the heritage of oppressors which they shall receive of thealmighty if his children be multiplied it is for the sword and hisoffspring shall not be satisfied with bread those that remain of him shall be buried in death and hiswidows shall not weep though he heap up silver as the dust and prepare raiment as theclay  he may prepare it but the just shall put it on and theinnocent shall divide the silver he buildeth his house as a moth and as a booth that the keepermaketh the rich man shall lie down but he shall not be gathered heopeneth his eyes and he is not terrors take hold on him as waters a tempest stealeth him awayin the night the east wind carrieth him away and he departeth and as astorm hurleth him out of his place for god shall cast upon him and not spare he would fain fleeout of his hand men shall clap their hands at him and shall hiss him out of hisplace surely there is a vein for the silver and a place for gold wherethey fine it iron is taken out of the earth and brass is molten out of thestone he setteth an end to darkness and searcheth out all perfectionthe stones of darkness and the shadow of death the flood breaketh out from the inhabitant even the watersforgotten of the foot they are dried up they are gone away from men as for the earth out of it cometh bread and under it is turnedup as it were fire the stones of it are the place of sapphires and it hath dust ofgold there is a path which no fowl knoweth and which the vultureseye hath not seen  the lions whelps have not trodden it nor thefierce lion passed by it he putteth forth his hand upon the rock he overturneth themountains by the roots he cutteth out rivers among the rocks and his eye seeth everyprecious thing he bindeth the floods from overflowing and the thing that ishid bringeth he forth to light but where shall wisdom be found and where is the place ofunderstanding   man knoweth not the price thereof neither is itfound in the land of the living the depth saith it is not in me and the sea saith it is notwith me it cannot be gotten for gold neither shall silver be weighedfor the price thereof it cannot be valued with the gold of ophir with the preciousonyx or the sapphire the gold and the crystal cannot equal it and the exchange of itshall not be for jewels of fine gold no mention shall be made of coral or of pearls for the priceof wisdom is above rubies the topaz of ethiopia shall not equal it neither shall it bevalued with pure gold whence then cometh wisdom and where is the place ofunderstanding   seeing it is hid from the eyes of all livingand kept close from the fowls of the air destruction and death say we have heard the fame thereof withour ears god understandeth the way thereof and he knoweth the placethereof for he looketh to the ends of the earth and seeth under thewhole heaven  to make the weight for the winds and he weigheththe waters by measure when he made a decree for the rain and a way for the lightningof the thunder  then did he see it and declare it he preparedit yea and searched it out and unto man he said behold the fear of the lord that iswisdom and to depart from evil is understanding moreover job continued his parable and said  oh that i wereas in months past as in the days when god preserved me  when hiscandle shined upon my head and when by his light i walked throughdarkness  as i was in the days of my youth when the secret ofgod was upon my tabernacle  when the almighty was yet with mewhen my children were about me  when i washed my steps withbutter and the rock poured me out rivers of oil  when i went outto the gate through the city when i prepared my seat in the street the young men saw me and hid themselves and the aged arose andstood up the princes refrained talking and laid their hand on theirmouth the nobles held their peace and their tongue cleaved to theroof of their mouth when the ear heard me then it blessed me and when the eye sawme it gave witness to me  because i delivered the poor thatcried and the fatherless and him that had none to help him the blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me and icaused the widows heart to sing for joy i put on righteousness and it clothed me my judgment was as arobe and a diadem i was eyes to the blind and feet was i to the lame i was a father to the poor and the cause which i knew not isearched out and i brake the jaws of the wicked and plucked the spoil out ofhis teeth then i said i shall die in my nest and i shall multiply mydays as the sand my root was spread out by the waters and the dew lay all nightupon my branch my glory was fresh in me and my bow was renewed in my hand unto me men gave ear and waited and kept silence at mycounsel after my words they spake not again and my speech dropped uponthem and they waited for me as for the rain and they opened theirmouth wide as for the latter rain if i laughed on them they believed it not and the light of mycountenance they cast not down i chose out their way and sat chief and dwelt as a king in thearmy as one that comforteth the mourners but now they that are younger than i have me in derision whosefathers i would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock yea whereto might the strength of their hands profit me in whomold age was perished   for want and famine they were solitaryfleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste who cut up mallows by the bushes and juniper roots for theirmeat they were driven forth from among men they cried after them asafter a thief  to dwell in the cliffs of the valleys in cavesof the earth and in the rocks among the bushes they brayed under the nettles they weregathered together they were children of fools yea children of base men they wereviler than the earth and now am i their song yea i am their byword they abhor me they flee far from me and spare not to spit inmy face because he hath loosed my cord and afflicted me they have alsolet loose the bridle before me upon my right hand rise the youth they push away my feet andthey raise up against me the ways of their destruction they mar my path they set forward my calamity they have nohelper they came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters in thedesolation they rolled themselves upon me terrors are turned upon me they pursue my soul as the wind andmy welfare passeth away as a cloud and now my soul is poured out upon me the days of afflictionhave taken hold upon me my bones are pierced in me in the night season and my sinewstake no rest by the great force of my disease is my garment changed itbindeth me about as the collar of my coat he hath cast me into the mire and i am become like dust andashes i cry unto thee and thou dost not hear me i stand up and thouregardest me not thou art become cruel to me with thy strong hand thou opposestthyself against me thou liftest me up to the wind thou causest me to ride upon itand dissolvest my substance for i know that thou wilt bring me to death and to the houseappointed for all living howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave thoughthey cry in his destruction did not i weep for him that was in trouble was not my soulgrieved for the poor   when i looked for good then evil cameunto me and when i waited for light there came darkness my bowels boiled and rested not the days of afflictionprevented me i went mourning without the sun i stood up and i cried in thecongregation i am a brother to dragons and a companion to owls my skin is black upon me and my bones are burned with heat my harp also is turned to mourning and my organ into the voiceof them that weep i made a covenant with mine eyes why then should i think upon amaid   for what portion of god is there from above and whatinheritance of the almighty from on high   is not destruction tothe wicked and a strange punishment to the workers of iniquity  doth not he see my ways and count all my steps   if i havewalked with vanity or if my foot hath hasted to deceit  let mebe weighed in an even balance that god may know mine integrity if my step hath turned out of the way and mine heart walkedafter mine eyes and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands  thenlet me sow and let another eat yea let my offspring be rooted out if mine heart have been deceived by a woman or if i have laidwait at my neighbours door  then let my wife grind untoanother and let others bow down upon her for this is an heinous crime yea it is an iniquity to bepunished by the judges for it is a fire that consumeth to destruction and would rootout all mine increase if i did despise the cause of my manservant or of mymaidservant when they contended with me  what then shall i dowhen god riseth up and when he visiteth what shall i answer him did not he that made me in the womb make him and did not onefashion us in the womb   if i have withheld the poor from theirdesire or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail  or haveeaten my morsel myself alone and the fatherless hath not eatenthereof  for from my youth he was brought up with me as with afather and i have guided her from my mothers womb  if i haveseen any perish for want of clothing or any poor without covering if his loins have not blessed me and if he were not warmed withthe fleece of my sheep  if i have lifted up my hand against thefatherless when i saw my help in the gate  then let mine armfall from my shoulder blade and mine arm be broken from the bone for destruction from god was a terror to me and by reason ofhis highness i could not endure if i have made gold my hope or have said to the fine gold thouart my confidence  if i rejoice because my wealth was great andbecause mine hand had gotten much  if i beheld the sun when itshined or the moon walking in brightness  and my heart hathbeen secretly enticed or my mouth hath kissed my hand  thisalso were an iniquity to be punished by the judge for i should havedenied the god that is above if i rejoice at the destruction of him that hated me or liftedup myself when evil found him  neither have i suffered my mouthto sin by wishing a curse to his soul if the men of my tabernacle said not oh that we had of hisflesh  we cannot be satisfied the stranger did not lodge in the street but i opened my doorsto the traveller if i covered my transgressions as adam by hiding mine iniquityin my bosom  did i fear a great multitude or did the contemptof families terrify me that i kept silence and went not out of thedoor   oh that one would hear me behold my desire is that thealmighty would answer me and that mine adversary had written a book surely i would take it upon my shoulder and bind it as a crownto me i would declare unto him the number of my steps as a princewould i go near unto him if my land cry against me or that the furrows likewise thereofcomplain  if i have eaten the fruits thereof without money orhave caused the owners thereof to lose their life  let thistlesgrow instead of wheat and cockle instead of barleythe words of job are ended so these three men ceased to answer job because he was righteousin his own eyes then was kindled the wrath of elihu the son of barachel thebuzite of the kindred of ram against job was his wrath kindledbecause he justified himself rather than god also against his three friends was his wrath kindled becausethey had found no answer and yet had condemned job now elihu had waited till job had spoken because they were elderthan he when elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of thesethree men then his wrath was kindled and elihu the son of barachel the buzite answered and said i amyoung and ye are very old wherefore i was afraid and durst not shewyou mine opinion i said days should speak and multitude of years should teachwisdom but there is a spirit in man and the inspiration of the almightygiveth them understanding great men are not always wise neither do the aged understandjudgment therefore i said hearken to me i also will shew mine opinion behold i waited for your words i gave ear to your reasonswhilst ye searched out what to say yea i attended unto you and behold there was none of youthat convinced job or that answered his words  lest ye shouldsay we have found out wisdom god thrusteth him down not man now he hath not directed his words against me neither will ianswer him with your speeches they were amazed they answered no more they left off speaking when i had waited for they spake not but stood still andanswered no more  i said i will answer also my part i alsowill shew mine opinion for i am full of matter the spirit within me constraineth me behold my belly is as wine which hath no vent it is ready toburst like new bottles i will speak that i may be refreshed i will open my lips andanswer let me not i pray you accept any mans person neither let megive flattering titles unto man for i know not to give flattering titles in so doing my makerwould soon take me away wherefore job i pray thee hear my speeches and hearken to allmy words behold now i have opened my mouth my tongue hath spoken in mymouth my words shall be of the uprightness of my heart and my lipsshall utter knowledge clearly the spirit of god hath made me and the breath of the almightyhath given me life if thou canst answer me set thy words in order before me standup behold i am according to thy wish in gods stead i also amformed out of the clay behold my terror shall not make thee afraid neither shall myhand be heavy upon thee surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing and i have heard thevoice of thy words saying  i am clean without transgression iam innocent neither is there iniquity in me behold he findeth occasions against me he counteth me for hisenemy  he putteth my feet in the stocks he marketh all mypaths behold in this thou art not just i will answer thee that godis greater than man why dost thou strive against him for he giveth not account ofany of his matters for god speaketh once yea twice yet man perceiveth it not in a dream in a vision of the night when deep sleep fallethupon men in slumberings upon the bed  then he openeth the earsof men and sealeth their instruction  that he may withdraw manfrom his purpose and hide pride from man he keepeth back his soul from the pit and his life fromperishing by the sword he is chastened also with pain upon his bed and the multitudeof his bones with strong pain  so that his life abhorreth breadand his soul dainty meat his flesh is consumed away that it cannot be seen and hisbones that were not seen stick out yea his soul draweth near unto the grave and his life to thedestroyers if there be a messenger with him an interpreter one among athousand to shew unto man his uprightness  then he is graciousunto him and saith deliver him from going down to the pit i havefound a ransom his flesh shall be fresher than a childs he shall return tothe days of his youth  he shall pray unto god and he will befavourable unto him and he shall see his face with joy for he willrender unto man his righteousness he looketh upon men and if any say i have sinned andperverted that which was right and it profited me not  he willdeliver his soul from going into the pit and his life shall see thelight lo all these things worketh god oftentimes with man  tobring back his soul from the pit to be enlightened with the light ofthe living mark well o job hearken unto me hold thy peace and i willspeak if thou hast anything to say answer me speak for i desire tojustify thee if not hearken unto me hold thy peace and i shall teach theewisdom furthermore elihu answered and said  hear my words o yewise men and give ear unto me ye that have knowledge for the ear trieth words as the mouth tasteth meat let us choose to us judgment let us know among ourselves what isgood for job hath said i am righteous and god hath taken away myjudgment should i lie against my right my wound is incurable withouttransgression what man is like job who drinketh up scorning like water  which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity and walketh withwicked men for he hath said it profiteth a man nothing that he shoulddelight himself with god therefore hearken unto me ye men of understanding far be itfrom god that he should do wickedness and from the almighty that heshould commit iniquity for the work of a man shall he render unto him and cause everyman to find according to his ways yea surely god will not do wickedly neither will the almightypervert judgment who hath given him a charge over the earth or who hath disposedthe whole world   if he set his heart upon man if he gatherunto himself his spirit and his breath  all flesh shall perishtogether and man shall turn again unto dust if now thou hast understanding hear this hearken to the voiceof my words shall even he that hateth right govern and wilt thou condemnhim that is most just   is it fit to say to a king thou artwicked and to princes ye are ungodly   how much less to himthat accepteth not the persons of princes nor regardeth the rich morethan the poor for they all are the work of his hands in a moment shall they die and the people shall be troubled atmidnight and pass away and the mighty shall be taken away withouthand for his eyes are upon the ways of man and he seeth all hisgoings there is no darkness nor shadow of death where the workers ofiniquity may hide themselves for he will not lay upon man more than right that he shouldenter into judgment with god he shall break in pieces mighty men without number and setothers in their stead therefore he knoweth their works and he overturneth them in thenight so that they are destroyed he striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others because they turned back from him and would not consider any ofhis ways  so that they cause the cry of the poor to come untohim and he heareth the cry of the afflicted when he giveth quietness who then can make trouble and when hehideth his face who then can behold him whether it be done against anation or against a man only  that the hypocrite reign notlest the people be ensnared surely it is meet to be said unto god i have bornechastisement i will not offend any more  that which i see notteach thou me if i have done iniquity i will do no more should it be according to thy mind he will recompense itwhether thou refuse or whether thou choose and not i thereforespeak what thou knowest let men of understanding tell me and let a wise man hearkenunto me job hath spoken without knowledge and his words were withoutwisdom my desire is that job may be tried unto the end because of hisanswers for wicked men for he addeth rebellion unto his sin he clappeth his handsamong us and multiplieth his words against god elihu spake moreover and said  thinkest thou this to beright that thou saidst my righteousness is more than gods  for thou saidst what advantage will it be unto thee and what profitshall i have if i be cleansed from my sin   i will answer theeand thy companions with thee look unto the heavens and see and behold the clouds which arehigher than thou if thou sinnest what doest thou against him or if thytransgressions be multiplied what doest thou unto him   if thoube righteous what givest thou him or what receiveth he of thinehand   thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art and thyrighteousness may profit the son of man by reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressedto cry they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty but none saith where is god my maker who giveth songs in thenight  who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth andmaketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven   there they cry butnone giveth answer because of the pride of evil men surely god will not hear vanity neither will the almightyregard it although thou sayest thou shalt not see him yet judgment isbefore him therefore trust thou in him but now because it is not so he hath visited in his anger yethe knoweth it not in great extremity  therefore doth job openhis mouth in vain he multiplieth words without knowledge elihu also proceeded and said  suffer me a little and iwill shew thee that i have yet to speak on gods behalf i will fetch my knowledge from afar and will ascriberighteousness to my maker for truly my words shall not be false he that is perfect inknowledge is with thee behold god is mighty and despiseth not any he is mighty instrength and wisdom he preserveth not the life of the wicked but giveth right to thepoor he withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous but with kingsare they on the throne yea he doth establish them for ever and theyare exalted and if they be bound in fetters and be holden in cords ofaffliction  then he sheweth them their work and theirtransgressions that they have exceeded he openeth also their ear to discipline and commandeth thatthey return from iniquity if they obey and serve him they shall spend their days inprosperity and their years in pleasures but if they obey not they shall perish by the sword and theyshall die without knowledge but the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath they cry not when hebindeth them they die in youth and their life is among the unclean he delivereth the poor in his affliction and openeth their earsin oppression even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into abroad place where there is no straitness and that which should beset on thy table should be full of fatness but thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked judgment andjustice take hold on thee because there is wrath beware lest he take thee away with hisstroke then a great ransom cannot deliver thee will he esteem thy riches no not gold nor all the forces ofstrength desire not the night when people are cut off in their place take heed regard not iniquity for this hast thou chosen ratherthan affliction behold god exalteth by his power who teacheth like him  who hath enjoined him his way or who can say thou hast wroughtiniquity   remember that thou magnify his work which menbehold every man may see it man may behold it afar off behold god is great and we know him not neither can thenumber of his years be searched out for he maketh small the drops of water they pour down rainaccording to the vapour thereof  which the clouds do drop anddistil upon man abundantly also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds or thenoise of his tabernacle   behold he spreadeth his light uponit and covereth the bottom of the sea for by them judgeth he the people he giveth meat in abundance with clouds he covereth the light and commandeth it not toshine by the cloud that cometh betwixt the noise thereof sheweth concerning it the cattle alsoconcerning the vapour at this also my heart trembleth and is moved out of his place hear attentively the noise of his voice and the sound that goethout of his mouth he directeth it under the whole heaven and his lightning untothe ends of the earth after it a voice roareth he thundereth with the voice of hisexcellency and he will not stay them when his voice is heard god thundereth marvellously with his voice great things doethhe which we cannot comprehend for he saith to the snow be thou on the earth likewise to thesmall rain and to the great rain of his strength he sealeth up the hand of every man that all men may know hiswork then the beasts go into dens and remain in their places out of the south cometh the whirlwind and cold out of the north by the breath of god frost is given and the breadth of thewaters is straitened also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud he scattereth hisbright cloud  and it is turned round about by his counsels thatthey may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the worldin the earth he causeth it to come whether for correction or for his landor for mercy hearken unto this o job stand still and consider the wondrousworks of god dost thou know when god disposed them and caused the light ofhis cloud to shine   dost thou know the balancings of theclouds the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge how thy garments are warm when he quieteth the earth by thesouth wind   hast thou with him spread out the sky which isstrong and as a molten looking glass   teach us what we shallsay unto him for we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness shall it be told him that i speak if a man speak surely heshall be swallowed up and now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds butthe wind passeth and cleanseth them fair weather cometh out of the north with god is terriblemajesty touching the almighty we cannot find him out he is excellentin power and in judgment and in plenty of justice he will notafflict men do therefore fear him he respecteth not any that are wiseof heart then the lord answered job out of the whirlwind and said who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge  gird up now thy loins like a man for i will demand of thee andanswer thou me where wast thou when i laid the foundations of the earthdeclare if thou hast understanding who hath laid the measures thereof if thou knowest or who hathstretched the line upon it   whereupon are the foundationsthereof fastened or who laid the corner stone thereof  when themorning stars sang together and all the sons of god shouted for joy or who shut up the sea with doors when it brake forth as if ithad issued out of the womb   when i made the cloud the garmentthereof and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it  and brake upfor it my decreed place and set bars and doors  and saidhitherto shalt thou come but no further and here shall thy proudwaves be stayed   hast thou commanded the morning since thydays and caused the dayspring to know his place  that it mighttake hold of the ends of the earth that the wicked might be shakenout of it   it is turned as clay to the seal and they stand asa garment and from the wicked their light is withholden and the high armshall be broken hast thou entered into the springs of the sea or hast thouwalked in the search of the depth   have the gates of death beenopened unto thee or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth declare if thouknowest it all where is the way where light dwelleth and as for darknesswhere is the place thereof  that thou shouldest take it to thebound thereof and that thou shouldest know the paths to the housethereof   knowest thou it because thou wast then born orbecause the number of thy days is great   hast thou entered intothe treasures of the snow or hast thou seen the treasures of thehail  which i have reserved against the time of trouble againstthe day of battle and war   by what way is the light partedwhich scattereth the east wind upon the earth   who hath divideda watercourse for the overflowing of waters or a way for thelightning of thunder  to cause it to rain on the earth where noman is on the wilderness wherein there is no man  to satisfythe desolate and waste ground and to cause the bud of the tender herbto spring forth   hath the rain a father or who hath begottenthe drops of dew   out of whose womb came the ice and the hoaryfrost of

thatabundance of waters may cover thee   canst thou send lightningsthat they may go and say unto thee here we are   who hath putwisdom in the inward parts or who hath given understanding to theheart   who can number the clouds in wisdom or who can stay thebottles of heaven  when the dust groweth into hardness and theclods cleave fast together   wilt thou hunt the prey for thelion or fill the appetite of the young lions  when they couchin their dens and abide in the covert to lie in wait   whoprovideth for the raven his food when his young ones cry unto godthey wander for lack of meat

almighty instruct him he that reproveth god lethim answer it then job answered the lord and said  behold i am vilewhat shall i answer thee i will lay mine hand upon my mouth once have i spoken but i will not answer yea twice but i willproceed no further then answered the lord unto job out of the whirlwind and said gird up thy loins now like a man i will demand of thee anddeclare thou unto me wilt thou also disannul my judgment wilt thou condemn me thatthou mayest be righteous   hast thou an arm like god or canstthou thunder with a voice like him   deck thyself now withmajesty and excellency

downeven at the sight of him   none is so fierce that dare stir himup who then is able to stand before me   who hath prevented methat i should repay him whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine i will not conceal his parts nor his power nor his comelyproportion who can discover the face of his garment or who can come to himwith his double bridle   who can open the doors of his face histeeth are terrible round about his scales are his pride shut up together as with a close seal one is so near to another that no air can come between them they are joined one to another they stick together that theycannot be sundered by his neesings a light doth shine and his eyes are like theeyelids of the morning out of his mouth go burning lamps and sparks of fire leap out out of his nostrils goeth smoke as out of a seething pot orcaldron his breath kindleth coals and a flame goeth out of his mouth in his neck remaineth strength and sorrow is turned into joybefore him the flakes of his flesh are joined together they are firm inthemselves they cannot be moved his heart is as firm as a stone yea as hard as a piece of thenether millstone when he raiseth up himself the mighty are afraid by reason ofbreakings they purify themselves the sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold the spear thedart nor the habergeon he esteemeth iron as straw and brass as rotten wood the arrow cannot make him

the deep to boil like a pot he maketh the sea like apot of ointment he maketh a path to shine after him one would think the deep tobe hoary upon earth there is not his like who is made without fear he beholdeth all high things he is a king over all the childrenof pride then job answered the lord and said  i know that thou canstdo every thing and that no thought can be withholden from thee who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge therefore have iuttered that i understood not things too wonderful for me which iknew not hear i beseech thee and i will speak i will demand of theeand declare thou unto me i have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear but now mine eyeseeth thee wherefore i abhor myself and repent in dust and ashes and it was so that after the lord had spoken these words untojob the lord said to eliphaz the temanite my wrath is kindledagainst thee and against thy two friends for ye have not spoken ofme the thing that is right as my servant job hath therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams and goto my servant job and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering andmy servant job shall pray for you for him will i accept lest i dealwith you after your folly in that ye have not spoken of me the thingwhich is right like my servant job so eliphaz the temanite and bildad the shuhite and zophar thenaamathite went and did according as the lord commanded them thelord also accepted job and the lord turned the captivity of job when he prayed for hisfriends also the lord gave job twice as much as he had before then came there unto him all his brethren and all his sistersand all they that had been of his acquaintance before and did eatbread with him in his house and they bemoaned him and comforted himover all the evil that the lord had brought upon him every man alsogave him a piece of money and every one an earring of gold so the lord blessed the latter end of job more than hisbeginning for he had fourteen thousand sheep and six thousandcamels and a thousand yoke of oxen and a thousand she asses he had also seven sons and three daughters and he called the name of the first jemima and the name of thesecond kezia and the name of the third kerenhappuch and in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughtersof job and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren after this lived job an hundred and forty years and saw hissons and his sons sons even four generations so job died being old and full of daysthe book of psalms blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodlynor standeth in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of thescornful but his delight is in the law of the lord and in his law doth hemeditate day and night and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water thatbringeth forth his fruit in his season his leaf also shall notwither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper the ungodly are not so but are like the chaff which the winddriveth away therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment nor sinnersin the congregation of the righteous for the lord knoweth the way of the righteous but the way of theungodly shall perish why do the heathen rage and the people imagine a vain thing the kings of the earth set themselves and the rulers take counseltogether against the lord and against his anointed saying let us break their bands asunder and cast away their cords fromus he that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh the lord shall havethem in derision then shall he speak unto them in his wrath and vex them in hissore displeasure yet have i set my king upon my holy hill of zion i will declare the decree the lord hath said unto me thou art myson this day have i begotten thee ask of me and i shall give thee the heathen for thineinheritance and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession thou shalt break them with a rod of iron thou shalt dash them inpieces like a potters vessel be wise now therefore o ye kings be instructed ye

most high i will remember the works of the lord surely i will rememberthy wonders of old i will meditate also of all thy work and talk of thy doings thy way o god is in the sanctuary who is so great a god asour god thou art the god that doest wonders thou hast declared thystrength among the people thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people the sons of jacoband joseph selah the waters saw thee o god the waters saw thee they wereafraid the depths also were troubled the clouds poured out water the skies sent out a sound thinearrows also went abroad the voice of thy thunder was in the heaven the lightningslightened the world the earth trembled and shook thy way is in the sea and thy path in the great waters and thyfootsteps are not known thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of moses andaaron give ear o my people to my law incline your ears to the wordsof my mouth i will open my mouth in a parable i will utter dark sayings ofold which we have heard and known and our fathers have told us we will not hide them from their children shewing to thegeneration to come the praises of the lord and his strength and hiswonderful works that he hath done for he established a testimony in jacob and appointed a law inisrael which he commanded our fathers that they should make themknown to their children that the generation to come might know them even the childrenwhich should be born who should arise and declare them to theirchildren that they might set their hope in god and not forget the worksof god but keep his commandments and might not be as their fathers a stubborn and rebelliousgeneration a generation that set not their heart aright and whosespirit was not stedfast with god the children of ephraim being armed and carrying bows turnedback in the day of battle they kept not the covenant of god and refused to walk in hislaw and forgat his works and his wonders that he had shewed them marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers in theland of egypt in the field of zoan he divided the sea and caused them to pass through and he madethe waters to stand as an heap in the daytime also he led them with a cloud and all the nightwith a light of fire he clave the rocks in the wilderness and gave them drink as outof the great depths he brought streams also out of the rock and caused waters torun down like rivers and they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most highin the wilderness and they tempted god in their heart by asking meat for theirlust yea they spake against god they said can god furnish a tablein the wilderness behold he smote the rock that the waters gushed out and thestreams overflowed can he give bread also can he provide flesh forhis people therefore the lord heard this and was wroth so a fire waskindled against jacob and anger also came up against israel because they believed not in god and trusted not in hissalvation though he had commanded the clouds from above and opened thedoors of heaven and had rained down manna upon them to eat and had given themof the corn of heaven man did eat angels food he sent them meat to the full he caused an east wind to blow in the heaven and by his powerhe brought in the south wind he rained flesh also upon them as dust and feathered fowls likeas the sand of the sea and he let it fall in the midst of their camp round about theirhabitations so they did eat and were well filled for he gave them theirown desire they were not estranged from their lust but while their meatwas yet in their mouths the wrath of god came upon them and slew the fattest of themand smote down the chosen men of israel for all this they sinned still and believed not for hiswondrous works therefore their days did he consume in vanity and their yearsin trouble when he slew them then they sought him and they returned andenquired early after god and they remembered that god was their rock and the high godtheir redeemer nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth and theylied unto him with their tongues for their heart was not right with him neither were theystedfast in his covenant but he being full of compassion forgave their iniquity anddestroyed them not yea many a time turned he his anger away and didnot stir up all his wrath for he remembered that they were but flesh a wind that passethaway and cometh not again how oft did they provoke him in the wilderness and grieve himin the desert yea they turned back and tempted god and limited the holy oneof israel they remembered not his hand nor the day when he delivered themfrom the enemy how he had wrought his signs in egypt and his wonders in thefield of zoan and had turned their rivers into blood and their floods thatthey could not drink he sent divers sorts of flies among them which devoured themand frogs which destroyed them he gave also their increase unto the caterpiller and theirlabour unto the locust he destroyed their vines with hail and their sycomore treeswith frost he gave up their cattle also to the hail and their flocks tohot thunderbolts he cast upon them the fierceness of his anger wrath andindignation and trouble by sending evil angels among them he made a way to his anger he spared not their soul from deathbut gave their life over to the pestilence and smote all the firstborn in egypt the chief of theirstrength in the tabernacles of ham but made his own people to go forth like sheep and guided themin the wilderness like a flock and he led them on safely so that they feared not but the seaoverwhelmed their enemies and he brought them to the border of his sanctuary even to thismountain which his right hand had purchased he cast out the heathen also before them and divided them aninheritance by line and made the tribes of israel to dwell in theirtents yet they tempted and provoked the most high god and kept nothis testimonies but turned back and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers theywere turned aside like a deceitful bow for they provoked him to anger with their high places and movedhim to jealousy with their graven images when god heard this he was wroth and greatly abhorred israel so that he forsook the tabernacle of shiloh the tent which heplaced among men and delivered his strength into captivity and his glory intothe enemys hand he gave his people over also unto the sword and was wroth withhis inheritance the fire consumed their young men and their maidens were notgiven to marriage their priests fell by the sword and their widows made nolamentation then the lord awaked as one out of sleep and like a mighty manthat shouteth by reason of wine and he smote his enemies in the hinder parts he put them to aperpetual reproach moreover he refused the tabernacle of joseph and chose not thetribe of ephraim but chose the tribe of judah the mount zion which he loved and he built his sanctuary like high palaces like the earthwhich he hath established for ever he chose david also his servant and took him from thesheepfolds from following the ewes great with young he brought him to feedjacob his people and israel his inheritance so he fed them according to the integrity of his heart andguided them by the skilfulness of his hands o god the heathen are come into thine inheritance thy holytemple have they defiled they have laid jerusalem on heaps the dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat untothe fowls of the heaven the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts ofthe earth their blood have they shed like water round about jerusalem andthere was none to bury them we are become a reproach to our neighbours a scorn and derisionto them that are round about us how long lord wilt thou be angry for ever shall thy jealousyburn like fire pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee andupon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name for they have devoured jacob and laid waste his dwelling place o remember not against us former iniquities let thy tendermercies speedily prevent us for we are brought very low help us o god of our salvation for the glory of thy name anddeliver us and purge away our sins for thy names sake wherefore should the heathen say where is their god let him beknown among the heathen in our sight by the revenging of the blood ofthy servants which is shed let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee according tothe greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed todie and render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom theirreproach wherewith they have reproached thee o lord so we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanksfor ever we will shew forth thy praise to all generations give ear o shepherd of israel thou that leadest joseph like aflock thou that dwellest between the cherubims shine forth before ephraim and benjamin and manasseh stir up thy strengthand come and save us turn us again o god and cause thy face to shine and we shallbe saved o lord god of hosts how long wilt thou be angry against theprayer of thy people thou feedest them with the bread of tears and givest them tearsto drink in great measure thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours and our enemieslaugh among themselves turn us again o god of hosts and cause thy face to shine andwe shall be saved thou hast brought a vine out of egypt thou hast cast out theheathen and planted it thou preparedst room before it and didst cause it to take deeproot and it filled the land the hills were covered with the shadow of it and the boughsthereof were like the goodly cedars she sent out her boughs unto the sea and her branches unto theriver why hast thou then broken down her hedges so that all theywhich pass by the way do pluck her the boar out of the wood doth waste it and the wild beast ofthe field doth devour it return we beseech thee o god of hosts look down from heavenand behold and visit this vine and the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted and thebranch that thou madest strong for thyself it is burned

very few andstrangers in it when they went from one nation to another from one kingdom toanother people he suffered no man to do them wrong yea he reproved kings fortheir sakes saying touch not mine anointed and do my prophets no harm moreover he called for a famine upon the land he brake thewhole staff of bread he sent a man before them even joseph who was sold for aservant whose feet they hurt with fetters he was laid in iron until the time that his word came the word of the lord triedhim the king sent and loosed him even the ruler of the people andlet him go free he made him lord of his house and ruler of all his substance to bind his princes at his pleasure and teach his senatorswisdom israel also came into egypt and jacob sojourned in the land ofham and he increased his people

doethrighteousness at all times remember me o lord with the favour that thou bearest unto thypeople o visit me with thy salvation that i may see the good of thy chosen that i may rejoice in thegladness of thy nation that i may glory with thine inheritance we have sinned with our fathers we have committed iniquity wehave done wickedly our fathers understood not thy wonders in egypt they rememberednot the multitude of thy mercies but provoked him at the sea even atthe red sea nevertheless he saved them for his names sake that he mightmake his mighty power to be known he rebuked the red sea also and it was dried up so he led themthrough the depths as through the wilderness and he saved them from the hand of him that hated them andredeemed them from the hand of the enemy and the waters covered their enemies there was not one of themleft then believed they his words they sang his praise they soon forgat his works they waited not for his counsel but lusted exceedingly in the wilderness and tempted god inthe desert and he gave them their request but sent leanness into theirsoul they envied moses also in the camp and aaron the saint of thelord the earth opened and swallowed up dathan and covered thecompany of abiram and a fire was kindled in their company the flame burned upthe wicked they made a calf in horeb and worshipped the molten image thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox thateateth grass they forgat god their saviour which had done great things inegypt wondrous works in the land of ham and terrible things by thered sea therefore he said that he would destroy them had not moses hischosen stood before him in the breach to turn away his wrath lest heshould destroy them yea they despised the pleasant land they believed not hisword but murmured in their tents and hearkened not unto the voiceof the lord therefore he lifted up his hand against them to overthrow themin the wilderness to overthrow their seed also among the nations and to scatterthem in the lands they joined themselves also unto baalpeor and ate thesacrifices of the dead thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions and theplague brake in upon them then stood up phinehas and executed judgment and so theplague was stayed and that was counted unto him for righteousness unto allgenerations for evermore they angered him also at the waters of strife so that it wentill with moses for their sakes because they provoked his spirit so that he spake unadvisedlywith his lips they did not destroy the nations concerning whom the lordcommanded them but were mingled among the heathen and learned their works and they served their idols which were a snare unto them yea they sacrificed their sons and their daughters untodevils and shed innocent blood even the blood of their sons and oftheir daughters whom they sacrificed unto the idols of canaan andthe land was polluted with blood thus were they defiled with their own works and went a whoringwith their own inventions therefore was the wrath of the lord kindled against his peopleinsomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance and he gave them into the hand of the heathen and they thathated them ruled over them their enemies also oppressed them and they were brought intosubjection under their hand many times did he deliver them but they provoked him withtheir counsel and were brought low for their iniquity nevertheless he regarded their affliction when he heard theircry and he remembered for them his covenant and repented accordingto the multitude of his mercies he made them also to be pitied of all those that carried themcaptives save us o lord our god and gather us from among the heathento give thanks unto thy holy name and to triumph in thy praise blessed be the lord god of israel from

havei hated instruction and my heart despised reproof  and have notobeyed the voice of my teachers nor inclined mine ear to them thatinstructed me   i was almost in all evil in the midst of thecongregation and assembly drink waters out of thine own cistern and running waters out ofthine own well let thy fountains be dispersed abroad and rivers of waters inthe streets let them be only thine own and not strangers with thee let thy fountain be blessed and rejoice with the wife of thyyouth let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe let her breastssatisfy thee at all times and be thou ravished always with her love and why wilt thou my son be ravished with a strange woman andembrace the bosom of a stranger   for the ways of man are beforethe eyes of the lord and he pondereth all his goings his own iniquities shall take the wicked himself and he shall beholden with the cords of his sins he shall die without instruction and in the greatness of hisfolly he shall go astray my son if thou be surety for thy friend if thou hast strickenthy hand with a stranger  thou art snared with the words of thymouth thou art taken with the words of thy mouth do this now my son and deliver

hunter and as abird from the hand of the fowler go to the ant thou sluggard consider her ways and be wise which having no guide overseer or ruler  provideth her meat inthe summer and gathereth her food in the harvest how long wilt thou sleep o sluggard when wilt thou arise out ofthy sleep   yet a little sleep a little slumber a littlefolding of the hands to sleep  so shall thy poverty come as onethat travelleth and thy want as an armed man a naughty person a wicked man walketh with a froward mouth he winketh with his eyes he speaketh with his feet he teachethwith his fingers  frowardness

anabomination unto him  a proud look a lying tongue and handsthat shed innocent blood  an heart that deviseth wickedimaginations feet that be swift in running to mischief  a falsewitness that speaketh lies and he that soweth discord among brethren my son keep thy fathers commandment and forsake not the law ofthy mother  bind them continually upon thine heart and tie themabout thy neck when thou goest it shall lead thee when thou sleepest it shallkeep thee and when thou awakest it shall talk with thee for the commandment is a lamp and the law is light and reproofsof instruction are the way of life  to keep thee from the evilwoman from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman lust not after her beauty in thine heart neither let her takethee with her eyelids for by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece ofbread and the adultress will hunt for the precious life can a man take fire in his bosom and his clothes not be burned can one go upon hot coals and his feet not be burned   sohe that goeth in to his neighbours wife whosoever toucheth her shallnot be innocent men do not despise a thief if he steal to satisfy his soul whenhe is hungry  but if he be found he shall restore sevenfold heshall give all the substance of his house but whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understandinghe that doeth it destroyeth his own soul a wound and dishonour shall he

givest many gifts my son keep my words and lay up my commandments with thee keep my commandments and live and my law as the apple of thineeye bind them upon thy fingers write them upon the table of thineheart say unto wisdom thou art my sister and call understanding thykinswoman  that they may keep thee from the strange woman fromthe stranger which flattereth with her words for at the window of my house i looked through my casement and beheld among the simple ones i discerned among the youths ayoung man void of understanding  passing through the street nearher corner and he went the way to her house  in the twilight inthe evening in the black and dark night  and behold there methim a woman with the attire of an harlot and subtil of heart she is loud and stubborn her feet abide not in her house now is she without now in the streets and lieth in wait at everycorner   so she caught him and kissed him and with an impudentface said unto him  i have peace offerings with me this day havei payed my vows therefore came i forth to meet thee diligently to seek thy faceand i have found thee i have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry with carvedworks with fine linen of egypt i have perfumed my bed with myrrh aloes and cinnamon come let us take our fill of love until the morning let ussolace ourselves with loves for the goodman is not at home he is gone a long journey he hath taken a bag of money with him and will come home at the dayappointed with her much fair speech she caused him to yield with theflattering of her lips she forced him he goeth after her straightway as an ox goeth to the slaughteror as a fool to the correction of the stocks  till a dart strikethrough his liver as a bird hasteth to the snare and knoweth notthat it is for his life hearken unto me now therefore o ye children and attend to thewords of my mouth let not thine heart decline to her ways go not astray in herpaths for she hath cast down many wounded yea many strong men havebeen slain by her her house is the way to hell going down to the chambers ofdeath doth not wisdom cry and understanding put forth her voice  she standeth in the top of high places by the way in the places ofthe paths she crieth at the gates at the entry of the city at the comingin at the doors unto you o men i call and my voice is to the sons of man o ye simple understand wisdom and ye fools be ye of anunderstanding heart hear for i will speak of excellent things and the opening of mylips shall be right things for my mouth shall speak truth and wickedness is an abominationto my lips all the words of my mouth are in righteousness there is nothingfroward or perverse in them they are all plain to him that understandeth and right to themthat find knowledge receive my instruction and not silver and knowledge rather thanchoice gold for wisdom is better than rubies and all the things that may bedesired are not to be compared to it i wisdom dwell with prudence and find out knowledge of wittyinventions the fear of the lord is to hate evil pride and arrogancy andthe evil way and the froward mouth do i hate counsel is mine and sound wisdom i am understanding i havestrength by me kings reign and princes decree justice by me princes rule and nobles even all the judges of the earth i love them that love me and those that seek me early shall findme riches and honour are with me yea durable riches andrighteousness my fruit is better than gold yea than fine gold and my revenuethan choice silver i lead in the way of righteousness in the midst of the paths ofjudgment  that i may cause those that love me to inheritsubstance and i will fill their treasures the lord possessed me in the beginning of his way before hisworks of old i was set up from everlasting from the beginning or ever theearth was when there were no depths i was brought forth when there wereno fountains abounding with water before the mountains were settled before the hills was i broughtforth  while as yet he had not made the earth nor the fieldsnor the highest part of the dust of the world when he prepared the heavens i was there when he set a compassupon the face of the depth  when he established the clouds abovewhen he strengthened the fountains of the deep  when he gave tothe sea his decree that the waters should not pass his commandmentwhen he appointed the foundations of the earth  then i was byhim as one brought up with him and i was daily his delightrejoicing always before him  rejoicing in the habitable part ofhis earth and my delights were with the sons of men now therefore hearken unto me o ye children for blessed arethey that keep my ways hear instruction and be wise and refuse it not blessed is the man that heareth me watching daily at my gateswaiting at the posts of my doors for whoso findeth me findeth life and shall obtain favour of thelord but he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul all theythat hate me love death wisdom hath builded her house she hath hewn out her sevenpillars  she hath killed her beasts she hath mingled her wineshe hath also furnished her table she hath sent forth her maidens she crieth upon the highestplaces of the city  whoso is simple let him turn in hither asfor him that wanteth understanding she saith to him  come eat ofmy bread and drink of the wine which i have mingled forsake the foolish and live and go in the way of understanding he that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame and he thatrebuketh a wicked man getteth himself a blot reprove not a scorner lest he hate thee rebuke a wise man andhe will love thee give instruction to a wise man and he will be yet wiser teach ajust man and he will increase in learning the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom and theknowledge of the holy is understanding for by me thy days shall be multiplied and the years of thy lifeshall be increased if thou be wise thou shalt be wise for thyself but if thouscornest thou alone shalt bear it a foolish woman is clamorous she is simple and knoweth nothing for she sitteth at the door of her house on a seat in the highplaces of the city  to call passengers who go right on theirways  whoso is simple let him turn in hither and as for himthat wanteth understanding she saith to him  stolen waters aresweet and bread eaten in secret is pleasant but he knoweth not that the dead are there and that her guestsare in the depths of hell the proverbs of solomon a wise son maketh a glad father but afoolish son is the heaviness of his mother treasures of wickedness profit nothing but

mouth of the wicked hatred stirreth up strifes but love covereth all sins in the lips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found buta rod is for the back of him that is void of understanding wise men lay up knowledge but the mouth of the foolish is neardestruction the rich mans wealth is his strong city the destruction of thepoor is their poverty the labour of the righteous tendeth to life the fruit of thewicked to sin he is in the way of life that keepeth instruction but he thatrefuseth reproof erreth he that hideth hatred with lying lips and he that uttereth aslander is a fool in the multitude of words there wanteth not sin but he thatrefraineth his lips is wise the tongue of the just is as choice silver the heart of thewicked is little worth the lips of the righteous feed many but fools die for want ofwisdom the blessing of the lord it maketh rich and he addeth nosorrow with it it is as sport to a fool to do mischief but a man ofunderstanding hath wisdom the fear of the wicked it shall come upon him but the desireof the righteous shall be granted as the whirlwind passeth so is the wicked no more but therighteous is an everlasting foundation as vinegar to the teeth and as smoke to the eyes so is thesluggard to them that send him the fear of the lord prolongeth days but the years of thewicked shall be shortened the hope of the righteous shall be gladness but the

delivered when it goeth well with the righteous the city rejoiceth andwhen the wicked perish there is shouting by the blessing of the upright the city is exalted but it isoverthrown by the mouth of the wicked he that is void of wisdom despiseth his neighbour but a man ofunderstanding holdeth his peace a talebearer revealeth secrets but he that is of a faithfulspirit concealeth the matter where no counsel is the people fall but in the multitude ofcounsellors there is safety he that is surety for a stranger shall smart for it and he thathateth suretiship is sure a gracious woman retaineth honour and strong men retain riches the merciful man doeth good to his own soul but he that iscruel troubleth his own flesh the wicked worketh a deceitful work but to him that sowethrighteousness

hell and destruction are before the lord how much more then thehearts of the children of men   a scorner loveth not one thatreproveth him neither will he go unto the wise a merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance but by sorrow ofthe heart the spirit is broken the heart of him that hath understanding seeketh knowledge butthe mouth of fools feedeth on foolishness all the days of the afflicted are evil but he that is of amerry heart hath a continual feast better is little with the fear of the lord than great treasureand trouble therewith better is a dinner of herbs where love is than a stalled ox andhatred therewith a wrathful man stirreth up strife but he that is slow to angerappeaseth strife the way of the slothful man is as an hedge of thorns but theway of the righteous is made plain a wise son maketh a glad father but a foolish man despiseth hismother folly is joy to him that is destitute of wisdom but a man ofunderstanding walketh uprightly without counsel purposes are disappointed but in the multitudeof counsellors they are established a man hath joy by the answer of his mouth and a word spoken indue season how good is it   the way of life is above to thewise that he may depart from hell beneath the lord will destroy the house of the proud but he willestablish the border of the widow the thoughts of the wicked are an abomination to the lord butthe words of the pure are pleasant words he that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house but he thathateth gifts shall live the heart of the righteous studieth to answer but the mouth ofthe wicked poureth out evil things the lord is far from the wicked but he heareth the prayer ofthe righteous the light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart and a good reportmaketh the bones fat the ear that heareth the reproof of life abideth among the wise he that refuseth instruction despiseth his own soul but he thatheareth reproof getteth understanding the fear of the lord is the instruction of wisdom and beforehonour is humility the preparations of the heart in man and the answer of thetongue is from the lord all the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes but the lordweigheth the spirits commit thy works unto the lord and thy thoughts shall beestablished the lord hath made all things for himself yea even the wickedfor the day of evil every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to the lordthough hand join in hand he shall not be unpunished by mercy and truth iniquity is purged and by the fear of thelord men depart from evil when a mans ways please the lord he maketh even his enemies tobe at peace with him better is a little with righteousness than great revenues withoutright a mans heart deviseth his way but the lord directeth his steps a divine sentence is in the lips of the king his mouthtransgresseth not in judgment a just weight and balance are the lords all the weights of thebag are his work it is an abomination to kings to commit wickedness for thethrone is established by righteousness righteous lips are the delight of kings and they love him thatspeaketh right the wrath of a king is as messengers of death but a wise manwill pacify it in the light of the kings countenance is life and his favouris as a cloud of the latter rain how much better is it to get wisdom than gold and to getunderstanding rather to be chosen than silver   the highway ofthe upright is to depart from evil he that keepeth his way preservethhis soul pride goeth before destruction and an haughty spirit before afall better it is to be of an humble spirit with the lowly than todivide the spoil with the proud he that handleth a matter wisely shall find good and whosotrusteth in the lord happy is he the wise in heart shall be called prudent and the sweetness ofthe lips increaseth learning understanding is a wellspring of life unto him that hath it butthe instruction of fools is folly the heart of the wise teacheth his mouth and addeth learning tohis lips pleasant words are as an honeycomb sweet to the soul andhealth to the bones there is a way that seemeth right unto a man but the endthereof are the ways of death he that laboureth laboureth for himself for his mouth cravethit of him an ungodly man diggeth up evil and in his lips there is as aburning fire a froward man soweth strife and a whisperer separateth chieffriends a violent man enticeth his neighbour and leadeth him into theway that is not good he shutteth his eyes to devise froward things moving his lipshe bringeth evil to pass the hoary head is a crown of glory if it be found in the way ofrighteousness he that is slow to anger is better than the mighty and he thatruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city the lot is cast into the lap but the whole disposing thereof isof the lord better is a dry morsel and quietness therewith than an housefull of sacrifices with strife a wise servant shall have rule over a son that causeth shame andshall have part of the inheritance among the brethren the fining pot is for silver and the furnace for gold but thelord trieth the hearts a wicked doer giveth heed to false lips and a liar giveth ear toa naughty tongue whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his maker and he that is gladat calamities shall not be unpunished childrens children are the crown of old men and the glory ofchildren are their fathers excellent speech becometh not a fool much less do lying lips aprince a gift is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath itwhithersoever it turneth it prospereth he that covereth a transgression seeketh love but he thatrepeateth a matter separateth very friends a reproof entereth more into a wise man than an hundred stripesinto a fool an evil man seeketh only rebellion therefore a cruel messengershall be sent against him let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man rather than a foolin his folly whoso rewardeth evil for good evil shall not depart from hishouse the beginning of strife is as when one letteth out watertherefore leave off contention before it be meddled with he that justifieth the wicked and he that condemneth the justeven they both are abomination to the lord wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdomseeing he hath no heart to it   a friend loveth at all timesand a brother is born for adversity a man void of understanding striketh hands and becometh suretyin the presence of his friend he loveth transgression that loveth strife and he that exaltethhis gate seeketh destruction he that hath a froward heart findeth no good and he that hath aperverse tongue falleth into mischief he that begetteth a fool doeth it to his sorrow and the fatherof a fool hath no joy a merry heart doeth good like a medicine but a broken spiritdrieth the bones a wicked man taketh a gift out of the bosom to pervert the waysof judgment wisdom is before him that hath understanding but the eyes of afool are in the ends of the earth a foolish son is a grief to his father and bitterness to herthat bare him also to punish the just is not good nor to strike princes forequity he that hath knowledge spareth his words and a man ofunderstanding is of an excellent spirit even a fool when he holdeth his peace is counted wise and hethat shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding through desire a man having separated himself seeketh andintermeddleth with all wisdom a fool hath no delight in understanding but that his heart maydiscover itself when the wicked cometh then cometh also contempt and withignominy reproach the words of a mans mouth are as deep waters and the wellspringof wisdom as a flowing brook it is not good to accept the person of the wicked to overthrowthe righteous in judgment a fools lips enter into contention and his mouth calleth forstrokes a fools mouth is his destruction and his lips are the snare ofhis soul the words of a talebearer are as wounds and they go down intothe innermost parts of the belly he also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is agreat waster the name of the lord is a strong tower the righteous runnethinto it and is safe the rich mans wealth is his strong city and as an high wall inhis own conceit before destruction the heart of man is haughty and beforehonour is humility he that answereth a matter before he heareth it it is folly andshame unto him the spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity but a woundedspirit who can bear   the heart of the prudent gettethknowledge and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge a mans gift maketh room for him and bringeth him before greatmen he that is first in his own cause seemeth just but hisneighbour cometh and searcheth him the lot causeth contentions to cease and parteth between themighty a brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city andtheir contentions are like the bars of a castle a mans belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouthand with the increase of his lips shall he be filled death and life are in the power of the tongue and they thatlove it shall eat the fruit thereof whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing and obtaineth favourof the lord the poor useth intreaties but the rich answereth roughly a man that hath friends must shew himself friendly and there isa friend that sticketh closer than a brother better is the poor that walketh in his integrity than he that isperverse in his lips and is a fool also that the soul be without knowledge it is not good and hethat hasteth with his feet sinneth the foolishness of man perverteth his way and his heart frettethagainst the lord wealth maketh many friends but the poor is separated from hisneighbour a false witness shall not be unpunished and he that speakethlies shall not escape many will intreat the favour of the prince and every man is afriend to him that giveth gifts all the brethren of the poor do hate him how much more do hisfriends go far from him he pursueth them with words yet they arewanting to him he that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul he that keepethunderstanding shall find good a false witness shall not be unpunished and he that speakethlies shall perish delight is not seemly for a fool much less for a servant tohave rule over princes the discretion of a man deferreth his anger and it is his gloryto pass over a transgression the kings wrath is as the roaring of a lion but his favour isas dew upon the grass a foolish son is the calamity of his father and the contentionsof a wife are a continual dropping house and riches are the inheritance of fathers and a prudentwife is from the lord slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep and an idle soul shallsuffer hunger he that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul but hethat despiseth his ways shall die he that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the lord and thatwhich he hath given will he pay him again chasten thy son while there is hope and let not thy soul sparefor his crying a man of great wrath shall suffer punishment for if thoudeliver him yet thou must do it again hear counsel and receive instruction that thou mayest be wisein thy latter end there are many devices in a mans heart nevertheless thecounsel of the lord that shall stand the desire of a man is his kindness and a poor man is betterthan a liar the fear of the lord tendeth to life and he that hath it shallabide satisfied he shall not be visited with evil a slothful man hideth his hand in his bosom and will not somuch as bring it to his mouth again smite a scorner and the simple will beware and reprove onethat hath understanding and he will understand knowledge he that wasteth his father and chaseth away his mother is ason that causeth shame and bringeth reproach cease my son to hear the instruction that causeth to err fromthe words of knowledge an ungodly witness scorneth judgment and the mouth of thewicked devoureth iniquity judgments are prepared for scorners and stripes for the back offools wine is a mocker strong drink is raging and whosoever isdeceived thereby is not wise the fear of a king is as the roaring of a lion whoso provokethhim to anger sinneth against his own soul it is an honour for a man to cease from strife but every foolwill be meddling the sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold therefore shallhe beg in harvest and have nothing counsel in the heart of man is like deep water but a man ofunderstanding will draw it out most men will proclaim every one his own goodness but a faithfulman who can find   the just man walketh in his integrity hischildren are blessed after him a king that sitteth in the throne of judgment scattereth away allevil with his eyes who can say i have made my heart clean i am pure from my sin divers weights and divers measures both of them are alikeabomination to the lord even a child is known by his doings whether his work be pureand whether it be right the hearing ear and the seeing eye the lord hath made evenboth of them love not sleep lest thou come to poverty open thine eyes andthou shalt be satisfied with bread it is naught it is naught saith the buyer but when he is gonehis way then he boasteth there is gold and a multitude of rubies but the lips ofknowledge are a precious jewel take his garment that is surety for a stranger and take apledge of him for a strange woman bread of deceit is sweet to a man but afterwards his mouthshall be filled with gravel every purpose is established by counsel and with good advicemake war he that goeth about as a talebearer revealeth secrets thereforemeddle not with him that flattereth with his lips whoso curseth his father or his mother his lamp shall be putout in obscure darkness an inheritance may be gotten hastily at the beginning but theend thereof shall not be blessed say not thou i will recompense evil but wait on the lord andhe shall save thee divers weights are an abomination unto the lord and a falsebalance is not good mans goings are of the lord how can a man then understand hisown way   it is a snare to the man who devoureth that which isholy and after vows to make enquiry a wise king scattereth the wicked and bringeth the wheel overthem the spirit of man is the candle of the lord searching all theinward parts of the belly mercy and truth preserve the king and his throne is upholden bymercy the glory of young men is their strength and the beauty of oldmen is the grey head the blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil so do stripes theinward parts of the belly the kings heart is in the hand of the lord as the rivers ofwater he turneth it whithersoever he will every way of a man is right in his own eyes but the lordpondereth the hearts to do justice and judgment is more acceptable to the lord thansacrifice an high look and a proud heart and the plowing of the wickedis sin the thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness but ofevery one that is hasty only to want the getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed toand fro of them that seek death the robbery of the wicked shall destroy them because they refuseto do judgment the way of man is froward and strange but as for the pure hiswork is right it is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop than with abrawling woman in a wide house the soul of the wicked desireth evil his neighbour findeth nofavour in his eyes when the scorner is punished the simple is made wise and whenthe wise is instructed he receiveth knowledge the righteous man wisely considereth the house of the wickedbut god overthroweth the wicked for their wickedness whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor he also shallcry himself but shall not be heard a gift in secret pacifieth anger and a reward in the bosomstrong wrath it is joy to the just to do judgment but destruction shall beto the workers of iniquity the man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shallremain in the congregation of the dead he that loveth pleasure shall be a poor man he that loveth wineand oil shall not be rich the wicked shall be a ransom for the righteous and thetransgressor for the upright it is better to dwell in the wilderness than with a contentiousand an angry woman there is treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of thewise but a foolish man spendeth it up he that followeth after righteousness and mercy findeth liferighteousness and honour a wise man scaleth the city of the mighty and casteth down thestrength of the confidence thereof whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul fromtroubles proud and haughty scorner is his name who dealeth in proudwrath the desire of the slothful killeth him for his hands refuse tolabour he coveteth greedily all the day long but the righteous givethand spareth not the sacrifice of the wicked is abomination how much more whenhe bringeth it with a wicked mind   a false witness shallperish but the man that heareth speaketh constantly a wicked man hardeneth his face but as for the upright hedirecteth his way there is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against thelord the horse is prepared against the day of battle but safety isof the lord a good name is rather to be chosen than great riches and lovingfavour rather than silver and gold the rich and poor meet together the lord is the maker of themall a prudent man foreseeth the evil and hideth himself but thesimple pass on and are punished by humility and the fear of the lord are riches and honour andlife thorns and snares are in the way of the froward he that dothkeep his soul shall be far from them train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old hewill not depart from it the rich ruleth over the poor and the borrower is servant to thelender he that soweth iniquity shall reap vanity and the rod of hisanger shall fail he that hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed for he giveth ofhis bread to the poor cast out the scorner and contention shall go out yea strifeand reproach shall cease he that loveth pureness of heart for the grace of his lips theking shall be his friend the eyes of the lord preserve knowledge and he overthroweth thewords of the transgressor the slothful man saith there is a lion without i shall beslain in the streets the mouth of strange women is a deep pit he that is abhorred ofthe lord shall fall therein foolishness is bound in the heart of a child but the rod ofcorrection shall drive it far from him he that oppresseth the poor to increase his riches and he thatgiveth to the rich shall surely come to want bow down thine ear and hear the words of the wise and applythine heart unto my knowledge for it is a pleasant thing if thou

them every man shall kiss his lips that giveth a right answer prepare thy work without and make it fit for thyself in thefield and afterwards build thine house be not a witness against thy neighbour without cause anddeceive not with thy lips say not i will do so to him as he hath done to me i willrender to the man according to his work i went by the field of the slothful and by the vineyard of theman void of understanding  and lo it was all grown over withthorns and nettles had covered the face thereof and the stone wallthereof was broken down then i saw and considered it well i looked upon it andreceived instruction yet a little sleep a little slumber a little folding of thehands to sleep  so shall thy poverty come as one thattravelleth and thy want as an armed man these are also proverbs of solomon which the men of hezekiahking of judah copied out it is the glory of god to conceal a thing but the honour ofkings is to search out a matter the heaven for height and the earth for depth and the heart ofkings is unsearchable take away the dross from the silver and there shall come forth avessel for the finer take away the wicked from before the king and his throne shallbe established in righteousness put not forth thyself in the presence of the king and stand notin the place of great men  for better it is that it be said untothee come up hither than that thou shouldest be put lower in thepresence of the prince whom thine eyes have seen go not forth hastily to strive lest thou know not what to do inthe end thereof when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame debate thy cause with thy neighbour himself and discover not asecret to another  lest he that heareth it put thee to shameand thine infamy turn not away a word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures ofsilver as an earring of gold and an ornament of fine gold so is awise reprover upon an obedient ear as the cold of snow in the time of harvest so is a faithfulmessenger to them that send him for he refresheth the soul of hismasters whoso boasteth himself of a false gift is like clouds and windwithout rain by long forbearing is a prince persuaded and a soft tonguebreaketh the bone hast thou found honey eat so much as is sufficient for theelest thou be filled therewith and vomit it withdraw thy foot from thy neighbours house lest he be wearyof thee and so hate thee a man that beareth false witness against his neighbour is amaul and a sword and a sharp arrow confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble is like abroken tooth and a foot out of joint as he that taketh away a garment in cold weather and as vinegarupon nitre so is he that singeth songs to an heavy heart if thine enemy be hungry give him bread to eat and if he bethirsty give him water to drink  for thou shalt heap coals offire upon his head and the lord shall reward thee the north wind driveth away rain so doth an angry countenance abackbiting tongue it is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop than with abrawling woman and in a wide house as cold waters to a thirsty soul so is good news from a farcountry a righteous man falling down before the wicked is as a troubledfountain and a corrupt spring it is not good to eat much honey so for men to search their ownglory is not glory he that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that isbroken down and without walls as snow in summer and as rain in harvest so honour is notseemly for a fool as the bird by wandering as the swallow by flying so the cursecauseless shall not come a whip for the horse a bridle for the ass and a rod for thefools back answer not a fool according to his folly lest thou also be likeunto him answer a fool according to his folly lest he be wise in his ownconceit he that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool cutteth off thefeet and drinketh damage the legs of the lame are not equal so is a parable in the mouthof fools as he that bindeth a stone in a sling so is he that givethhonour to a fool as a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard so is a parablein the mouths of fools the great god that formed all things both rewardeth the fooland rewardeth transgressors as a dog returneth to his vomit so a fool returneth to hisfolly seest thou a man wise in his own conceit there is more hope ofa fool than of him the slothful man saith there is a lion in the way a lion is inthe streets as the door turneth upon his hinges so doth the slothful uponhis bed the slothful hideth his hand in his bosom it grieveth him tobring it again to his mouth the sluggard is wiser in his own conceit than seven men that canrender a reason he that passeth by and meddleth with strife belonging not tohim is like one that taketh a dog by the ears as a mad man who casteth firebrands arrows and death  sois the man that deceiveth his neighbour and saith am not i in sport where no wood is there the fire goeth out so where there is notalebearer the strife ceaseth as coals are to burning coals and wood to fire so is acontentious man to kindle strife the words of a talebearer are as wounds and they go down intothe innermost parts of the belly burning lips and a wicked heart are like a potsherd covered withsilver dross he that hateth dissembleth with his lips and layeth up deceitwithin him  when he speaketh fair believe him not for thereare seven abominations in his heart whose hatred is covered by deceit his wickedness shall beshewed before the whole congregation whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein and he that rolleth astone it will return upon him a lying tongue hateth those that are afflicted by it and aflattering mouth worketh ruin boast not thyself of to morrow for thou knowest not what a daymay bring forth let another man praise thee and not thine own mouth a strangerand not thine own lips a stone is heavy and the sand weighty but a fools wrath isheavier than them both wrath is cruel and anger is outrageous but who is able to standbefore envy   open rebuke is better than secret love faithful are the wounds of a friend but the kisses of an enemyare deceitful the full soul loatheth an honeycomb but to the hungry soul everybitter thing is sweet as a bird that wandereth from her nest so is a man thatwandereth from his place ointment and perfume rejoice the heart so doth the sweetness ofa mans friend by hearty counsel thine own friend and thy fathers friend forsake not neithergo into thy brothers house in the day of thy calamity for better isa neighbour that is near than a brother far off my son be wise and make my heart glad that i may answer himthat reproacheth me a prudent man foreseeth the evil and hideth himself but thesimple pass on and are punished take his garment that is surety for a stranger and take apledge of him for a strange woman he that blesseth his friend with a loud voice rising early inthe morning it shall be counted a curse to him a continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious womanare alike whosoever hideth her hideth the wind and the ointment of hisright hand which bewrayeth itself iron sharpeneth iron so a man sharpeneth the countenance of hisfriend whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof so hethat waiteth on his master shall be honoured as in water face answereth to face so the heart of man to man hell and destruction are never full so the eyes of man arenever satisfied as the fining pot for silver and the furnace for gold so is aman to his praise though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with apestle yet will not his foolishness depart from him be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks and look wellto thy herds for riches are not for ever and doth the crown endure to everygeneration   the hay appeareth and the tender grass shewethitself and herbs of the mountains are gathered the lambs are for thy clothing and the goats are the price ofthe field and thou shalt have goats milk enough for thy food for thefood of thy household and for the maintenance for thy maidens the wicked flee when no man pursueth but the righteous are boldas a lion for the transgression of a land many are the princes thereof butby a man of understanding and knowledge the state thereof shall beprolonged a poor man that oppresseth the poor is like a sweeping rain whichleaveth no food they that forsake the law praise the wicked but such as keep thelaw contend with them evil men understand not judgment but they that seek the lordunderstand all things better is the poor that walketh in his uprightness than he thatis perverse in his ways though he be rich whoso keepeth the law is a wise son but he that is a companionof riotous men shameth his father he that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance heshall gather it for him that will pity the poor he that turneth away his ear from hearing the law even hisprayer shall be abomination whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way heshall fall himself into his own pit but the upright shall have goodthings in possession the rich man is wise in his own conceit but the poor that hathunderstanding searcheth him out when righteous men do rejoice there is great glory but whenthe wicked rise a man is hidden he that covereth his sins shall not prosper but whosoconfesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy happy is the man that feareth alway but he that hardeneth hisheart shall fall into mischief as a roaring lion and a ranging bear so is a wicked ruler overthe poor people the prince that wanteth understanding is also a great oppressorbut he that hateth covetousness shall prolong his days a man that doeth violence to the blood of any person shall fleeto the pit let no man stay him whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved but he that is perversein his ways shall fall at once he that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread but he thatfolloweth after vain persons shall have poverty enough a faithful man shall abound with blessings but he that makethhaste to be rich shall not be innocent to have respect of persons is not good for for a piece of breadthat man will transgress he that hasteth to be rich hath an evil eye and considereth notthat poverty shall come upon him he that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favour than hethat flattereth with the tongue whoso robbeth his father or his mother and saith it is notransgression the same is the companion of a destroyer he that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife but he thatputteth his trust in the lord shall be made fat he that trusteth in his own heart is a fool but whoso walkethwisely he shall be delivered he that giveth unto the poor shall not lack but he that hidethhis eyes shall have many a curse when the wicked rise men hide themselves but when they perishthe righteous increase he that being often reproved hardeneth his neck shall suddenlybe destroyed and that without remedy when the righteous are in authority the people rejoice but whenthe wicked beareth rule the people mourn whoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father but he that keepethcompany with harlots spendeth his substance the king by judgment establisheth the land but he that receivethgifts overthroweth it a man that flattereth his neighbour spreadeth a net for his feet in the transgression of an evil man there is a snare but therighteous doth sing and rejoice the righteous considereth the cause of the poor but the wickedregardeth not to know it scornful men bring a city into a snare but wise men turn awaywrath if a wise man contendeth with a foolish man whether he rage orlaugh there is no rest the bloodthirsty

isvanity what profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under thesun   one generation passeth away and another generation comethbut the earth abideth for ever the sun also ariseth and the sun goeth down and hasteth to hisplace where he arose the wind goeth toward the south and turneth about unto the northit whirleth about continually and the wind returneth again accordingto his circuits all the rivers run into the sea yet the sea is not full unto theplace from whence the rivers come thither they return again all things are full of labour man cannot utter it the eye is notsatisfied with seeing nor the ear filled with hearing the thing that hath been it is that which shall be and thatwhich is done is that which shall be done and there is no new thingunder the sun is there any thing whereof it may be said see this is new ithath been already of old time which was before us there is no remembrance of former things neither shall there beany remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall comeafter i the preacher was king over israel in jerusalem and i gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerningall things that are done under heaven this sore travail hath godgiven to the sons of man to be exercised therewith i have seen all the works that are done under the sun andbehold all is vanity and vexation of spirit that which is crooked cannot be made straight and that which iswanting cannot be numbered i communed with mine own heart saying lo i am come to greatestate and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have beenbefore me in jerusalem yea my heart had great experience of wisdomand knowledge and i gave my heart to know wisdom and to know madness andfolly i perceived that this also is vexation of spirit for in much wisdom is much grief and he that increasethknowledge increaseth sorrow i said in mine heart go to now i will prove thee with mirththerefore enjoy pleasure and behold this also is vanity i said of laughter it is mad and of mirth what doeth it   isought in mine heart to give myself unto wine yet acquainting mineheart with wisdom and to lay hold on folly till i might see what wasthat good for the sons of men which they should do under the heavenall the days of their life i made me great works i builded me houses i planted mevineyards  i made me gardens and orchards and i planted trees inthem of all kind of fruits  i made me pools of water to watertherewith the wood that bringeth forth trees  i got me servantsand maidens and had servants born in my house also i had greatpossessions of great and small cattle above all that were in jerusalembefore me  i gathered me also silver and gold and the peculiartreasure of kings and of the provinces i gat me men singers and womensingers and the delights of the sons of men as musical instrumentsand that of all sorts so i was great and increased more than all that were before me injerusalem also my wisdom remained with me and whatsoever mine eyes desired i kept not from them i withheldnot my heart from any joy for my heart rejoiced in all my labour andthis was my portion of all my labour then i looked on all the works that my hands had wrought and onthe labour that i had laboured to do and behold all was vanity andvexation of spirit and there was no profit under the sun and i turned myself to behold wisdom and madness and folly forwhat can the man do that cometh after the king even that which hathbeen already done then i saw that wisdom excelleth folly as far as light excellethdarkness the wise mans eyes are in his head but the fool walketh indarkness and i myself perceived also that one event happeneth to themall then said i in my heart as it happeneth to the fool so ithappeneth even to me and why was i then more wise then i said in myheart that this also is vanity for there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool forever seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all beforgottenand how dieth the wise man as the fool therefore i hated life because the work that is wrought underthe sun is grievous unto me for all is vanity and vexation of spirit yea i hated all my labour which i had taken under the sunbecause i should leave it unto the man that shall be after me and who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool yetshall he have rule over all my labour wherein i have laboured andwherein i have shewed myself wise under the sun this is also vanity therefore i went about to cause my heart to despair of all thelabour which i took under the sun for there is a man whose labour is in wisdom and in knowledgeand in equity yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall heleave it for his portion this also is vanity and a great evil for what hath man of all his labour and of the vexation of hisheart wherein he hath laboured under the sun   for all his daysare sorrows and his travail grief yea his heart taketh not rest inthe night this is also vanity there is nothing better for a man than that he should eat anddrink and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour thisalso i saw that it was from the hand of god for who can eat or who else can hasten hereunto more than i for god giveth to a man that is good in his sight wisdom andknowledge and joy but to the sinner he giveth travail to gather andto heap up that he may give to him that is good before god this alsois vanity and vexation of spirit to every thing there is a season and a time to every purposeunder the heaven  a time to be born and a time to die a time toplant and a time to pluck up that which is planted  a time tokill and a time to heal a time to break down and a time to buildup  a time to weep and a time to laugh a time to mourn and atime to dance  a time to cast away stones and a time to gatherstones together a time to embrace and a time to refrain fromembracing  a time to get and a time to lose a time to keep anda time to cast away  a time to rend and a time to sew a time tokeep silence and a time to speak  a time to love and a time tohate a time of war and a time of peace what profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth i have seen the travail which god hath given to the sons of mento be exercised in it he hath made every thing beautiful in his time also he hath setthe world in their heart so that no man can find out the work thatgod maketh from the beginning to the end i know that there is no good in them but for a man to rejoiceand to do good in his life and also that every man should eat and drink and enjoy the goodof all his labour it is the gift of god i know that whatsoever god doeth it shall be for ever nothingcan be put to it nor any thing taken from it and god doeth it thatmen should fear before him that which hath been is now and that which is to be hath alreadybeen and god requireth that which is past and moreover i saw under the sun the place of judgment thatwickedness was there and the place of righteousness that iniquitywas there i said in mine heart god shall judge the righteous and thewicked for there is a time there for every purpose and for everywork i said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of menthat god might manifest them and that they might see that theythemselves are beasts for that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts evenone thing befalleth them as the one dieth so dieth the other yeathey have all one breath so that a man hath no preeminence above abeast for all is vanity all go unto one place all are of the dust and all turn to dustagain who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward and the spiritof the beast that goeth downward to the earth   wherefore iperceive that there is nothing better than that a man should rejoicein his own works for that is his portion for who shall bring him tosee what shall be after him   so i returned and considered allthe oppressions that are done under the sun and behold the tears ofsuch as were oppressed and they had no comforter and on the side oftheir oppressors there was power but they had no comforter wherefore i praised the dead which are already dead more than theliving which are yet alive yea better is he than both they which hath not yet been whohath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun again i considered all travail and every right work that forthis a man is envied of his neighbour this is also vanity andvexation of spirit the fool foldeth his hands together and eateth his own flesh better is an handful with quietness than both the hands full withtravail and vexation of spirit then i returned and i saw vanity under the sun there is one alone and there is not a second yea he hathneither child nor brother yet is there no end of all his labourneither is his eye satisfied with riches neither saith he for whomdo i labour and bereave my soul of good this is also vanity yea itis a sore travail two are better than one because they have a good reward for theirlabour for if they fall the one will lift up his fellow but woe to himthat is alone when he falleth for he hath not another to help him up again if two lie together then they have heat but how can onebe warm alone   and if one prevail against him two shallwithstand him and a threefold cord is not quickly broken better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish kingwho will no more be admonished for out of prison he cometh to reign whereas also he that isborn in his kingdom becometh poor i considered all the living which walk under the sun with thesecond child that shall stand up in his stead there is no end of all the people even of all that have beenbefore them they also that come after shall not rejoice in himsurely this also is vanity and vexation of spirit keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of god and be moreready to hear than to give the sacrifice of fools for they considernot that they do evil be not rash with thy mouth and let not thine heart be hasty toutter any thing before god for god is in heaven and thou upon earththerefore let thy words be few for a dream cometh through the multitude of business and a foolsvoice is known by multitude of words when thou vowest a vow unto god defer not to pay it for he hathno pleasure in fools pay that which thou hast vowed better is it that thou shouldest not vow than that thou shouldestvow and not pay suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin neither say thoubefore the angel that it was an error wherefore should god be angryat thy voice and destroy the work of thine hands   for in themultitude of dreams and many words there are also divers vanities butfear thou god if thou seest the oppression of the poor and violent pervertingof judgment and justice in a province marvel not at the matter forhe that is higher than the highest regardeth and there be higher thanthey moreover the profit of the earth is for all the king himself isserved by the field he that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver nor hethat loveth abundance with increase this is also vanity when goods increase they are increased that eat them and whatgood is there to the owners thereof saving the beholding of them withtheir eyes   the sleep of a labouring man is sweet whether heeat little or much but the abundance of the rich will not suffer himto sleep there is a sore evil which i have seen under the sun namelyriches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt but those riches perish by evil travail and he begetteth a sonand there is nothing in his hand as he came forth of his mothers womb naked shall he return togo as he came and shall take nothing of his labour which he maycarry away in his hand and this also is a sore evil that in all points as he came soshall he go and what profit hath he that hath laboured for the wind all his days also he eateth in darkness and he hath much sorrowand wrath with his sickness behold that which i have seen it is good and comely for one toeat and to drink and to enjoy the good of all his labour that hetaketh under the sun all the days of his life which god giveth himfor it is his portion every man also to whom god hath given riches and wealth and hathgiven him power to eat thereof and to take his portion and torejoice in his labour this is the gift of god for he shall not much remember the days of his life because godanswereth him in the joy of his heart there is an evil which i have seen under the sun and it is commonamong men  a man to whom god hath given riches wealth andhonour so that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that hedesireth yet god giveth him not power to eat thereof but a strangereateth it this is vanity and it is an evil disease if a man beget an hundred children and live many years so thatthe days of his years be many and his soul be not filled with goodand also that he have no burial i say that an untimely birth isbetter than he for he cometh in with vanity and departeth in darkness and hisname shall be covered with darkness moreover he hath not seen the sun nor known any thing this hathmore rest than the other yea though he live a thousand years twice told yet hath he seenno good do not all go to one place   all the labour of man is forhis mouth and yet the appetite is not filled for what hath the wise more than the fool what hath the poorthat knoweth to walk before the living   better is the sight ofthe eyes than the wandering of the desire this is also vanity andvexation of spirit that which hath been is named already and it is known that it isman neither may he contend with him that is mightier than he seeing there be many things that increase vanity what is man thebetter   for who knoweth what is good for man in this life allthe days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow for who cantell a man what shall be after him under the sun   a good name isbetter than precious ointment and the day of death than the day ofones birth it is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to thehouse of feasting for that is the end of all men and the living willlay it to his heart sorrow is better than laughter for by the sadness of thecountenance the heart is made better the heart of the wise is in the house of mourning but the heartof fools is in the house of mirth it is better to hear the rebuke of the wise than for a man tohear the song of fools for as the crackling of thorns under a pot so is the laughter ofthe fool this also is vanity surely oppression maketh a wise man mad and a gift destroyeth theheart better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof and thepatient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry for anger resteth in thebosom of fools say not thou what is the cause that the former days were betterthan these for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this wisdom is good with an inheritance and by it there is profit tothem that see the sun for wisdom is a defence and money is a defence but theexcellency of knowledge is that wisdom giveth life to them that haveit consider the work of god for who can make that straight whichhe hath made crooked   in the day of prosperity be joyful but inthe day of adversity consider god also hath set the one over againstthe other to the end that man should find nothing after him all things have i seen in the days of my vanity there is a justman that perisheth in his righteousness and there is a wicked manthat prolongeth his life in his wickedness be not righteous over much neither make thyself over wise whyshouldest thou destroy thyself    be not over much wickedneither be thou foolish why shouldest thou die before thy time  it is good that thou shouldest take hold of this yea also from thiswithdraw not thine hand for he that feareth god shall come forth ofthem all wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty men which arein the city for there is not a just man upon earth that doeth good andsinneth not also take no heed unto all words that are spoken lest thou hearthy servant curse thee  for oftentimes also thine own heartknoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others all this have i proved by wisdom i said i will be wise but itwas far from me that which is far off and exceeding deep who can find it out i applied mine heart to know and to search and to seek outwisdom and the reason of things and to know the wickedness of follyeven of foolishness and madness  and i find more bitter thandeath the woman whose heart is snares and nets and her hands asbands whoso pleaseth god shall escape from her but the sinner shallbe taken by her behold this have i found saith the preacher counting one byone to find out the account  which yet my soul seeketh but ifind not one man among a thousand have i found but a woman among allthose have i not found lo this only have i found that god hath made man upright butthey have sought out many inventions who is as the wise man and who knoweth the interpretation of athing  a mans wisdom maketh his face to shine and the boldness ofhis face shall be changed i counsel thee to keep the kings commandment and that in regardof the oath of god be not hasty to go out of his sight stand not in an evil thingfor he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him where the word of a king is there is power and who may say untohim what doest thou   whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel noevil thing and a wise mans heart discerneth both time and judgment because to every purpose there is time and judgment therefore themisery of man is great upon him for he knoweth not that which shall be for who can tell him whenit shall be   there is no man that hath power over the spirit toretain the spirit neither hath he power in the day of death andthere is no discharge in that war neither shall wickedness deliverthose that are given to it all this have i seen and applied my heart unto every work that isdone under the sun there is a time wherein one man ruleth overanother to his own hurt and so i saw the wicked buried who had come and gone from theplace of the holy and they were forgotten in the city where they hadso done this is also vanity because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedilytherefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to doevil though a sinner do evil an hundred times and his days beprolonged yet surely i know that it shall be well with them that feargod which fear before him  but it shall not be well with thewicked neither shall he prolong his days which are as a shadowbecause he feareth not before god there is a vanity which is done upon the earth that there bejust men unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wickedagain there be wicked men to whom it happeneth according to the workof the righteous i said that this also is vanity then i commended mirth because a man hath no better thing underthe sun than to eat and to drink and to be merry for that shallabide with him of his labour the days of his life which god givethhim under the sun when i applied mine heart to know wisdom and to see the businessthat is done upon the earth for also there is that neither day nornight seeth sleep with his eyes  then i beheld all the work ofgod that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sunbecause though a man labour to seek it out yet he shall not find ityea farther though a wise man think to know it yet shall he not beable to find it for all this i considered in my heart even to declare all thisthat the righteous and the wise and their works are in the hand ofgod no man knoweth either love or hatred by all that is before them all things come alike to all there is one event to the righteousand to the wicked to the good and to the clean and to the uncleanto him that sacrificeth and to him that sacrificeth not as is thegood so is the sinner and he that sweareth as he that feareth anoath this is an evil among all things that are done under the sun thatthere is one event unto all yea also the heart of the sons of men isfull of evil and madness is in their heart while they live and afterthat they go to the dead for to him that is joined to all the living there is hope for aliving dog is better than a dead lion for the living know that they shall die but the dead know not anything neither have they any more a reward for the memory of them isforgotten also their love and their hatred and their envy is nowperished neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thingthat is done under the sun go thy way eat thy bread with joy and drink thy wine with amerry heart for god now accepteth thy works let thy garments be always white and let thy head lack noointment live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of thelife of thy vanity which he hath given thee under the sun all thedays of thy vanity for that is thy portion in this life and in thylabour which thou takest under the sun whatsoever thy hand findeth to do do it with thy might forthere is no work nor device nor knowledge nor wisdom in the gravewhither thou goest i returned and saw under the sun that the race is not to theswift nor the battle to the strong neither yet bread to the wisenor yet riches to men of understanding nor yet favour to men ofskill but time and chance happeneth to them all for man also knoweth not his time as the fishes that are takenin an evil net and as the birds that are caught in the snare so arethe sons of men snared in an evil time when it falleth suddenly uponthem this wisdom have i seen also under the sun and it seemed greatunto me  there was a little city and few men within it andthere came a great king against it and besieged it and built greatbulwarks against it  now there was found in it a poor wise manand he by his wisdom delivered the city yet no man remembered thatsame poor man then said i wisdom is better than strength nevertheless thepoor mans wisdom is despised and his words are not heard the words of wise men are heard in quiet more than the cry of himthat ruleth among fools wisdom is better than weapons of war but one sinner destroyethmuch good dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth astinking savour so doth a little folly him that is in reputation forwisdom and honour a wise mans heart is at his right hand but a fools heart athis left yea also when he that is a fool walketh by the way his wisdomfaileth him and he saith to every one that he is a fool if the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee leave not thyplace for yielding pacifieth great offences there is an evil which i have seen under the sun as an errorwhich proceedeth from the ruler  folly is set in great dignityand the rich sit in low place i have seen servants upon horses and princes walking as servantsupon the earth he that diggeth a pit shall fall into it and whoso breaketh anhedge a serpent shall bite him whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith and he thatcleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby if the iron be blunt and he do not whet the edge then must heput to more strength but wisdom is profitable to direct surely the serpent will bite without enchantment and a babbleris no better the words of a wise mans mouth are gracious but the lips of afool will swallow up himself the beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness and theend of his talk is mischievous madness a fool also is full of words a man cannot tell what shall beand what shall be after him who can tell him   the labour ofthe foolish wearieth every one of them because he knoweth not how togo to the city woe to thee o land when thy king is a child and thy princeseat in the morning   blessed art thou o land when thy king isthe son of nobles and thy princes eat in due season for strengthand not for drunkenness   by much slothfulness the buildingdecayeth and through idleness of the hands the house droppeththrough a feast is made for laughter and wine maketh merry but moneyanswereth all things curse not the king no not in thy thought and curse not therich in thy bedchamber for a bird of the air shall carry the voiceand that which hath wings shall tell the matter cast thy bread upon the waters for thou shalt find it after manydays give a portion to seven and also to eight for thou knowest notwhat evil shall be upon the earth if the clouds be full of rain they empty themselves upon theearth and if the tree fall toward the south or toward the north inthe place where the tree falleth there it shall be he that observeth the wind shall not sow and he that regardeththe clouds shall not reap as thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit nor how thebones do grow in the womb of her that is with child even so thouknowest not the works of god who maketh all in the morning sow thy seed and in the evening withhold notthine hand for thou knowest not whether shall prosper either this orthat or whether they both shall be alike good truly the light is sweet and a pleasant thing it is for the eyesto behold the sun  but if a man live many years and rejoice inthem all yet let him remember the days of darkness for they shall bemany all that cometh is vanity rejoice o young man in thy youth and let thy heart cheer theein the days of thy youth and walk in the ways of thine heart and inthe sight of thine eyes but know thou that for all these things godwill bring thee into judgment therefore remove sorrow from thy heart and put away evil fromthy flesh for childhood and youth are vanity remember now thy creator in the days of thy youth while the evildays come not nor the years draw nigh when thou shalt say i have nopleasure in them  while the sun or the light or the moon orthe stars be not darkened nor the clouds return after the rain in the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble and the strongmen shall bow themselves and the grinders cease because they are fewand those that look out of the windows be darkened  and the doorsshall be shut in the streets when the sound of the grinding is lowand he shall rise up at the voice of the bird and all the daughtersof musick shall be brought low  also when they shall be afraid ofthat which is high and fears shall be in the way and the almond treeshall flourish and the grasshopper shall be a burden and desireshall fail because man goeth to his long home and the mourners goabout the streets  or ever the silver cord be loosed or thegolden bowl be broken or the pitcher be broken at the fountain orthe wheel broken at the cistern then shall the dust return to the earth as it was and the spiritshall return unto god who gave it vanity of vanities saith the preacher all is vanity and moreover because the preacher was wise he still taught thepeople knowledge yea he gave good heed and sought out and set inorder many proverbs the preacher sought to find out acceptable words and that whichwas written was upright even words of truth the words of the wise are as goads and as nails fastened by themasters of assemblies which are given from one shepherd and further by these my son be admonished of making manybooks there is no end and much study is a weariness of the flesh let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter fear god andkeep his commandments for this is the whole duty of man for god shall bring every work into judgment with every secretthing whether it be good or whether it be evilthe song of solomon the song of songs which is solomons let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth for thy love isbetter than wine because of the savour of thy good ointments thy name is asointment poured forth therefore do the virgins love thee draw me we will run after thee the king hath brought me into hischambers we will be glad and rejoice in thee we will remember thylove more than wine the upright love thee i am black but comely o ye daughters of jerusalem as the tentsof kedar as the curtains of solomon look not upon me because i am black because the sun hath lookedupon me my mothers children were angry with me they made me thekeeper of the vineyards but mine own vineyard have i not kept tell me o thou whom my soul loveth where thou feedest wherethou makest thy flock to rest at noon for why should i be as one thatturneth aside by the flocks of thy companions   if thou know noto thou fairest among women go thy way forth by the footsteps of theflock and feed thy kids beside the shepherds tents i have compared thee o my love to a company of horses inpharaohs chariots thy cheeks are comely with rows of jewels thy neck with chainsof gold we will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver while the king sitteth at his table my spikenard sendeth forththe smell thereof a bundle of myrrh is my wellbeloved unto me he shall lie allnight betwixt my breasts my beloved is unto me as a cluster of

people laden with iniquity a seed ofevildoers children that are corrupters they have forsaken the lordthey have provoked the holy one of israel unto anger they are goneaway backward why should ye be stricken any more ye will revolt more and morethe whole head is sick and the whole heart faint from the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundnessin it but wounds and bruises and putrifying sores they have notbeen closed neither bound up neither mollified with ointment your country is desolate your cities are burned with fire yourland strangers devour it in your presence and it is desolate asoverthrown by strangers and the daughter of zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard as alodge in a garden of cucumbers as a besieged city except the lord of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant weshould have been as sodom and we should have been like unto gomorrah hear the word of the lord ye rulers of sodom give ear unto thelaw of our god ye people of gomorrah to what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto mesaith the lord i am full of the burnt offerings of rams and the fatof fed beasts and i delight not in the blood of bullocks or oflambs or of he goats

as white as snow though they be redlike crimson they shall be as wool if ye be willing and obedient ye shall eat the good of the land but if ye refuse and rebel ye shall be devoured with the swordfor the mouth of the lord hath spoken it how is the faithful city become an harlot it was full ofjudgment righteousness lodged in it but now murderers thy silver is become dross thy wine mixed with water  thyprinces are rebellious and companions of thieves every one lovethgifts and followeth after rewards they judge not the fatherlessneither doth the cause of the widow come unto them therefore saith

judgment and her converts withrighteousness and the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners shallbe together and they that forsake the lord shall be consumed for they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired andye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen for ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth and as a garden thathath no water and the strong shall be as tow and the maker of it as a sparkand they shall both burn together and none shall quench them the word that isaiah the son of amoz saw concerning judah andjerusalem and it shall come to pass in the last days that the mountain ofthe lords house shall be established in the top of the mountains andshall be exalted above the hills and all nations shall flow unto it and many people shall go and say come ye and let us go up to themountain of the lord to the house of the god of jacob and he willteach us of his ways and we will walk in his paths for out of zionshall go forth the law and the word of the lord from jerusalem and he shall judge among the nations and shall rebuke manypeople and they shall beat their swords into plowshares and theirspears into pruninghooks nation shall not lift up sword againstnation neither shall they learn war any more o house of jacob come ye and let us walk in the light of thelord therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of jacobbecause they be replenished from the east and are soothsayers likethe philistines and they please themselves in the children ofstrangers their land also is full of silver and gold neither is there anyend of their treasures their land is also full of horses neither isthere any end of their chariots  their land also is full of idolsthey worship the work of their own hands that which their own fingershave made  and the mean man boweth down and the great manhumbleth himself therefore forgive them not enter into the rock and hide thee in the dust for fear of thelord and for the glory of his majesty the lofty looks of man shall be humbled and the haughtiness ofmen shall be bowed down and the lord alone shall be exalted in thatday for the day of the lord of hosts shall be upon every one that isproud and lofty and upon every one that is lifted up and he shall bebrought low  and upon all the cedars of lebanon that are highand lifted up and upon all the oaks of bashan  and upon all thehigh mountains and upon all the hills that are lifted up  andupon every high tower and upon every fenced wall  and upon allthe ships of tarshish and upon all pleasant pictures and the loftiness of man shall be bowed down and the haughtinessof men shall be made low and the lord alone shall be exalted in thatday and the idols he shall utterly abolish and they shall go into the holes of the rocks and into the cavesof the earth for fear of the lord and for the glory of his majestywhen he ariseth to shake terribly the earth in that day a man shall cast his idols of silver and his idolsof gold which they made each one for himself to worship to the molesand to the bats  to go into the clefts of the rocks and into thetops of the ragged rocks for fear of the lord and for the glory ofhis majesty when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth cease ye from man whose breath is in his nostrils for whereinis he to be accounted of    for behold the lord the lord ofhosts doth take away from jerusalem and from judah the stay and thestaff the whole stay of bread and the whole stay of water the mighty man and the man of war the judge and the prophetand the prudent and the ancient  the captain of fifty and thehonourable man and the counsellor and the cunning artificer and theeloquent orator and i will give children to be their princes and babes shall ruleover them and the people shall be oppressed every one by another and everyone by his neighbour the child shall behave himself proudly againstthe ancient and the base against the honourable when a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of hisfather saying thou hast clothing be thou our ruler and let thisruin be under thy hand  in that day shall he swear saying i willnot be an healer for in my house is neither bread nor clothing makeme not a ruler of the people for jerusalem is ruined and judah is fallen because their tongueand their doings are against the lord to provoke the eyes of hisglory the shew of their countenance doth witness against them and theydeclare their sin as sodom they hide it not woe unto their soul forthey have rewarded evil unto themselves say ye to the righteous that it shall be well with him for theyshall eat the fruit of their doings woe unto the wicked it shall be ill with him for the reward ofhis hands shall be given him as for my people children are their oppressors and women ruleover them o my people they which lead thee cause thee to err anddestroy the way of thy paths the lord standeth up to plead and standeth to judge the people the lord will enter into judgment with the ancients of hispeople and the princes thereof for ye have eaten up the vineyardthe spoil of the poor is in your houses what mean ye that ye beat my people to pieces and grind thefaces of the poor saith the lord god of hosts moreover the lord saith because the daughters of zion arehaughty and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes walkingand mincing as they go and making a tinkling with their feet therefore the lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of thedaughters of zion and the lord will discover their secret parts in that day the lord will take away the bravery of their tinklingornaments about their feet and their cauls and their round tireslike the moon  the chains and the bracelets and the mufflers the bonnets and the ornaments of the legs and the headbandsand the tablets and the earrings  the rings and nose jewels the changeable suits of apparel and the mantles and thewimples and the crisping pins  the glasses and the fine linenand the hoods and the vails and it shall come to pass that instead of sweet smell thereshall be stink and instead of a girdle a rent and instead of wellset hair baldness and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackclothand burning instead of beauty thy men shall fall by the sword and thy mighty in the war and her gates shall lament and mourn and she being desolateshall sit upon the ground and in that day seven women shall take hold of one man saying wewill eat our own bread and wear our own apparel only let us becalled by thy name to take away our reproach in that day shall the branch of the lord be beautiful andglorious and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely forthem that are escaped of israel and it shall come to pass that he that is left in zion and hethat remaineth in jerusalem shall be called holy even every one thatis written among the living in jerusalem  when the lord shall havewashed away the filth of the daughters of zion and shall have purgedthe blood of jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit ofjudgment and by the spirit of burning and the lord will create upon every dwelling place of mount zionand upon her assemblies a cloud and smoke by day and the shining ofa flaming fire by night for upon all the glory shall be a defence and there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the day time fromthe heat and for a place of refuge and for a covert from storm andfrom rain now will i sing to my wellbeloved a song of my beloved touchinghis vineyard my wellbeloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill and he fenced it and gathered out the stones thereof and plantedit with the choicest vine and built a tower in the midst of it andalso made a winepress therein and he looked that it should bringforth grapes and it brought forth wild grapes and now o inhabitants of jerusalem and men of judah judge ipray you betwixt me and my vineyard what could have been done more to my vineyard that i have notdone in it wherefore when i looked that it should bring forthgrapes brought it forth wild grapes   and now go to i will tellyou what i will do to my vineyard i will take away the hedge thereofand it shall be eaten up and break down the wall thereof and itshall be trodden down  and i will lay it waste it shall not bepruned nor digged but there shall come up briers and thorns i willalso command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it for the vineyard of the lord of hosts is the house of israel andthe men of judah his pleasant plant and he looked for judgment butbehold oppression for righteousness but behold a cry woe unto them that join house to house that lay field to fieldtill there be no place that they may be placed alone in the midst ofthe earth   in mine ears said the lord of hosts of a truth manyhouses shall be desolate even great and fair without inhabitant yea ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath and the seed ofan homer shall yield an ephah woe unto them that rise up early in the morning that they mayfollow strong drink that continue until night till wine inflamethem   and the harp and the viol the tabret and pipe andwine are in their feasts but they regard not the work of the lordneither consider the operation of his hands therefore my people are gone into captivity because they have noknowledge and their honourable men are famished and their multitudedried up with thirst therefore hell hath enlarged herself and opened her mouthwithout measure and their glory and their multitude and their pompand he that rejoiceth shall descend into it and the mean man shall be brought down and the mighty man shallbe humbled and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled  but thelord of hosts shall be exalted in judgment and god that is holy shallbe sanctified in righteousness then shall the lambs feed after their manner and the wasteplaces of the fat ones shall strangers eat woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity and sin asit were with a cart rope  that say let him make speed andhasten his work that we may see it and let the counsel of the holyone of israel draw nigh and come that we may know it   woe untothem that call evil good and good evil that put darkness for lightand light for darkness that put bitter for sweet and sweet forbitter   woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes andprudent in their own sight   woe unto them that are mighty todrink wine and men of strength to mingle strong drink  whichjustify the wicked for reward and take away the righteousness of therighteous from him   therefore as the fire devoureth the stubbleand the flame consumeth the chaff so their root shall be asrottenness and their blossom shall go up as dust because they havecast away the law of the lord of hosts and despised the word of theholy one of israel therefore is the anger of the lord kindled against his peopleand he hath stretched forth his hand against them and hath smittenthem and the hills did tremble and their carcases were torn in themidst of the streetsfor all this his anger is not turned away but his hand is stretchedout still and he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far and willhiss unto them from the end of the earth and behold they shall comewith speed swiftly  none shall be weary nor stumble among themnone shall slumber nor sleep neither shall the girdle of their loinsbe loosed nor the latchet of their shoes be broken  whose arrowsare sharp and all their bows bent their horses hoofs shall becounted like flint and their wheels like a whirlwind  theirroaring shall be like a lion they shall roar like young lions yeathey shall roar and lay hold of the prey and shall carry it awaysafe and none shall deliver it and in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring ofthe sea and if one look unto the land behold darkness and sorrowand the light is darkened in the heavens thereof in the year that king uzziah died i saw also the lord sitting upona throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple above it stood the seraphims each one had six wings with twainhe covered his face and with twain he covered his feet and withtwain he did fly and one cried unto another and said holy holy holy is thelord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory and the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that criedand the house was filled with smoke then said i woe is me for i am undone because i am a man ofunclean lips and i dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lipsfor mine eyes have seen the king the lord of hosts then flew one of the seraphims unto me having a live coal in hishand which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar  and helaid it upon my mouth and said lo this hath touched thy lips andthine iniquity is taken away and thy sin purged also i heard the voice of the lord saying whom shall i send andwho will go for us then said i here am i send me and he said go and tell this people hear ye indeed butunderstand not and see ye indeed but perceive not make the heart of this people fat and make their ears heavy andshut their eyes lest they see with their eyes and hear with theirears and understand with their heart and convert and be healed then said i lord how long and he answered until the cities bewasted without inhabitant and the houses without man and the land beutterly desolate  and the lord have removed men far away andthere be a great forsaking in the midst of the land but yet in it shall be a tenth and it shall return and shall beeaten as a teil tree and as an oak whose substance is in them whenthey cast their leaves so the holy seed shall be the substancethereof and it came to pass in the days of ahaz the son of jotham the sonof uzziah king of judah that rezin the king of syria and pekah theson of remaliah king of israel went up toward jerusalem to waragainst it but could not prevail against it and it was told the house of david saying syria is confederatewith ephraim and his heart was moved and the heart of his people asthe trees of the wood are moved with the wind then said the lord unto isaiah go forth now to meet ahaz thouand shearjashub thy son at the end of the conduit of the upper poolin the highway of the fullers field  and say unto him take heedand be quiet fear not neither be fainthearted for the two tails ofthese smoking firebrands for the fierce anger of rezin with syriaand of the son of remaliah because syria ephraim and the son of remaliah have taken evilcounsel against thee saying  let us go up against judah and vexit and let us make a breach therein for us and set a king in themidst of it even the son of tabeal  thus saith the lord god itshall not stand neither shall it come to pass for the head of syria is damascus and the head of damascus isrezin and within threescore and five years shall ephraim be brokenthat it be not a people and the head of ephraim is samaria and the head of samaria isremaliahs son if ye will not believe surely ye shall not beestablished moreover the lord spake again unto ahaz saying  ask thee asign of the lord thy god ask it either in the depth or in the heightabove but ahaz said i will not ask neither will i tempt the lord and he said hear ye now o house of david is it a small thingfor you to weary men but will ye weary my god also   thereforethe lord himself shall give you a sign behold a virgin shallconceive and bear a son and shall call his name immanuel butter and honey shall he eat that he may know to refuse theevil and choose the good for before the child shall know to refuse the evil and choosethe good the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both herkings the lord shall bring upon thee and upon thy people and upon thyfathers house days that have not come from the day that ephraimdeparted from judah even the king of assyria and it shall come to pass in that day that the lord shall hissfor the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of egypt andfor the bee that is in the land of assyria and they shall come and shall rest all of them in the desolatevalleys and in the holes of the rocks and upon all thorns and uponall bushes in the same day shall the lord shave with a razor that is hirednamely by them beyond the river by the king of assyria the headand the hair of the feet and it shall also consume the beard and it shall come to pass in that day that a man shall nourish ayoung cow and two sheep  and it shall come to pass for theabundance of milk that they shall give he shall eat butter for butterand honey shall every one eat that is left in the land and it shall come to pass in that day that every place shall bewhere there were a thousand vines at a thousand silverlings it shalleven be for briers and thorns with arrows and with bows shall men come thither because all theland shall become briers and thorns and on all hills that shall be digged with the mattock thereshall not come thither the fear of briers and thorns but it shall befor the sending forth of oxen and for the treading of lesser cattle moreover the lord said unto me take thee a great roll and writein it with a mans pen concerning mahershalalhashbaz and i took unto me faithful witnesses to record uriah the priestand zechariah the son of jeberechiah and i went unto the prophetess and she conceived and bare a sonthen said the lord to me call his name mahershalalhashbaz for before the child shall have knowledge to cry my father andmy mother the riches of damascus and the spoil of samaria shall betaken away before the king of assyria the lord spake also unto me again saying  forasmuch as thispeople refuseth the waters of shiloah that go softly and rejoice inrezin and remaliahs son  now therefore behold the lord bringethup upon them the waters of the river strong and many even the kingof assyria and all his glory and he shall come up over all hischannels and go over all his banks  and he shall pass throughjudah he shall overflow and go over he shall reach even to the neckand the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thyland o immanuel associate yourselves o ye people and ye shall be broken inpieces and give ear all ye of far countries gird yourselves and yeshall be broken in pieces gird yourselves and ye shall be broken inpieces take counsel together and it shall come to nought speak theword and it shall not stand for god is with us for the lord spake thus to me with a strong hand and instructedme that i should not walk in the way of this people saying  sayye not a confederacy to all them to whom this people shall say aconfederacy neither fear ye their fear nor be afraid sanctify the lord of hosts himself and let him be your fear andlet him be your dread and he shall be for a sanctuary but for a stone of stumbling andfor a rock of offence to both the houses of israel for a gin and fora snare to the inhabitants of jerusalem and many among them shall stumble and fall and be broken andbe snared and be taken bind up the testimony seal the law among my disciples and i will wait upon the lord that hideth his face from thehouse of jacob and i will look for him behold i and the children whom the lord hath given me are forsigns and for wonders in israel from the lord of hosts which dwellethin mount zion and when they shall say unto you seek unto them that havefamiliar spirits and unto wizards that peep and that mutter shouldnot a people seek unto their god for the living to the dead   tothe law and to the testimony if they speak not according to thisword it is because there is no light in them and they shall pass through it hardly bestead and hungry and itshall come to pass that when they shall be hungry they shall fretthemselves and curse their king and their god and look upward and they shall look unto the earth and behold trouble anddarkness dimness of anguish and they shall be driven to darkness nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her vexationwhen at the first he lightly afflicted the land of zebulun and theland of naphtali and afterward did more grievously afflict her by theway of the sea beyond jordan in galilee of the nations the people that walked in darkness have seen a great light theythat dwell in the land of the shadow of death upon them hath thelight shined thou hast multiplied the nation and not increased the joy theyjoy before thee according to the joy in harvest and as men rejoicewhen they divide the spoil for thou hast broken the yoke of his burden and the staff of hisshoulder the rod of his oppressor as in the day of midian for every battle of the warrior is with confused noise andgarments rolled in blood but this shall be with burning and fuel offire for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and thegovernment shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be calledwonderful counsellor the mighty god the everlasting father theprince of peace of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no endupon the throne of david and upon his kingdom to order it and toestablish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even forever the zeal of the lord of hosts will perform this the lord sent a word into jacob and it hath lighted upon israel and all the people shall know even ephraim and the inhabitant ofsamaria that say in the pride and stoutness of heart  the bricksare fallen down but we will build with hewn stones the sycomores arecut down but we will change them into cedars therefore the lord shall set up the adversaries of rezin againsthim and join his enemies together  the syrians before and thephilistines behind and they shall devour israel with open mouth forall this his anger is not turned away but his hand is stretched outstill for the people turneth not unto him that smiteth them neither dothey seek the lord of hosts therefore the lord will cut off from israel head and tail branchand rush in one day the ancient and honourable he is the head and the prophet thatteacheth lies he is the tail for the leaders of this people cause them to err and they thatare led of them are destroyed therefore the lord shall have no joy in their young men neithershall have mercy on their fatherless and widows for every one is anhypocrite and an evildoer and every mouth speaketh folly for allthis his anger is not turned away but his hand is stretched outstill for wickedness burneth as the fire it shall devour the briersand thorns and shall kindle in the thickets of the forest and theyshall mount up like the lifting up of smoke through the wrath of the lord of hosts is the land darkened andthe people shall be as the fuel of the fire no man shall spare hisbrother and he shall snatch on the right hand and be hungry and heshall eat on the left hand and they shall not be satisfied theyshall eat every man the flesh of his own arm

fatherless and what will ye do in the day of visitation and in thedesolation which shall come from far to whom will ye flee for helpand where will ye leave your glory   without me they shall bowdown under the prisoners and they shall fall under the slain for allthis his anger is not turned away but his hand is stretched outstill o assyrian the rod of mine anger and the staff in their hand ismine indignation i will send him against an hypocritical nation and against thepeople of my wrath will i give him a charge to take the spoil and totake the prey and to tread them down like the mire of the streets howbeit he meaneth not so neither doth his heart think so butit is in his heart to destroy and cut off nations not a few for he saith are not my princes altogether kings   is notcalno as carchemish is not hamath as arpad is not samaria asdamascus   as my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols andwhose graven images did excel them of jerusalem and of samaria shall i not as i have done unto samaria and her idols so do tojerusalem and her idols   wherefore it shall come to pass thatwhen the lord hath performed his whole work upon mount zion and onjerusalem i will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king ofassyria and the glory of his high looks for he saith by the strength of my hand i have done it and bymy wisdom for i am prudent and i have removed the bounds of thepeople and have robbed their treasures and i have put down theinhabitants like a valiant man  and my hand hath found as a nestthe riches of the people and as one gathereth eggs that are lefthave i gathered all the earth and there was none that moved the wingor opened the mouth or peeped shall the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith orshall the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh it as if therod should shake itself against them that lift it up or as if thestaff should lift up itself as if it were no wood therefore shall the lord the lord of hosts send among his fatones leanness and under his glory he shall kindle a burning like theburning of a fire and the light of israel shall be for a fire and his holy onefor a flame and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers inone day  and shall consume the glory of his forest and of hisfruitful field both soul and body and they shall be as when astandardbearer fainteth and the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few that achild may write them and it shall come to pass in that day that the remnant ofisrael and such as are escaped of the house of jacob shall no moreagain stay upon him that smote them but shall stay upon the lord theholy one of israel in truth the remnant shall return even the remnant of jacob unto themighty god for though thy people israel be as the sand of the sea yet aremnant of them shall return the consumption decreed shall overflowwith righteousness for the lord god of hosts shall make a consumption evendetermined in the midst of all the land therefore thus saith the lord god of hosts o my people thatdwellest in zion be not afraid of the assyrian he shall smite theewith a rod and shall lift up his staff against thee after the mannerof egypt for yet a very little while and the indignation shall ceaseand mine anger in their destruction and the lord of hosts shall stir up a scourge for him accordingto the slaughter of midian at the rock of oreb and as his rod wasupon the sea so shall he lift it up after the manner of egypt and it shall come to pass in that day that his burden shall betaken away from off thy shoulder and his yoke from off thy neck andthe yoke shall

of the fearof the lord  and shall make him of quick understanding in thefear of the lord and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyesneither reprove after the hearing of his ears  but withrighteousness shall he judge the poor and reprove with equity for themeek of the earth and he shall smite the earth with the rod of hismouth and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked and righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins andfaithfulness the girdle of his reins the wolf also shall dwell with the lamb and the leopard shalllie down with the kid and the calf and

remnant howl o gate cry o city thou whole palestina art dissolvedfor there shall come from the north a smoke and none shall be alonein his appointed times what shall one then answer the messengers of the nation thatthe lord hath founded zion and the poor of his people shall trust init the burden of moab because in the night ar of moab is laidwaste and brought to silence because in the night kir of moab islaid waste and brought to silence  he is gone up to bajith andto dibon the high places to weep moab shall howl over nebo andover medeba on all their heads shall be baldness and every beard cutoff in their streets they shall gird themselves with sackcloth onthe tops of their houses and in their streets every one shall howlweeping abundantly and heshbon shall cry and elealeh their voice shall be heardeven unto jahaz therefore the armed soldiers of moab shall cry outhis life shall be grievous unto him my heart shall cry out for moab his fugitives shall flee untozoar an heifer of three years old for by the mounting up of luhithwith weeping shall they go it up for in the way of horonaim theyshall raise up a cry of destruction for the waters of nimrim shall be desolate for the hay iswithered away the grass faileth there is no green thing therefore the abundance they have gotten and that which theyhave laid up shall they carry away to the brook of the willows for the cry is gone round about the borders of moab the howlingthereof unto eglaim and the howling thereof unto beerelim for the waters of dimon shall be full of blood for i will bringmore upon dimon lions upon him that escapeth of moab and upon theremnant of the land send ye the lamb to the ruler of the land from sela to thewilderness unto the mount of the daughter of zion for it shall be that as a wandering bird

land and in mercy shall the throne be established and he shall situpon it in truth in the tabernacle of david judging and seekingjudgment and hasting righteousness we have heard of the pride of moab he is very proud even of hishaughtiness and his pride and his wrath but his lies shall not beso therefore shall moab howl for moab every one shall howl for thefoundations of kirhareseth shall ye mourn surely they are stricken for the fields of heshbon languish and the vine of sibmah thelords of the heathen have broken down the principal plants thereofthey are come even unto jazer they wandered through the wildernessher branches are stretched out they are gone over the sea therefore i will bewail with the weeping of jazer the vine ofsibmah i will water thee with my tears o heshbon and elealeh forthe shouting for thy summer fruits and for thy harvest is fallen and gladness is taken away and joy out of the plentiful fieldand in the vineyards there shall be no singing neither shall there beshouting the treaders shall tread out no wine in their presses ihave made their vintage shouting to cease wherefore my bowels shall sound like an harp for moab and mineinward parts for kirharesh and it shall come to pass when it is seen that moab is weary onthe high place that he shall come to his sanctuary to pray but heshall not prevail this is the word that the lord hath spoken concerning moab sincethat time but now the lord hath spoken saying within three years as theyears of an hireling and the glory of moab shall be contemned withall that great multitude and the remnant shall be very small andfeeble the burden of damascus behold damascus is taken away from beinga city and it shall be a ruinous heap the cities of aroer are forsaken they shall be for flocks whichshall lie down and none shall make them afraid the fortress also shall cease from ephraim and the kingdom fromdamascus and the remnant of syria they shall be as the glory of thechildren of israel saith the lord of hosts and in that day it shall come to pass that the glory of jacobshall be made thin and the fatness of his flesh shall wax lean and it shall be as when the harvestman gathereth the corn andreapeth the ears with his arm and it shall be as he that gatherethears in the valley of rephaim yet gleaning grapes shall be left in it as the shaking of anolive tree two or three berries in the top of the uppermost boughfour or five in the outmost fruitful branches thereof saith the lordgod of israel at that day shall a man look to his maker and his eyes shallhave respect to the holy one of israel and he shall not look to the altars the work of his handsneither shall respect that which his fingers have made either thegroves or the images in that day shall his strong cities be as a forsaken bough andan uppermost branch which they left because of the children ofisrael and there shall be desolation because thou hast forgotten the god of thy salvation and hastnot been mindful of the rock of thy strength therefore shalt thouplant pleasant plants and shalt set it with strange slips  inthe day shalt thou make thy plant to grow and in the morning shaltthou make thy seed to flourish but the harvest shall be a heap in theday of grief and of desperate sorrow woe to the multitude of many people which make a noise like thenoise of the seas and to the rushing of nations that make a rushinglike the rushing of mighty waters   the nations shall rush likethe rushing of many waters but god shall rebuke them and they shallflee far off and shall be chased as the chaff of the mountains beforethe wind and like a rolling thing before the whirlwind and behold at eveningtide trouble and before the morning he isnotthis is the portion of them that spoil us and the lot of them thatrob us woe to the land shadowing with wings which is beyond the riversof ethiopia  that sendeth ambassadors by the sea even in vesselsof bulrushes upon the waters saying go ye swift messengers to

onthe earth see ye when he lifteth up an ensign on the mountains andwhen he bloweth a trumpet hear ye for so the lord said unto me i will take my rest and i willconsider in my dwelling place like a clear heat upon herbs and like acloud of dew in the heat of harvest for afore the harvest when the bud is perfect and the sourgrape is ripening in the flower he shall both cut off the sprigs withpruning hooks and take away and cut down the branches they shall be left together unto the fowls of the mountains andto the beasts of the earth and the fowls shall summer upon them andall the beasts of the earth shall winter upon them in that time shall the present be brought unto the lord of hostsof a people scattered and peeled and from a people terrible fromtheir beginning hitherto a

every one against his brother and every one against hisneighbour city against city and kingdom against kingdom and the spirit of egypt shall fail in the midst thereof and iwill destroy the counsel thereof and they shall seek to the idolsand to the charmers and to them that have familiar spirits and tothe wizards and the egyptians will i give over into the hand of a cruel lordand a fierce king

a perverse spirit in the midst thereofand they have caused egypt to err in every work thereof as a drunkenman staggereth in his vomit neither shall there be any work for egypt which the head ortail branch or rush may do in that day shall egypt be like unto women and it shall beafraid and fear because of the shaking of the hand of the lord ofhosts which he shaketh over it and the land of judah shall be a terror unto egypt every onethat maketh mention thereof shall be afraid in himself because of thecounsel of the lord of hosts which he hath determined against it in that day shall five cities in the land of egypt speak thelanguage of canaan and swear to the lord of hosts one shall becalled the city of destruction in that day shall there be an altar to the lord in the midst ofthe land of egypt and a pillar at the border thereof to the lord and it shall be for a sign and for a witness unto the lord ofhosts in the land of egypt for they shall cry unto the lord becauseof the oppressors and he shall send them a saviour and a great oneand he shall deliver them and the lord shall be known to egypt and the egyptians shallknow the lord in that day and shall do sacrifice and

shall israel be the third with egypt and withassyria even a blessing in the midst of the land  whom the lordof hosts shall bless saying blessed be egypt my people and assyriathe work of my hands and israel mine inheritance in the year that tartan came unto ashdod when sargon the kingof assyria sent him and fought against ashdod and took it  atthe same time spake the lord by isaiah the son of amoz saying go andloose the sackcloth from off thy loins and put off thy shoe from thyfoot and he did so walking naked and barefoot and the lord said like as my servant isaiah hath walked nakedand barefoot three years for a sign and wonder upon egypt and uponethiopia  so shall the king of assyria lead away the egyptiansprisoners and the ethiopians captives young and old naked andbarefoot even with their buttocks uncovered to the shame of egypt and they shall be afraid and ashamed of ethiopia theirexpectation and of egypt their glory and the inhabitant of this isle shall say in that day beholdsuch is our expectation whither we flee for help to be delivered fromthe king of assyria and how shall we escape   the burden of thedesert of the sea as whirlwinds in the south pass through so itcometh from

chambers and shut thydoors about thee hide thyself as it were for a little moment untilthe indignation be overpast for behold the lord cometh out of his place to punish theinhabitants of the earth for their iniquity the earth also shalldisclose her blood and shall no more cover her slain in that day the lord with his sore and great and strong swordshall punish leviathan the piercing serpent even leviathan thatcrooked serpent and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea in that day sing ye unto her a vineyard of red wine i the lord do keep it i will water it every moment lest anyhurt it i will keep it night and day fury is not in me who would set the briers and thorns against mein battle i would go through them i would burn them together or let him take hold of my strength that he may make peace withme and he shall make peace with me he shall cause them that come of jacob to take root israel shallblossom and bud and fill the face of the world with fruit hath he smitten him as he smote those that smote him or is heslain according to the slaughter of them that are slain by him  in measure when it shooteth forth thou wilt debate with it hestayeth his rough wind in the day of the east wind by this therefore shall the iniquity of jacob be purged and thisis all the fruit to take away his sin when he maketh all the stonesof the altar as chalkstones that are beaten in sunder the groves andimages shall not stand up yet the defenced city shall be desolate and the habitationforsaken and left like a wilderness there shall the calf feed andthere shall he lie down and consume the branches thereof when the boughs thereof are withered they shall be broken offthe women come and set them on fire for it is a people of nounderstanding therefore he that made them will not have mercy onthem and he that formed them will shew them no favour and it shall come to pass in that day that the lord shall beatoff from the channel of the river unto the stream of egypt and yeshall be gathered one by one o ye children of israel and it shall come to pass in that day that the great trumpetshall be blown and they shall come which were ready to perish in theland of assyria and the outcasts in the land of egypt and shallworship the lord in the holy mount at jerusalem woe to the crown of pride to the drunkards of ephraim whoseglorious beauty is a fading flower which are on the head of the fatvalleys of them that are overcome with wine   behold the lordhath a mighty and strong one which as a tempest of hail and adestroying storm as a flood of mighty waters overflowing shall castdown to the earth with the hand the crown of pride the drunkards of ephraim shall be troddenunder feet  and the glorious beauty which is on the head of thefat valley shall be a fading flower and as the hasty fruit beforethe summer which when he that looketh upon it seeth while it is yetin his hand he eateth it up in that day shall the lord of hosts be for a crown of glory andfor a diadem of beauty unto the residue of his people  and for aspirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment and for strengthto them that turn the battle to the gate but they also have erred through wine and through strong drinkare out of the way the priest and the prophet have erred throughstrong drink they are swallowed up of wine they are out of the waythrough strong drink they err in vision they stumble in judgment for all tables are full of vomit and filthiness so that there isno place clean whom shall he teach knowledge and whom shall he make tounderstand doctrine them that are weaned from the milk and drawnfrom the breasts for precept must be upon precept precept upon precept lineupon line line upon line here a little and there a little for with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to thispeople to whom he said this is the rest wherewith ye may cause theweary to rest and this is the refreshing yet they would not hear but the word of the lord was unto them precept upon preceptprecept upon precept line upon line line upon line here a littleand there a little that they might go and fall backward and bebroken and snared and taken wherefore hear the word of the lord ye scornful men that rulethis people which is in jerusalem because ye have said we have made a covenant with death andwith hell are we at agreement when the overflowing scourge shall passthrough it shall not come unto us for we have made lies our refugeand under falsehood have we hid ourselves  therefore thus saiththe lord god behold i lay in zion for a foundation a stone a triedstone a precious corner stone a sure foundation he that believethshall not make haste judgment also will i lay to the line and righteousness to theplummet and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies and thewaters shall overflow the hiding place and your covenant with death shall be disannulled and youragreement with hell shall not stand when the overflowing scourgeshall pass through then ye shall be trodden down by it from the time that it goeth forth it shall take you for morningby morning shall it pass over by day and by night and it shall be avexation only to understand the report for the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself onit and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself in it for the lord shall rise up as in mount perazim he shall bewroth as in the valley of gibeon that he may do his work his strangework and bring to pass his act his strange act now therefore be ye not mockers lest your bands be made strongfor i have heard from the lord god of hosts a consumption evendetermined upon the whole earth give ye ear and hear my voice hearken and hear my speech doth the plowman plow all day to sow doth he open and break theclods of his ground   when he hath made plain the face thereofdoth he not cast abroad the fitches and scatter the cummin and castin the principal wheat and the appointed barley and the rie in theirplace   for his god doth instruct him to discretion and dothteach him for the fitches are not threshed with a threshing instrumentneither is a cart wheel turned about upon the cummin but the fitchesare beaten out with a staff and the cummin with a rod bread corn is bruised because he will not ever be threshing itnor break it with the wheel of his cart nor bruise it with hishorsemen this also cometh forth from the lord of hosts which iswonderful in counsel and excellent in working woe to ariel to ariel the city where david dwelt add ye yearto year let them kill sacrifices yet i will distress ariel and there shall be heaviness andsorrow and it shall be unto me as ariel and i will camp against thee round about and will lay siegeagainst thee with a mount and i will raise forts against thee and thou shalt be brought down and shalt speak out of theground and thy speech shall be low out of the dust and thy voiceshall be as of one that hath a familiar spirit out of the groundand thy speech shall whisper out of the dust moreover the multitude of thy strangers shall be like small dustand the multitude of the terrible ones shall be as chaff that passethaway yea it shall be at an instant suddenly thou shalt be visited of the lord of hosts with thunder and withearthquake and great noise with storm and tempest and the flame ofdevouring fire and the multitude of all the nations that fight against arieleven all that fight against her and her munition and that distressher shall be as a dream of a night vision it shall even be as when an hungry man dreameth and behold heeateth but he awaketh and his soul is empty or as when a thirstyman dreameth and behold he drinketh but he awaketh and beholdhe is faint and his soul hath appetite so shall the multitude of allthe nations be that fight against mount zion stay yourselves and wonder cry ye out and cry they aredrunken but not with wine they stagger but not with strong drink for the lord hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleepand hath closed your eyes the prophets and your rulers the seershath he covered and the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a bookthat is sealed which men deliver to one that is learned saying readthis i pray thee and he saith i cannot for it is sealed  andthe book is delivered to him that is not learned saying read this ipray thee and he saith i am not learned wherefore the lord said forasmuch as this people draw near mewith their mouth and with their lips do honour me but have removedtheir heart far from me and their fear toward me is taught by theprecept of men  therefore behold i will proceed to do amarvellous work among this people even a marvellous work and awonder for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish and theunderstanding of their prudent men shall be hid woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from thelord and their works are in the dark and they say who seeth us andwho knoweth us   surely your turning of things upside down shallbe esteemed as the potters clay for shall the work say of him thatmade it he made me not or shall the thing framed say of him thatframed it he had no understanding   is it not yet a very littlewhile and lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field and thefruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest   and in that dayshall the deaf hear the words of the book and the eyes of the blindshall see out of obscurity and out of darkness the meek also shall increase their joy in the lord and the pooramong men shall rejoice in the holy one of israel for the terrible one is brought to nought and the scorner isconsumed and all that watch for iniquity are cut off  that makea man an offender for a word and lay a snare for him that reprovethin the gate and turn aside the just for a thing of nought therefore thus saith the lord who redeemed abraham concerningthe house of jacob jacob shall not now be ashamed neither shall hisface now wax pale but when he seeth his children the work of mine hands in themidst of him they shall sanctify my name and sanctify the holy oneof jacob and shall fear the god of israel they also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding andthey that murmured shall learn doctrine woe to the rebellious children saith the lord that takecounsel but not of me and that cover with a covering but not of myspirit that they may add sin to sin  that walk to go down intoegypt and have not asked at my mouth to strengthen themselves in thestrength of pharaoh and to trust in the shadow of egypt  therefore shall the strength of pharaoh be your shame and the trustin the shadow of egypt your confusion for his princes were at zoan and his ambassadors came to hanes they were all ashamed of a people that could not profit them norbe an help nor profit but a shame and also a reproach the burden of the beasts of the south into the land of troubleand anguish from whence come the young and old lion the viper andfiery flying serpent they will carry their riches upon the shouldersof young asses and their treasures upon the bunches of camels to apeople that shall not profit them for the egyptians shall help in vain and to no purposetherefore have i cried concerning this their strength is to sitstill now go write it before them in a table and note it in a bookthat it may be for the time to come for ever and ever  that thisis a rebellious people lying children children that will not hearthe law of the lord  which say to the seers see not and to theprophets prophesy not unto us right things speak unto us smooththings prophesy deceits  get you out of the way turn aside outof the path cause the holy one of israel to cease from before us wherefore thus saith the holy one of israel because ye despisethis word and trust in oppression and perverseness and stay thereon therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready tofall swelling out in a high wall whose breaking cometh suddenly atan instant and he shall break it as the breaking of the potters vesselthat is broken in pieces he shall not spare so that there shall notbe found in the bursting of it a sherd to take fire from the hearthor to take water withal out of the pit for thus saith the lord god the holy one of israel inreturning and rest shall ye be saved in quietness and in confidenceshall be your strength and ye would not but ye said no for we will flee upon horses therefore shallye flee and we will ride upon the swift therefore shall they thatpursue you be swift one thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one at the rebuke offive shall ye flee till ye be left as a beacon upon the top of amountain and as an ensign on an hill and therefore will the lord wait that he may be gracious untoyou and therefore will he be exalted that he may have mercy uponyou for the lord is a god of judgment blessed are all they that waitfor him for the people shall dwell in zion at jerusalem thou shalt weepno more he will be very gracious unto thee at the voice of thy crywhen he shall hear it he will answer thee and though the lord give you the bread of adversity and thewater of affliction yet shall not thy teachers be removed into acorner any more but thine eyes shall see thy teachers  andthine ears shall hear a word behind thee saying this is the waywalk ye in it when ye turn to the right hand and when ye turn to theleft ye shall defile also the covering of thy graven images ofsilver and the ornament of thy molten images of gold thou shalt castthem away as a menstruous cloth thou shalt say unto it get theehence then shall he give the rain of thy seed that thou shalt sow theground withal and bread of the increase of the earth and it shall befat and plenteous in that day shall thy cattle feed in largepastures the oxen likewise and the young asses that ear the ground shalleat clean provender which hath been winnowed with the shovel and withthe fan and there shall be upon every high mountain and upon every highhill rivers and streams of waters in the day of the great slaughterwhen the towers fall moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sunand the light of the sun shall be sevenfold as the light of sevendays in the day that the lord bindeth up the breach of his peopleand healeth the stroke of their wound behold the name of the lord cometh from far burning with hisanger and the burden thereof is heavy his lips are full ofindignation and his tongue as a devouring fire  and his breathas an overflowing stream shall reach to the midst of the neck tosift the nations with the sieve of vanity and there shall be a bridlein the jaws of the people causing them to err ye shall have a song as in the night when a holy solemnity iskept and gladness of heart as when one goeth with a pipe to comeinto the mountain of the lord to the mighty one of israel and the lord shall cause his glorious voice to be heard andshall shew the lighting down of his arm with the indignation of hisanger and with the flame of a devouring fire with scattering andtempest and hailstones for through the voice of the lord shall the assyrian be beatendown which smote with a rod and in every place where the grounded staff shall pass whichthe lord shall lay upon him it shall be with tabrets and harps andin battles of shaking will he fight with it for tophet is ordained of old yea for the king it is preparedhe hath made it deep and large the pile thereof is fire and muchwood the breath of the lord like a stream of brimstone doth kindleit woe to them that go down to egypt for help and stay on horsesand trust in chariots because they are many and in horsemen becausethey are very strong but they look not unto the holy one of israelneither seek the lord   yet he also is wise and will bring eviland will not call back his words but will arise against the house ofthe evildoers and against the help of them that work iniquity now the egyptians are men and not god and their horses fleshand not spirit when the lord shall stretch out his hand both he thathelpeth shall fall and he that is holpen shall fall down and theyall shall fail together for thus hath the lord spoken unto me like as the lion and theyoung lion roaring on his prey when a multitude of shepherds iscalled forth against him he will not be afraid of their voice norabase himself for the noise of them so shall the lord of hosts comedown to fight for mount zion and for the hill thereof as birds flying so will the lord of hosts defend jerusalemdefending also he will deliver it and passing over he will preserveit turn ye unto him from whom the children of israel have deeplyrevolted for in that day every man shall cast away his idols of silverand his idols of gold which your own hands have made unto you for asin then shall the assyrian fall with the sword not of a mighty manand the sword not of a mean man shall devour him but he shall fleefrom the sword and his young men shall be discomfited and he shall pass over to his strong hold for fear and hisprinces shall be afraid of the ensign saith the lord whose fire isin zion and his furnace in jerusalem behold a king shall reign in righteousness and princes shallrule in judgment and a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind and a covertfrom the tempest as rivers of water in a dry place as the shadow ofa great rock in a weary land and the eyes of them that see shall not be dim and the ears ofthem that hear shall hearken the heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge and thetongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly the vile person shall be no more called liberal nor the churlsaid to be bountiful for the vile person will speak villany and his heart will workiniquity to practise hypocrisy and to utter error against the lordto make empty the soul of the hungry and he will cause the drink ofthe thirsty to fail the instruments also of the churl are evil he deviseth wickeddevices to destroy the poor with lying words even when the needyspeaketh right but the liberal deviseth liberal things and by liberal thingsshall he stand rise up ye women that are at ease hear my voice ye carelessdaughters give ear unto my speech many days and years shall ye be troubled ye careless women forthe vintage shall fail the gathering shall not come tremble ye women that are at ease be troubled ye carelessones strip you and make you bare and gird sackcloth upon yourloins they shall lament for the teats for the pleasant fields forthe fruitful vine upon the land of my people shall come up thorns and briers yeaupon all the houses of joy in the joyous city  because thepalaces shall be forsaken the multitude of the city shall be leftthe forts and towers shall be for dens for ever a joy of wild assesa pasture of flocks  until the spirit be poured upon us from onhigh and the wilderness be a fruitful field

ofrighteousness quietness and assurance for ever and my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation and in suredwellings and in quiet resting places  when it shall hailcoming down on the forest and the city shall be low in a low place blessed are ye that sow beside all waters that send forththither the feet of the ox and the ass woe to thee that spoilest and thou wast not spoiled and

away now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king hezekiah thatsennacherib king of assyria came up against all the defenced cities ofjudah and took them and the king of assyria sent rabshakeh from lachish to jerusalemunto king hezekiah with a great army and he stood by the conduit ofthe upper pool in the highway of the fullers field then came forth unto him eliakim hilkiahs son which was overthe house and shebna the scribe and joah asaphs son the recorder and rabshakeh said unto them say ye now to hezekiah thus saiththe great king the king of assyria what confidence is this whereinthou trustest   i say sayest thou but they are but vain wordsi have counsel and strength for war now on whom dost thou trust thatthou rebellest against me   lo thou trustest in the staff ofthis broken reed on egypt whereon if a man lean it will go into hishand and pierce it so is pharaoh king of egypt to all that trust inhim but if thou say to me we trust in the lord our god is it nothe whose high places and whose altars hezekiah hath taken away andsaid to judah and to jerusalem ye shall worship before this altar now therefore give pledges i pray thee to my master the king ofassyria and i will give thee two thousand horses if thou be able onthy part to set riders upon them how then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the leastof my masters servants and put thy trust on egypt for chariots andfor horsemen   and am i now come up without the lord againstthis land to destroy it the lord said unto me go up against thisland and destroy it then said eliakim and shebna and joah unto rabshakeh speak ipray thee unto thy servants in the syrian language for we understandit and speak not to us in the jews language in the ears of thepeople that are on the wall but rabshakeh said hath my master sent me to thy master and tothee to speak these words hath he not sent me to the men that situpon the wall that they may eat their own dung and drink their ownpiss with you   then rabshakeh stood and cried with a loudvoice in the jews language and said hear ye the words of the greatking the king of assyria thus saith the king let not hezekiah deceive you for he shallnot be able to deliver you neither let hezekiah make you trust in the lord saying thelord will surely deliver us this city shall not be delivered into thehand of the king of assyria hearken not to hezekiah for thus saith the king of assyriamake an agreement with me by a present and come out to me and eat yeevery one of his vine and every one of his fig tree and drink yeevery one the waters of his own cistern  until i come and takeyou away to a land like your own land a land of corn and wine a landof bread and vineyards beware lest hezekiah persuade you saying the lord will deliverushath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the handof the king of assyria   where are the gods of hamath andarphad where are the gods of sepharvaim and have they deliveredsamaria out of my hand   who are they among all the gods ofthese lands that have delivered their land out of my hand that thelord should deliver jerusalem out of my hand   but they heldtheir peace and answered him not a word for the kings commandmentwas saying answer him not then came eliakim the son of hilkiah that was over thehousehold and shebna the scribe and joah the son of asaph therecorder to hezekiah with their clothes rent and told him the wordsof rabshakeh and it came to pass when king hezekiah heard it that he renthis clothes and covered himself with sackcloth and went into thehouse of the lord and he sent eliakim who was over the household and shebna thescribe and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth untoisaiah the prophet the son of amoz and they said unto him thus saith hezekiah this day is a day oftrouble and of rebuke and of blasphemy for the children are come tothe birth and there is not strength to bring forth it may be the lord thy god will hear the words of rabshakeh whomthe king of assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living godand will reprove the words which the lord thy god hath heardwherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that is left so the servants of king hezekiah came to isaiah and isaiah said unto them thus shall ye say unto your masterthus saith the lord be not afraid of the words that thou hast heardwherewith the servants of the king of assyria have blasphemed me behold i will send a blast upon him and he shall hear a rumourand return to his own land and i will cause him to fall by the swordin his own land so rabshakeh returned and found the king of assyria warringagainst libnah for he had heard that he was departed from lachish and he heard say concerning tirhakah king of ethiopia he is comeforth to make war with thee and when he heard it he sent messengersto hezekiah saying  thus shall ye speak to hezekiah king ofjudah saying let not thy god in whom thou trustest deceive theesaying jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king ofassyria behold thou hast heard what the kings of assyria have done toall lands by destroying them utterly and shalt thou be delivered have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathershave destroyed as gozan and haran and rezeph and the children ofeden which were in telassar   where is the king of hamath andthe king of arphad and the king of the city of sepharvaim hena andivah   and hezekiah received the letter from the hand of themessengers and read it and hezekiah went up unto the house of thelord and spread it before the lord and hezekiah prayed unto the lord saying  o lord ofhosts god of israel that dwellest between the cherubims thou artthe god even thou alone of all the kingdoms of the earth thou hastmade heaven and earth incline thine ear o lord and hear open thine eyes o lordand see and hear all the words of sennacherib which hath sent toreproach the living god of a truth lord the kings of assyria have laid waste all thenations and their countries  and have cast their gods into thefire for they were no gods but the work of mens hands wood andstone therefore they have destroyed them now therefore o lord our god save us from his hand that allthe kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the lord even thouonly then isaiah the son of amoz sent unto hezekiah saying thussaith the lord god of israel whereas thou hast prayed to me againstsennacherib king of assyria  this is the word which the lordhath spoken concerning him the virgin the daughter of zion hathdespised thee and laughed thee to scorn the daughter of jerusalemhath shaken her head at thee whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed and against whom hastthou exalted thy voice and lifted up thine eyes on high even againstthe holy one of israel by thy servants hast thou reproached the lord and hast said bythe multitude of my chariots am i come up to the height of themountains to the sides of lebanon and i will cut down the tallcedars thereof and the choice fir trees thereof and i will enterinto the height of his border and the forest of his carmel i have digged and drunk water and with the sole of my feethave i dried up all the rivers of the besieged places hast thou not heard long ago how i have done it and of ancienttimes that i have formed it now have i brought it to pass that thoushouldest be to lay waste defenced cities into ruinous heaps therefore their inhabitants were of small power they weredismayed and confounded they were as the grass of the field and asthe green herb as the grass on the housetops and as corn blastedbefore it be grown up but i know thy abode and thy going out and thy coming in andthy rage against me because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up intomine ears therefore will i put my hook in thy nose and my bridle inthy lips and i will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest and this shall be a sign unto thee ye shall eat this year suchas groweth of itself and the second year that which springeth of thesame and in the third year sow ye and reap and plant vineyards andeat the fruit thereof and the remnant that is escaped of the house of judah shallagain take root downward and bear fruit upward  for out ofjerusalem shall go forth a remnant and they that escape out of mountzion the zeal of the lord of hosts shall do this therefore thus saith the lord concerning the king of assyria heshall not come into this city nor shoot an arrow there nor comebefore it with shields nor cast a bank against it by the way that he came by the same shall he return and shallnot come into this city saith the lord for i will defend this city to save it for mine own sake andfor my servant davids sake then the angel of the lord went forth and smote in the camp ofthe assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand and when theyarose early in the morning behold they were all dead corpses so sennacherib king of assyria departed and went and returnedand dwelt at nineveh and it came to pass as he was worshipping in the house ofnisroch his god that adrammelech and sharezer his sons smote him withthe sword and they escaped into the land of armenia and esarhaddonhis son reigned in his stead in those days was hezekiah sick unto death and isaiah theprophet the son of amoz came unto him and said unto him thus saiththe lord set thine house in order for thou shalt die and not live then hezekiah turned his face toward the wall and prayed untothe lord  and said remember now o lord i beseech thee how ihave walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart and havedone that which is good in thy sight and hezekiah wept sore then came the word of the lord to isaiah saying  go andsay to hezekiah thus saith the lord the god of david thy father ihave heard thy prayer i have seen thy tears behold i will add untothy days fifteen years and i will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the kingof assyria and i will defend this city and this shall be a sign unto thee from the lord that the lordwill do this thing that he hath spoken  behold i will bringagain the shadow of the degrees which is gone down in the sun dial ofahaz ten degrees backward so the sun returned ten degrees by whichdegrees it was gone down the writing of hezekiah king of judah when he had been sick andwas recovered of his sickness  i said in the cutting off of mydays i shall go to the gates of the grave i am deprived of theresidue of my years i said i shall not see the lord even the lord in the land ofthe living i shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of theworld mine age is departed and is removed from me as a shepherdstent i have cut off like a weaver my life he will cut me off withpining sickness from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me i reckoned till morning that as a lion so will he break allmy bones from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me like a crane or a swallow so did i chatter i did mourn as adove mine eyes fail with looking upward o lord i am oppressedundertake for me what shall i say he hath both spoken unto me and himself hathdone it i shall go softly all my years in the bitterness of my soul o lord by these things men live and in all these things is thelife of my spirit so wilt thou recover me and make me to live behold for peace i had great bitterness but thou hast in loveto my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption for thou hast castall my sins behind thy back for the grave cannot praise thee death can not celebrate theethey that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth the living the living he shall praise thee as i do this daythe father to the children shall make known thy truth the lord was ready to save me therefore we will sing my songsto the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house ofthe lord for isaiah had said let them take a lump of figs and lay itfor a plaister upon the boil and he shall recover hezekiah also had said what is the sign that i shall go up tothe house of the lord   at that time merodachbaladan the son ofbaladan king of babylon sent letters and a present to hezekiah forhe had heard that he had been sick and was recovered and hezekiah was glad of them and shewed them the house of hisprecious things the silver and the gold and the spices and theprecious ointment and all the house of his armour and all that wasfound in his treasures there was nothing in his house nor in all hisdominion that hezekiah shewed them not then came isaiah the prophet unto king hezekiah and said untohim what said these men and from whence came they unto thee andhezekiah said they are come from a far country unto me even frombabylon then said he what have they seen in thine house and hezekiahanswered all that is in mine house have they seen there is nothingamong my treasures that i have not shewed them then said isaiah to hezekiah hear the word of the lord of hosts behold the days come that all that is in thine house and thatwhich thy fathers have laid up in store until this day shall becarried to babylon nothing shall be left saith the lord and of thy sons that shall issue from thee which thou shaltbeget shall they take away and they shall be eunuchs in the palaceof the king of babylon then said hezekiah to isaiah good is the word of the lord whichthou hast spoken he said moreover for there shall be peace and truthin my days comfort ye comfort ye my people saith your god speak ye comfortably to jerusalem and cry unto her that herwarfare is accomplished that her iniquity is pardoned for she hathreceived of the lords hand double for all her sins the voice of him that crieth in the wilderness prepare ye theway of the lord make straight in the desert a highway for our god every valley shall be exalted and every mountain and hill shallbe made low and the crooked shall be made straight and the roughplaces plain  and the glory of the lord shall be revealed andall flesh shall see it together for the mouth of the lord hath spokenit the voice said cry and he said what shall i cry all flesh isgrass and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field the grass withereth the flower fadeth because the spirit of thelord bloweth upon it surely the people is grass the grass withereth the flower fadeth but the word of our godshall stand for ever o zion that bringest good tidings get thee up into the highmountain o jerusalem that bringest good tidings lift up thy voicewith strength lift it up be not afraid say unto the cities ofjudah behold your god   behold the lord god will come withstrong hand and his arm shall rule for him behold his reward iswith him and his work before him he shall feed his flock like a shepherd he shall gather thelambs with his arm and carry them in his bosom and shall gently leadthose that are with young who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand andmeted out heaven with the span and comprehended the dust of the earthin a measure and weighed the mountains in scales and the hills in abalance   who hath directed the spirit of the lord or being hiscounsellor hath taught him   with whom took he counsel and whoinstructed him and taught him in the path of judgment and taught

me shall possess the land and shall inherit my holymountain  and shall say cast ye up cast ye up prepare theway take up the stumblingblock out of the way of my people for thus saith the high and lofty one that inhabiteth eternitywhose name is holy i dwell in the high and holy place with him alsothat is of a contrite and humble spirit to revive the spirit of thehumble and to revive the heart of the contrite ones for i will not contend for ever neither will i be always wrothfor the spirit should fail before me and the souls which i have made for the iniquity of his covetousness was i wroth and smote himi hid me and was wroth and he went on frowardly in the way of hisheart i have seen his ways and will heal him i will lead him alsoand restore comforts unto him and to his mourners i create the fruit of the lips peace peace to him that is faroff and to him that is near saith the lord and i will heal him but the wicked are like the troubled sea when it cannot restwhose waters cast up mire and dirt there is no peace saith my god to the wicked cry aloud spare not lift up thy voice like a trumpet and shewmy people their transgression and the house of jacob their sins yet they seek me daily and delight to know my ways as a nationthat did righteousness and forsook not the ordinance of their godthey ask of me the ordinances of justice they take delight inapproaching to god wherefore have we fasted say they and thou seest not whereforehave we afflicted our soul and thou takest no knowledge behold inthe day of your fast ye find pleasure and exact all your labours behold ye fast for strife and debate and to smite with the fistof wickedness ye shall not fast as ye do this day to make your voiceto be heard on high is it such a fast that i have chosen a day for a man to afflicthis soul is it to bow down his head as a bulrush and to spreadsackcloth and ashes under him wilt thou call this a fast and anacceptable day to the lord   is not this the fast that i havechosen to loose the bands of wickedness to undo the heavy burdensand to let the oppressed go free and that ye break every yoke  is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry and that thou bring thepoor that are cast out to thy house when thou seest the naked thatthou cover him and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh then shall thy light break forth as the morning and thine healthshall spring forth speedily and thy righteousness shall go beforethee the glory of the lord shall be thy rereward then shalt thou call and the lord shall answer thou shalt cryand he shall say here i am if thou take away from the midst of theethe yoke the putting forth of the finger and speaking vanity and if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry and satisfy the afflictedsoul then shall thy light rise in obscurity and thy darkness be asthe noon day  and the lord shall guide thee continually andsatisfy thy soul in drought and make fat thy bones and thou shalt belike a watered garden and like a spring of water whose waters failnot and they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste placesthou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations and thoushalt be called the repairer of the breach the restorer of paths todwell in if thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath from doing thypleasure on my holy day and call the sabbath a delight the holy ofthe lord honourable and shalt honour him not doing thine own waysnor finding thine own pleasure nor speaking thine own words then shalt thou delight thyself in the lord and i will cause thee toride upon the high places of the earth and feed thee with theheritage of jacob thy father for the mouth of the lord hath spokenit behold the lords hand is not shortened that it cannot saveneither his ear heavy that it cannot hear  but your iniquitieshave separated between you and your god and your sins have hid hisface from you that he will not hear for your hands are defiled with blood and your fingers withiniquity your lips have spoken lies your tongue hath mutteredperverseness none calleth for justice nor any pleadeth for truth they trustin vanity and speak lies they conceive mischief and bring forthiniquity they hatch cockatrice eggs and weave the spiders web he thateateth of their eggs dieth and that which is crushed breaketh outinto a viper their webs shall not become garments neither shall they coverthemselves with their works their works are works of iniquity andthe act of violence is in their hands their feet run to evil and they make haste to shed innocentblood their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity wasting anddestruction are in their paths the way of peace they know not and there is no judgment in theirgoings they have made them crooked paths whosoever goeth thereinshall not know peace therefore is judgment far from us neither doth justice overtakeus we wait for light but behold obscurity for brightness but wewalk in darkness we grope for the wall like the blind and we grope as if we hadno eyes we stumble at noon day as in the night we are in desolateplaces as dead men we roar all like bears and mourn sore like doves we look forjudgment but there is none for salvation but it is far off from us for our transgressions are multiplied before thee and our sinstestify against us for our transgressions are with us and as for ouriniquities we know them  in transgressing and lying against thelord and departing away from our god speaking oppression and revoltconceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood and judgment is turned away backward and justice standeth afaroff for truth is fallen in the street and equity cannot enter yea truth faileth and he that departeth from evil makethhimself a prey and the lord saw it and it displeased him that therewas no judgment and he saw that there was no man and wondered that there was nointercessor therefore his arm brought salvation unto him and hisrighteousness it sustained him for he put on righteousness as a breastplate and an helmet ofsalvation upon his head and he put on the garments of vengeance forclothing and was clad with zeal as a cloak according to their deeds accordingly he will repay fury to hisadversaries recompence to his enemies to the islands he will repayrecompence so shall they fear the name of the lord from the west and hisglory from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like aflood the spirit of the lord shall lift up a standard against him and the redeemer shall come to zion and unto them that turnfrom transgression in jacob saith the lord as for me this is my covenant with them saith the lord myspirit that is upon thee and my words which i have put in thy mouthshall not depart out of thy mouth nor out of the mouth of thy seednor out of the mouth of thy seeds seed saith the lord fromhenceforth and for ever arise shine for thy light is come and the glory of the lord isrisen upon thee for behold the darkness shall cover the earth and grossdarkness the people but the lord shall arise upon thee and his gloryshall be seen upon thee and the gentiles shall come to thy light and kings to thebrightness of thy rising lift up thine eyes round about and see all they gatherthemselves together they come to thee thy sons shall come from farand thy daughters shall be nursed at thy side then thou shalt see and flow together and thine heart shallfear and be enlarged because the abundance of the sea shall beconverted unto thee the forces of the gentiles shall come unto thee the multitude of camels shall cover thee the dromedaries ofmidian and ephah all they from sheba shall come they shall bringgold and incense and they shall shew forth the praises of the lord all the flocks of kedar shall be gathered together unto thee therams of nebaioth shall minister unto thee they shall come up withacceptance on mine altar and i will glorify the house of my glory who are these that fly as a cloud and as the doves to theirwindows   surely the isles shall wait for me and the ships oftarshish first to bring thy sons from far their silver and theirgold with them unto the name of the lord thy god and to the holy oneof israel because he hath glorified thee and the sons of strangers shall build up thy walls and theirkings shall minister unto thee for in my wrath i smote thee but inmy favour have i had mercy on thee therefore thy gates shall be open continually they

call them the holy people the redeemed of thelord and thou shalt be called sought out a city not forsaken who is this that cometh from edom with dyed garments frombozrah  this that is glorious in his apparel travelling in thegreatness of his strength i that speak in righteousness mighty tosave wherefore art thou red in thine apparel and thy garments likehim that treadeth in the winefat   i have trodden the winepressalone and of the people there was none with me for i will tread themin mine anger and trample them in my fury and their blood shall besprinkled upon my garments and i will stain all my raiment for the day of vengeance is in mine heart and the year of myredeemed is come and i looked and there was none to help and i wondered thatthere was none to uphold therefore mine own arm brought salvationunto me and my fury it upheld me and i will tread down the people in mine anger and make themdrunk in my fury and i will bring down their strength to the earth i will mention the lovingkindnesses of the lord and the praisesof the lord according to all that the lord hath bestowed on us andthe great goodness toward the house of israel which he hath bestowedon them according to his mercies and according to the multitude ofhis lovingkindnesses for he said surely they are my people children that will notlie so he was their saviour in all their affliction he was afflicted and the angel of hispresence saved them in his love and in his pity he redeemed them andhe bare them and carried them all the days of old but they rebelled and vexed his holy spirit therefore he wasturned to be their enemy and he fought against them then he remembered the days of old moses and his peoplesaying where is he that brought them up out of the sea with theshepherd of his flock where is he that put his holy spirit withinhim   that led them by the right hand of moses with his gloriousarm dividing the water before them to make himself an everlastingname   that led them through the deep as an horse in thewilderness that they should not stumble   as a beast goeth downinto the valley the spirit of the lord caused him to rest so didstthou lead thy people to make thyself a glorious name look down from heaven and behold from the habitation of thyholiness and of thy glory where is thy zeal and thy strength thesounding of thy bowels and of thy mercies toward me are theyrestrained   doubtless thou art our father though abraham beignorant of us and israel acknowledge us not thou o lord art ourfather our redeemer thy name is from everlasting o lord why hast thou made us to err from thy ways and hardenedour heart from thy fear return for thy servants sake the tribes ofthine inheritance the people of thy holiness have possessed it but a little whileour adversaries have trodden down thy sanctuary we are thine thou never barest rule over them they were notcalled by thy name oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens that thou wouldest comedown that the mountains might flow down at thy presence  as whenthe melting fire burneth the fire causeth the waters to boil to makethy name known to thine adversaries that the nations may tremble atthy presence   when thou didst terrible things which we lookednot for thou camest down the mountains flowed down at thy presence for since the beginning of the world men have not heard norperceived by the ear neither hath the eye seen o god beside theewhat he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness thosethat remember thee in thy ways behold thou art wroth for we havesinned in those is continuance and we shall be saved but we are all as an unclean thing and all our righteousnessesare as filthy rags and we all do fade as a leaf and our iniquitieslike the wind have taken us away and there is none that calleth upon thy name that stirreth uphimself to take hold of thee for thou hast hid thy face from us andhast consumed us because of our iniquities but now o lord thou art our father we are the clay and thouour potter and we all are the work of thy hand be not wroth very sore o lord neither remember iniquity forever behold see we beseech thee we are all thy people thy holy cities are a wilderness zion is a wildernessjerusalem a desolation our holy and our beautiful house where our fathers praisedthee is burned up with fire and all our pleasant things are laidwaste wilt thou refrain thyself for these things o lord wilt thouhold thy peace and afflict us very sore   i am sought of themthat asked not for me i am found of them that sought me not i saidbehold me behold me unto a nation that was not called by my name i have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious peoplewhich walketh in a way that was not good after their own thoughts a people that provoketh me to anger continually to my face thatsacrificeth in gardens and burneth incense upon altars of brick which remain among the graves and lodge in the monuments which eatswines flesh and broth of abominable things is in their vessels which say stand by thyself come not near to me for i am holierthan thou these are a smoke in my nose a fire that burneth all theday behold it is written before me i will not keep silence butwill recompense even recompense into their bosom  youriniquities and the iniquities of your fathers together saith thelord which have burned incense upon the mountains and blasphemed meupon the hills therefore will i measure their former work into theirbosom thus saith the lord as the new wine is found in the cluster andone saith destroy it not for a blessing is in it so will i do formy servants sakes that i may not destroy them all and i will bring forth a seed out of jacob and out of judah aninheritor of my mountains and mine elect shall inherit it and myservants shall dwell there and sharon shall be a fold of flocks and the valley of achor aplace for the herds to lie down in for my people that have sought me but ye are they that forsake the lord that forget my holymountain that prepare a table for that troop and that furnish thedrink offering unto that number therefore will i number you to the sword and ye shall all bowdown to the slaughter because when i called ye did not answer wheni spake ye did not hear but did evil before mine eyes and didchoose that wherein i delighted not therefore thus saith the lord god behold my servants shalleat but ye shall be hungry behold my servants shall drink but yeshall be thirsty behold my servants shall rejoice but ye shall beashamed  behold my servants shall sing for joy of heart but yeshall cry for sorrow of heart and shall howl for vexation of spirit and ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen for thelord god shall slay thee and call his servants by another name that he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in thegod of truth and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the godof truth because the former troubles are forgotten and because theyare hid from mine eyes for behold i create new heavens and a new earth and theformer shall not be remembered nor come into mind but be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which i create forbehold i create jerusalem a rejoicing and her people a joy and i will rejoice in jerusalem and joy in my people and thevoice of weeping shall be no more heard in her nor the voice ofcrying there shall be no more thence an infant of days nor an old manthat hath not filled his days for the child shall die an hundredyears old but the sinner being an hundred years old shall beaccursed and they shall build houses and inhabit them and they shallplant vineyards and eat the fruit of them they shall not build and another inhabit they shall not plantand another eat for as the days of a tree are the days of my peopleand mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands they shall not labour in vain nor bring forth for trouble forthey are the seed of the blessed of the lord and their offspring withthem and it shall come to pass that before they call i will answerand while they are yet speaking i will hear the wolf and the lamb shall feed together and the lion shalleat straw like the bullock and dust shall be the serpents meat theyshall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain saith the lord thus saith the lord the heaven is my throne and the earth is myfootstool where is the house that ye build unto me and where is theplace of my rest   for all those things hath mine hand made andall those things have been saith the lord but to this man will ilook even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit and tremblethat my word he that killeth an ox is as if he slew a man he that sacrificetha lamb as if he cut off a dogs neck he that offereth an oblationas if he offered swines blood he that burneth incense as if heblessed an idolyea they have chosen their own ways and their soul delighteth intheir abominations i also will choose their delusions and will bring their fearsupon them because when i called none did answer when i spake theydid not hear but they did evil before mine eyes and chose that inwhich i delighted not hear the word of the lord ye that tremble at his word yourbrethren that hated you that cast you out for my names sake saidlet the lord be glorified but he shall appear to your joy and theyshall be ashamed a voice of noise from the city a voice from the temple a voiceof the lord that rendereth recompence to his enemies before she travailed she brought forth before her pain cameshe was delivered of a man child who hath heard such a thing who hath seen such things shall theearth be made to bring forth in one day or shall a nation be born atonce  for as soon as zion travailed she brought forth her children shall i bring to the birth and not cause to bring forth saiththe lord shall i cause to bring forth and shut the womb saith thygod rejoice ye with jerusalem and be glad with her all ye thatlove her rejoice for joy with her all ye that mourn for her that ye may suck and be satisfied with the breasts of herconsolations that ye may milk out and be delighted with theabundance of her glory for thus saith the lord behold i will extend peace to her likea river and the glory of the gentiles like a flowing stream thenshall ye suck ye shall be borne upon her sides and be dandled uponher knees as one whom his mother comforteth so will i comfort you and yeshall be comforted in jerusalem and when ye see this your heart shall rejoice and your bonesshall flourish like an herb and the hand of the lord shall be knowntoward his servants and his indignation toward his enemies for behold the lord will come with fire and with his chariotslike a whirlwind to render his anger with fury and his rebuke withflames of fire for by fire and by his sword will the lord plead with all fleshand the slain of the lord shall be many they that sanctify themselves and purify themselves in thegardens behind one tree in the midst eating swines flesh and theabomination and the mouse shall be consumed together saith thelord for i know their works and their thoughts it shall come that iwill gather all nations and tongues and they shall come and see myglory and i will set a sign among them and i will send those thatescape of them unto the nations to tarshish pul and lud that drawthe bow to tubal and javan to the isles afar off that have notheard my fame neither have seen my glory and they shall declare myglory among the gentiles and they shall bring all your brethren for an offering unto thelord out of all nations upon horses and in chariots and in littersand upon mules and upon swift beasts to my holy mountain jerusalemsaith the lord as the children of israel bring an offering in a cleanvessel into the house of the lord and i will also take of them for priests and for levites saiththe lord for as the new heavens and the new earth which i will makeshall remain before me saith the lord so shall your seed and yourname remain and it shall come to pass that from one new moon to anotherand from one sabbath to another shall all flesh come to worshipbefore me saith the lord and they shall go forth and look upon the carcases of the menthat have transgressed against me for their worm shall not dieneither shall their fire be quenched and they shall be an abhorringunto all fleshthe book of the prophet jeremiah the words of jeremiah the son of hilkiah of the priests thatwere in anathoth in the land of benjamin  to whom the word of thelord came in the days of josiah the son of amon king of judah in thethirteenth year of his reign it came also in the days of jehoiakim the son of josiah king ofjudah unto the end of the eleventh year of zedekiah the son of josiahking of judah unto the carrying away of jerusalem captive in thefifth month then the word of the lord came unto me saying  before iformed thee in the belly i knew thee and before thou camest forth outof the womb i sanctified thee and i ordained thee a prophet unto thenations then said i ah lord god behold i cannot speak for i am achild but the lord said unto me say not i am a child for thou shaltgo to all that i shall send thee and whatsoever i command thee thoushalt speak be not afraid of their faces for i am with thee to deliver theesaith the lord then the lord put forth his hand and touched my mouth and thelord said unto me behold i have put my words in thy mouth see i have this day set thee over the nations and over thekingdoms to root out and to pull down and to destroy and to throwdown to build and to plant moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying jeremiahwhat seest thou and i said i see a rod of an almond tree then said the lord unto me thou hast well seen for i willhasten my word to perform it and the word of the lord came unto me the second time sayingwhat seest thou and i said i see a seething pot and the facethereof is toward the north then the lord said unto me out of the north an evil shall breakforth upon all the inhabitants of the land for lo i will call all the families of the kingdoms of thenorth saith the lord and they shall come and they shall set everyone his throne at the entering of the gates of jerusalem and againstall the walls thereof round about and against all the cities ofjudah and i will utter my judgments against them touching all theirwickedness who have forsaken me and have burned incense unto othergods and worshipped the works of their own hands thou therefore gird up thy loins and arise and speak unto themall that i command thee be not dismayed at their faces lest iconfound thee before them for behold i have made thee this day a defenced city and aniron pillar and brasen walls against the whole land against thekings of judah against the princes thereof against the prieststhereof and against the people of the land and they shall fight against thee but they shall not prevailagainst thee for i am with thee saith the lord to deliver thee moreover the word of the lord came to me saying  go and cryin the ears of jerusalem saying thus saith the lord i rememberthee the kindness of thy youth the love of thine espousals whenthou wentest after me in the wilderness in a land that was not sown israel was holiness unto the lord and the firstfruits of hisincrease all that devour him shall offend evil shall come upon themsaith the lord hear ye the word of the lord o house of jacob and all thefamilies of the house of israel  thus saith the lord whatiniquity have your fathers found in me that they are gone far fromme and have walked after vanity and are become vain   neithersaid they where is the lord that brought us up out of the land ofegypt that led us through the wilderness through a land of desertsand of pits through a land of drought and of the shadow of deaththrough a land that no man passed through and where no man dwelt and i brought you into a plentiful country to eat the fruitthereof and the goodness thereof but when ye entered ye defiled myland and made mine heritage an abomination the priests said not where is the lord and they that handle thelaw knew me not the pastors also transgressed against me and theprophets prophesied by baal and walked after things that do notprofit wherefore i will yet plead with you saith the lord and with yourchildrens children will i plead for pass over the isles of chittim and see and send unto kedarand consider diligently and see if there be such a thing hath a nation changed their gods which are yet no gods but mypeople have changed their glory for that which doth not profit be astonished o ye heavens at this and be horribly afraid beye very desolate saith the lord for my people have committed two evils they have forsaken me thefountain of living waters and hewed them out cisterns brokencisterns that can hold no water is israel a servant is he a homeborn slave why is he spoiled the young lions roared upon him and yelled and they made hisland waste his cities are burned without inhabitant also the children of noph and tahapanes have broken the crown ofthy head hast thou not procured this unto thyself in that thou hastforsaken the lord thy god when he led thee by the way   and nowwhat hast thou to do in the way of egypt to drink the waters ofsihor or what hast thou to do in the way of assyria to drink thewaters of the river   thine own wickedness shall correct theeand thy backslidings shall reprove thee know therefore and see thatit is an evil thing and bitter that thou hast forsaken the lord thygod and that my fear is not in thee saith the lord god of hosts for of old time i have broken thy yoke and burst thy bands andthou saidst i will not transgress when upon every high hill andunder every green tree thou wanderest playing the harlot yet i had planted thee a noble vine wholly a right seed howthen art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine untome   for though thou wash thee with nitre and take thee muchsoap yet thine iniquity is marked before me saith the lord god how canst thou say i am not polluted i have not gone afterbaalim  see thy way in the valley know what thou hast done thou arta swift dromedary traversing her ways  a wild ass used to thewilderness that snuffeth up the wind at her pleasure in her occasionwho can turn her away all they that seek her will not wearythemselves in her month they shall find her withhold thy foot from being unshod and thy throat from thirstbut thou saidst there is no hope no for i have loved strangers andafter them will i go as the thief is ashamed when he is found so is the house ofisrael ashamed they their kings their princes and their priestsand their prophets saying to a stock thou art my father and to a stone thou hastbrought me forth for they have turned their back unto me and nottheir face but in the time of their trouble they will say arise andsave us but where are thy gods that thou hast made thee let them ariseif they can save thee in the time of thy trouble for according to thenumber of thy cities are thy gods o judah wherefore will ye plead with me ye all have transgressed againstme saith the lord in vain have i smitten your children they received nocorrection your own sword hath devoured your prophets like adestroying lion o generation see ye the word of the lord have i been awilderness unto israel a land of darkness wherefore say my peoplewe are lords we will come no more unto thee   can a maid forgether ornaments or a bride her attire yet my people have forgotten medays without number why trimmest thou thy way to seek love therefore hast thou alsotaught the wicked ones thy ways also in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poorinnocents i have not found it by secret search but upon all these yet thou sayest because i am innocent surely his anger shallturn from me behold i will plead with thee because thou sayest ihave not sinned why gaddest thou about so much to change thy way thou also shaltbe ashamed of egypt as thou wast ashamed of assyria yea thou shalt go forth from him and thine hands upon thinehead for the lord hath rejected thy confidences and thou shalt notprosper in them they say if a man put away his wife and she go from him andbecome another mans shall he return unto her again shall not thatland be greatly polluted but thou hast played the harlot with manylovers yet return again to me saith the lord lift up thine eyes unto the high places and see where thou hastnot been lien with in the ways hast thou sat for them as the arabianin the wilderness and thou hast polluted the land with thy whoredomsand with thy wickedness therefore the showers have been withholden and there hath been nolatter rain and thou hadst a whores forehead thou refusedst to beashamed wilt thou not from this time cry unto me my father thou art theguide of my youth   will he reserve his anger for ever will hekeep it to the end  behold thou hast spoken and done evil things asthou couldest the lord said also unto me in the days of josiah the king hastthou seen that which backsliding israel hath done she is gone up uponevery high mountain and under every green tree and there hath playedthe harlot and i said after she had done all these things turn thou unto mebut she returned not and her treacherous sister judah saw it and i saw when for all the causes whereby backsliding israelcommitted adultery i had put her away and given her a bill ofdivorce yet her treacherous sister judah feared not but went andplayed the harlot also and it came to pass through the lightness of her whoredom thatshe defiled the land and committed adultery with stones and withstocks and yet for all this her treacherous sister judah hath not turnedunto me with her whole heart but feignedly saith the lord and the lord said unto me the backsliding israel hath justifiedherself more than treacherous judah go and proclaim these words toward the north and say returnthou backsliding israel saith the lord and i will not cause mineanger to fall upon you for i am merciful saith the lord and i willnot keep anger for ever only acknowledge thine iniquity that thou hast transgressedagainst the lord thy god and hast scattered thy ways to the strangersunder every green tree and ye have not obeyed my voice saith thelord turn o backsliding children saith the lord for i am marriedunto you and i will take you one of a city and two of a family andi will bring you to zion  and i will give you pastors accordingto mine heart which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding and it shall come to pass when ye be multiplied and increased inthe land in those days saith the lord they shall say no more theark of the covenant of the lord neither shall it come to mindneither shall they remember it neither shall they visit it neithershall that be done any more at that time they shall call jerusalem the throne of the lordand all the nations shall be gathered unto it to the name of thelord to jerusalem neither shall they walk any more after theimagination of their evil heart in those days the house of judah shall walk with the house ofisrael and they shall come together out of the land of the north tothe land that i have given for an inheritance unto your fathers but i said how shall i put thee among the children and givethee a pleasant land a goodly heritage of the hosts of nations and isaid thou shalt call me my father and shalt not turn away from me surely as a wife treacherously departeth from her husband sohave ye dealt treacherously with me o house of israel saith thelord a voice was heard upon the high places weeping and supplicationsof the children of israel for they have perverted their way and theyhave forgotten the lord their god return ye backsliding children and i will heal yourbackslidingsbehold we come unto thee for thou art the lord our god truly in vain is salvation hoped for from the hills and from themultitude of mountains truly in the lord our god is the salvation ofisrael for shame hath devoured the labour of our fathers from our youththeir flocks and their herds their sons and their daughters we lie down in our shame and our confusion covereth us for wehave sinned against the lord our god we and our fathers from ouryouth even unto this day and have not obeyed the voice of the lordour god if thou wilt return o israel saith the lord return unto me andif thou wilt put away thine abominations out of my sight then shaltthou not remove and thou shalt swear the lord liveth in truth in judgment andin righteousness and the nations shall bless themselves in him andin him shall they glory for thus saith the lord to the men of judah and jerusalem breakup your fallow ground and sow not among thorns circumcise yourselves to the lord and take away the foreskins ofyour heart ye men of judah and inhabitants of jerusalem lest my furycome forth like fire and burn that none can quench it because of theevil of your doings declare ye in judah and publish in jerusalem and say blow yethe trumpet in the land cry gather together and say assembleyourselves and let us go into the defenced cities set up the standard toward zion retire stay not for i willbring evil from the north and a great destruction the lion is come up from his thicket and the destroyer of thegentiles is on his way he is gone forth from his place to make thyland desolate and thy cities shall be laid waste without aninhabitant for this gird you with sackcloth lament and howl for the fierceanger of the lord is not turned back from us and it shall come to pass at that day saith the lord that theheart of the king shall perish and the heart of the princes and thepriests shall be astonished and the prophets shall wonder then said i ah lord god surely thou hast greatly deceived thispeople and jerusalem saying ye shall have peace whereas the swordreacheth unto the soul at that time shall it be said to this people and to jerusalem adry wind of the high places in the wilderness toward the daughter ofmy people not to fan nor to cleanse  even a full wind fromthose places shall come unto me now also will i give sentence againstthem behold he shall come up as clouds and his chariots shall be asa whirlwind his horses are swifter than eagles woe unto us for weare spoiled o jerusalem wash thine heart from wickedness that thou mayestbe saved how long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee  for a voice declareth from dan and publisheth affliction from mountephraim make ye mention to the nations behold publish againstjerusalem that watchers come from a far country and give out theirvoice against the cities of judah as keepers of a field are they against her round about becauseshe hath been rebellious against me saith the lord thy way and thy doings have procured these things unto thee thisis thy wickedness because it is bitter because it reacheth untothine heart my bowels my bowels i am pained at my very heart my heartmaketh a noise in me i cannot hold my peace because thou hast heardo my soul the sound of the trumpet the alarm of war destruction upon destruction is cried for the whole land isspoiled suddenly are my tents spoiled and my curtains in a moment how long shall i see the standard and hear the sound of thetrumpet   for my people is foolish they have not known me theyare sottish children and they have none understanding they are wiseto do evil but to do good they have no knowledge i beheld the earth and lo it was without form and void andthe heavens and they had no light i beheld the mountains and lo they trembled and all the hillsmoved lightly i beheld and lo there was no man and all the birds of theheavens were fled i beheld and lo the fruitful place was a wilderness and allthe cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the lord andby his fierce anger for thus hath the lord said the whole land shall be desolateyet will i not make a full end for this shall the earth mourn and the heavens above be blackbecause i have spoken it i have purposed it and will not repentneither will i turn back from it the whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen andbowmen they shall go into thickets and climb up upon the rocksevery city shall be forsaken and not a man dwell therein and when thou art spoiled what wilt thou do though thouclothest thyself with crimson though thou deckest thee with ornamentsof gold though thou rentest thy face with painting in vain shaltthou make thyself fair thy lovers will despise thee they will seekthy life for i have heard a voice as of a woman in travail and theanguish as of her that bringeth forth her first child the voice ofthe daughter of zion that bewaileth herself that spreadeth herhands saying woe is me now for my soul is wearied because ofmurderers run ye to and fro through the streets of jerusalem and see nowand know and seek in the broad places thereof if ye can find a manif there be any that executeth judgment that seeketh the truth and iwill pardon it and though they say the lord liveth surely they swear falsely o lord are not thine eyes upon the truth thou hast strickenthem but they have not grieved thou hast consumed them but theyhave refused to receive correction they have made their faces harderthan a rock they have refused to return therefore i said surely these are poor they are foolish forthey know not the way of the lord nor the judgment of their god i will get me unto the great men and will speak unto them forthey have known the way of the lord and the judgment of their godbut these have altogether broken the yoke and burst the bonds wherefore a lion out of the forest shall slay them and a wolf ofthe evenings shall spoil them a leopard shall watch over theircities every one that goeth out thence shall be torn in piecesbecause their transgressions are many and their backslidings areincreased how shall i pardon thee for this thy children have forsaken meand sworn by them that are no gods when i had fed them to the fullthey then committed adultery and assembled themselves by troops inthe harlots houses they were as fed horses in the morning every one neighed afterhis neighbours wife shall i not visit for these things saith the lord and shall notmy soul be avenged on such a nation as this   go ye up upon herwalls and destroy but make not a full end take away herbattlements for they are not the lords for the house of israel and the house of judah have dealt verytreacherously against me saith the lord they have belied the lord and said it is not he neither shallevil come upon us neither shall we see sword nor famine  and theprophets shall become wind and the word is not in them thus shall itbe done unto them wherefore thus saith the lord god of hosts because ye speak thisword behold i will make my words in thy mouth fire and this peoplewood and it shall devour them lo i will bring a nation upon you from far o house of israelsaith the lord it is a mighty nation it is an ancient nation anation whose language thou knowest not neither understandest whatthey say their quiver is as an open sepulchre they are all mighty men and they shall eat up thine harvest and thy bread which thysons and thy daughters should eat they shall eat up thy flocks andthine herds they shall eat up thy vines and thy fig trees they shallimpoverish thy fenced cities wherein thou trustedst with the sword nevertheless in those days saith the lord i will not make afull end with you and it shall come to pass when ye shall say wherefore doeth thelord our god all these things unto us then shalt thou answer themlike as ye have forsaken me and served strange gods in your land soshall ye serve strangers in a land that is not yours declare this in the house of jacob and publish it in judahsaying

sand for the bound of the sea by aperpetual decree that it cannot pass it and though the waves thereoftoss themselves yet can they not prevail though they roar yet canthey not pass over it   but this people hath a revolting and arebellious heart they are revolted and gone neither say they in their heart let us now fear the lord ourgod that giveth rain both the former and the latter in his seasonhe reserveth unto us the appointed weeks of the harvest your iniquities have turned away these things and your sins havewithholden good things from you for among my people are found wicked men they lay

yea they overpass the deeds ofthe wicked they judge not the cause the cause of the fatherless yetthey prosper and the right of the needy do they not judge shall i not visit for these things saith the lord shall not mysoul be avenged on such a nation as this   a wonderful andhorrible thing is committed in the land  the prophets prophesyfalsely and the priests bear rule by their means and my people loveto have it so and what will ye do in the end thereof   o yechildren of benjamin gather yourselves to flee out of the midst ofjerusalem and blow the trumpet in tekoa and set up a sign of fire inbethhaccerem for evil appeareth out of the north and greatdestruction i have likened the daughter of zion to a comely and delicatewoman the shepherds with their flocks shall come unto her they shallpitch their tents against her round about they shall feed every onein his place prepare ye war against her arise and let us go up at noon woeunto us for the day goeth away for the shadows of the evening arestretched out arise and let us go by night and let us destroy her palaces for thus hath the lord of hosts said hew ye down trees and casta mount against jerusalem this is the city to be

thou instructed o jerusalem lest my soul depart from theelest i make thee desolate a land not inhabited thus saith the lord of hosts they shall throughly glean theremnant of israel as a vine turn back thine hand as a grapegathererinto the baskets to whom shall i speak and give warning that they may hearbehold their ear is uncircumcised and they cannot hearken beholdthe word of the lord is unto them a reproach they have no delight init therefore i am full of the fury of the lord i am weary withholding in i will pour it out upon the children abroad and upon theassembly of young men together for even the husband with the wifeshall be taken the aged with him that is full of days and their houses shall be turned unto others with their fieldsand wives together for i will stretch out my hand upon theinhabitants of the land saith the lord for from the least of them even unto the greatest of them everyone is given to covetousness and from the prophet even unto thepriest every one dealeth falsely they have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my peopleslightly saying peace peace when there is no peace were they ashamed when they had committed abomination nay theywere not at all ashamed neither could they blush therefore theyshall fall among them that fall at the time that i visit them theyshall be cast down saith the lord thus saith the lord stand ye in the ways and see and ask forthe old paths where is the good way and walk therein and ye shallfind rest for your souls but they said we will not walk therein also i set watchmen over you saying hearken to the sound of thetrumpet but they said we will not hearken therefore hear ye nations and know o congregation what isamong them hear o earth behold i will bring evil upon this people eventhe fruit of their thoughts because they have not hearkened unto mywords nor to my law but rejected it to what purpose cometh there to me incense from sheba and thesweet cane from a far country your burnt offerings are notacceptable nor your sacrifices sweet unto me therefore thus saith the lord behold i will lay stumblingblocksbefore this people and the fathers and the sons together shall fallupon them the neighbour and his friend shall perish thus saith the lord behold a people cometh from the northcountry and a great nation shall be raised from the sides of theearth they shall lay hold on bow and spear they are cruel and have nomercy their voice roareth like the sea and they ride upon horsesset in array as men for war against thee o daughter of zion we have heard the fame thereof our hands wax feeble anguishhath taken hold of us and pain as of a woman in travail go not forth into the field nor walk by the way for the swordof the enemy and fear is on every side o daughter of my people gird thee with sackcloth and wallowthyself in ashes make thee mourning as for an only son most bitterlamentation for the spoiler shall suddenly come upon us i have set thee for a tower and a fortress among my people thatthou mayest know and try their way they are all grievous revolters walking with slanders they arebrass and iron they are all corrupters the bellows are burned the lead is consumed of the fire thefounder melteth in vain for the wicked are not plucked away reprobate silver shall men call them because the lord hathrejected them the word that came to jeremiah from the lord saying  stand inthe gate of the lords house and proclaim there this word and sayhear the word of the lord all ye of judah that enter in at thesegates to worship the lord thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel amend your waysand your doings and i will cause you to dwell in this place trust ye not in lying words saying the temple of the lord thetemple of the lord the temple of the lord are these for if ye throughly amend your ways and your doings if yethroughly execute judgment between a man and his neighbour  if yeoppress not the stranger the fatherless and the widow and shed notinnocent blood in this place neither walk after other gods to yourhurt  then will i cause you to dwell in this place in the landthat i gave to your fathers for ever and ever behold ye trust in lying words that cannot profit will ye steal murder and commit adultery and swear falsely andburn incense unto baal and walk after other gods whom ye know not and come and stand before me in this house which is called by myname and say we are delivered to do all these abominations   isthis house which is called by my name become a den of robbers inyour eyes behold even i have seen it saith the lord but go ye now unto my place which was in shiloh where i set myname at the first and see what i did to it for the wickedness of mypeople israel and now because ye have done all these works saith the lordand i spake unto you rising up early and speaking but ye heard notand i called you but ye answered not  therefore will i do untothis house which is called by my name wherein ye trust and unto theplace which i gave to you and to your fathers as i have done toshiloh and i will cast you out of my sight as i have cast out all yourbrethren even the whole seed of ephraim therefore pray not thou for this people neither lift up cry norprayer for them neither make intercession to me for i will not hearthee seest thou not what they do in the cities of judah and in thestreets of jerusalem   the children gather wood and the fatherskindle the fire and the women knead their dough to make cakes to thequeen of heaven and to pour out drink offerings unto other gods thatthey may provoke me to anger do they provoke me to anger saith the lord do they not provokethemselves to the confusion of their own faces   therefore thussaith the lord god behold mine anger and my fury shall be poured outupon this place upon man and upon beast and upon the trees of thefield and upon the fruit of the ground and it shall burn and shallnot be quenched thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel put your burntofferings unto your sacrifices and eat flesh for i spake not unto your fathers nor commanded them in the daythat i brought them out of the land of egypt concerning burntofferings or sacrifices  but this thing commanded i them sayingobey my voice and i will be your god and ye shall be my people andwalk ye in all the ways that i have commanded you that it may be wellunto you but they hearkened not nor inclined their ear but walked in thecounsels and in the imagination of their evil heart and wentbackward and not forward since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land ofegypt unto this day i have even sent unto you all my servants theprophets daily rising up early and sending them  yet theyhearkened not unto me nor inclined their ear but hardened theirneck they did worse than their fathers therefore thou shalt speak all these words unto them but theywill not hearken to thee thou shalt also call unto them but theywill not answer thee but thou shalt say unto them this is a nation that obeyeth notthe voice of the lord their god nor receiveth correction truth isperished and is cut off from their mouth cut off thine hair o jerusalem and cast it away and take up alamentation on high places for the lord hath rejected and forsakenthe generation of his wrath for the children of judah have done evil in my sight saith thelord they have set their abominations in the house which is called bymy name to pollute it and they have built the high places of tophet which is in thevalley of the son of hinnom to burn their sons and their daughters inthe fire which i commanded them not neither came it into my heart therefore behold the days come saith the lord that it shallno more be called tophet nor the valley of the son of hinnom but thevalley of slaughter for they shall bury in tophet till there be noplace and the carcases of this people shall be meat for the fowls ofthe heaven and for the beasts of the earth and none shall fray themaway then will i cause to cease from the cities of judah and from thestreets of jerusalem the voice of mirth and the voice of gladnessthe voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride for the landshall be desolate at that time saith the lord they shall bring out the bones ofthe kings of judah and the bones of his princes and the bones of thepriests and the bones of the prophets and the bones of theinhabitants of jerusalem out of their graves  and they shallspread them before the sun and the moon and all the host of heavenwhom they have loved and whom they have served and after whom theyhave walked and whom they have sought and whom they have worshippedthey shall not be gathered nor be buried they shall be for dung uponthe face of the earth and death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue ofthem that remain of this evil family which remain in all the placeswhither i have driven them saith the lord of hosts moreover thou shalt say unto them thus saith the lord shall theyfall and not arise shall he turn away and not return   why thenis this people of jerusalem slidden back by a perpetual backslidingthey hold fast deceit they refuse to return i hearkened and heard but they spake not aright no man repentedhim of his wickedness saying what have i done every one turned tohis course as the horse rusheth into the battle yea the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times and theturtle and the crane and the swallow observe the time of their comingbut my people know not the judgment of the lord how do ye say we are wise and the law of the lord is with uslo certainly in vain made he it the pen of the scribes is in vain the wise men are ashamed they are dismayed and taken lo theyhave rejected the word of the lord and what wisdom is in them  therefore will i give their wives unto others and their fields tothem that shall inherit them for every one from the least even untothe greatest is given to covetousness from the prophet even unto thepriest every one dealeth falsely for they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my peopleslightly saying peace peace when there is no peace were they ashamed when they had committed abomination nay theywere not at all ashamed neither could they blush therefore shallthey fall among them that fall in the time of their visitation theyshall be cast down saith the lord i will surely consume them saith the lord there shall be nograpes on the vine nor figs on the fig tree and the leaf shall fadeand the things that i have given them shall pass away from them why do we sit still assemble yourselves and let us enter intothe defenced cities and let us be silent there for the lord our godhath put us to silence and given us water of gall to drink becausewe have sinned against the lord we looked for peace but no good came and for a time of healthand behold trouble   the snorting of his horses was heard fromdan the whole land trembled at the sound of the neighing of hisstrong ones for they are come and have devoured the land and allthat is in it the city and those that dwell therein for behold i will send serpents cockatrices among you whichwill not be charmed and they shall bite you saith the lord when i would comfort myself against sorrow my heart is faint inme behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people becauseof them that dwell in a far country is not the lord in zion is nother king in her why have they provoked me to anger with their gravenimages and with strange vanities   the harvest is past thesummer is ended and we are not saved for the hurt of the daughter of my people am i hurt i am blackastonishment hath taken hold on me is there no balm in gilead is there no physician there why thenis not the health of the daughter of my people recovered   oh thatmy head were waters and mine eyes a fountain of tears that i mightweep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people   ohthat i had in the wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring men that imight leave my people and go from them for they be all adulterersan assembly of treacherous men and they bend their tongues like their bow for lies but they arenot valiant for the truth upon the earth for they proceed from evilto evil and they know not me saith the lord take ye heed every one of his neighbour and trust ye not in anybrother for every brother will utterly supplant and every neighbourwill walk with slanders and they will deceive every one his neighbour and will not speakthe truth they have taught their tongue to speak lies and wearythemselves to commit iniquity thine habitation is in the midst of deceit through deceit theyrefuse to know me saith the lord therefore thus saith the lord of hosts behold i will melt themand try them for how shall i do for the daughter of my people  their tongue is as an arrow shot out it speaketh deceit one speakethpeaceably to his neighbour with his mouth but in heart he layeth hiswait shall i not visit them for these things saith the lord shall notmy soul be avenged on such a nation as this   for the mountainswill i take up a weeping and wailing and for the habitations of thewilderness a lamentation because they are burned up so that none canpass through them neither can men hear the voice of the cattle boththe fowl of the heavens and the beast are fled they are gone and i will make jerusalem heaps and a den of dragons and i willmake the cities of judah desolate without an inhabitant who is the wise man that may understand this and who is he towhom the mouth of the lord hath spoken that he may declare it forwhat the land perisheth and is burned up like a wilderness that nonepasseth through   and the lord saith because they have forsakenmy law which i set before them and have not obeyed my voice neitherwalked therein  but have walked after the imagination of theirown heart and after baalim which their fathers taught them therefore thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel behold iwill feed them even this people with wormwood and give them waterof gall to drink i will scatter them also among the heathen whom neither they northeir fathers have known and i will send a sword after them till ihave consumed them thus saith the lord of hosts consider ye and call for themourning women that they may come and send for cunning women thatthey may come  and let them make haste and take up a wailing forus that our eyes may run down with tears and our eyelids gush outwith waters for a voice of wailing is heard out of zion how are we spoiledwe are greatly confounded because we have forsaken the land becauseour dwellings have cast us out yet hear the word of the lord o ye women and let your earreceive the word of his mouth and teach your daughters wailing andevery one her neighbour lamentation for death is come up into our windows and is entered into ourpalaces to cut off the children from without and the young men fromthe streets speak thus saith the lord even the carcases of men shall fallas dung upon the open field and as the handful after the harvestmanand none shall gather them thus saith the lord let not the wise man glory in his wisdomneither let the mighty man glory in his might let not the rich manglory in his riches  but let him that glorieth glory in thisthat he understandeth and knoweth me that i am the lord whichexercise lovingkindness judgment and righteousness in the earthfor in these things i delight saith the lord behold the days come saith the lord that i will punish allthem which are circumcised with the uncircumcised  egypt andjudah and edom and the children of ammon and moab and all that arein the utmost corners that dwell in the wilderness for all thesenations are uncircumcised and all the house of israel areuncircumcised in the heart hear ye the word which the lord speaketh unto you o house ofisrael  thus saith the lord learn not the way of the heathenand be not dismayed at the signs of heaven for the heathen aredismayed at them for the customs of the people are vain for one cutteth a treeout of the forest the work of the hands of the workman with the axe they deck it with silver and with gold they fasten it with nailsand with hammers that it move not they are upright as the palm tree but speak not they must needsbe borne because they cannot go be not afraid of them for theycannot do evil neither also is it in them to do good forasmuch as there is none like unto thee o lord thou artgreat and thy name is great in might who would not fear thee o king of nations for to thee doth itappertain forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations and inall their kingdoms there is none like unto thee but they are altogether brutish and foolish the stock is adoctrine of vanities silver spread into plates is brought from tarshish and gold fromuphaz the work of the workman and of the hands of the founder blueand purple is their clothing they are all the work of cunning men but the lord is the true god he is the living god and aneverlasting king at his wrath the earth shall tremble and thenations shall not be able to abide his indignation thus shall ye say unto them the gods that have not made theheavens and the earth even they shall perish from the earth and fromunder these heavens he hath made the earth by his power he hath established theworld by his wisdom and hath stretched out the heavens by hisdiscretion when he uttereth his voice there is a multitude of waters inthe heavens and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of theearth he maketh lightnings with rain and bringeth forth the wind outof his treasures every man is brutish in his knowledge every founder isconfounded by the graven image for his molten image is falsehood andthere is no breath in them they are vanity and the work of errors in the time of theirvisitation they shall perish the portion of jacob is not like them for he is the former ofall things and israel is the rod of his inheritance the lord ofhosts is his name gather up thy wares out of the land o inhabitant of thefortress for thus saith the lord behold i will sling out theinhabitants of the land at this once and will distress them thatthey may find it so woe is me for my hurt my wound is grievous but i said trulythis is a grief and i must bear it my tabernacle is spoiled and all my cords are broken mychildren are gone forth of me and they are not there is none tostretch forth my tent any more and to set up my curtains for the pastors are become brutish and have not sought thelord therefore they shall not prosper and all their flocks shall bescattered behold the noise of the bruit is come and a great commotionout of the north country to make the cities of judah desolate and aden of dragons o lord i know that the way of man is not in himself it is notin man that walketh to direct his steps o lord correct me but with judgment not in thine anger lestthou bring me to nothing pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not and uponthe families that call not on thy name for they have eaten up jacoband devoured him and consumed him and have made his habitationdesolate the word that came to jeremiah from the lord saying  hear yethe words of this covenant and speak unto the men of judah and tothe inhabitants of jerusalem  and say thou unto them thus saiththe lord god of israel cursed be the man that obeyeth not the wordsof this covenant  which i commanded your fathers in the day thati brought them forth out of the land of egypt from the iron furnacesaying obey my voice and do them according to all which i commandyou so shall ye be my people and i will be your god  that i mayperform the oath which i have sworn unto your fathers to give them aland flowing with milk and honey as it is this day then answered iand said so be it o lord then the lord said unto me proclaim all these words in thecities of judah and in the streets of jerusalem saying hear ye thewords of this covenant and do them for i earnestly protested unto your fathers in the day that ibrought them up out of the land of egypt even unto this day risingearly and protesting saying obey my voice yet they obeyed not nor inclined their ear but walked every onein the imagination of their evil heart therefore i will bring uponthem all the words of this covenant which i commanded them to do butthey did them not and the lord said unto me a conspiracy is found among the men ofjudah and among the inhabitants of jerusalem they are turned back to the iniquities of their forefatherswhich refused to hear my words and they went after other gods toserve them the house of israel and the house of judah have broken mycovenant which i made with their fathers therefore thus saith the lord behold i will bring evil uponthem which they shall not be able to escape and though they shallcry unto me i will not hearken unto them then shall the cities of judah and inhabitants of jerusalem goand cry unto the gods unto whom they offer incense but they shall notsave them at all in the time of their trouble for according to the number of thy cities were thy gods ojudah and according to the number of the streets of jerusalem have yeset up altars to that shameful thing even altars to burn incense untobaal therefore pray not thou for this people neither lift up a cryor prayer for them for i will not hear them in the time that they cryunto me for their trouble what hath my beloved to do in mine house seeing she hathwrought lewdness with many and the holy flesh is passed from theewhen thou doest evil then thou rejoicest the lord called thy name a green olive tree fair and ofgoodly fruit with the noise of a great tumult he hath kindled fireupon it and the branches of it are broken for the lord of hosts that planted thee hath pronounced evilagainst thee for the evil of the house of israel and of the house ofjudah which they have done against themselves to provoke me to angerin offering incense unto baal and the lord hath given me knowledge of it and i know it thenthou shewedst me their doings but i was like a lamb or an ox that is brought to the slaughterand i knew not that they had devised devices against me saying letus destroy the tree with the fruit thereof and let us cut him offfrom the land of the living that his name may be no more remembered but o lord of hosts that judgest righteously that triest thereins and the heart let me see thy vengeance on them for unto theehave i revealed my cause therefore thus saith the lord of the men of anathoth that seekthy life saying prophesy not in the name of the lord that thou dienot by our hand  therefore thus saith the lord of hosts beholdi will punish them the young men shall die by the sword their sonsand their daughters shall die by famine  and there shall be noremnant of them for i will bring evil upon the men of anathoth eventhe year of their visitation righteous art thou o lord when i plead with thee yet let metalk with thee of thy judgments wherefore doth the way of the wickedprosper  wherefore are all they happy that deal very treacherously thou hast planted them yea they have taken root they growyea they bring forth fruit thou art near in their mouth and farfrom their reins but thou o lord knowest me thou hast seen me and tried mineheart toward thee pull them out like sheep for the slaughter andprepare them for the day of slaughter how long shall the land mourn and the herbs of every fieldwither for the wickedness of them that dwell therein the beasts areconsumed and the birds because they said he shall not see our lastend if thou hast run with the footmen and they have wearied theethen how canst thou contend with horses and if in the land of peacewherein thou trustedst they wearied thee then how wilt thou do inthe swelling of jordan   for even thy brethren and the house ofthy father even they have dealt treacherously with thee yea theyhave called a multitude after thee believe them not though theyspeak fair words unto thee i have forsaken mine house i have left mine heritage i havegiven the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies mine heritage is unto me as a lion in the forest it crieth outagainst me therefore have i hated it mine heritage is unto me as a speckled bird the birds roundabout are against her come ye assemble all the beasts of the fieldcome to devour many pastors have destroyed my vineyard they have trodden myportion under foot they have made my pleasant portion a desolatewilderness they have made it desolate and being desolate it mourneth untome the whole land is made desolate because no man layeth it toheart the spoilers are come upon all high places through thewilderness for the sword of the lord shall devour from the one end ofthe land even to the other end of the land no flesh shall have peace they have sown wheat but shall reap thorns they have putthemselves to pain but shall not profit and they shall be ashamed ofyour revenues because of the fierce anger of the lord thus saith the lord against all mine evil neighbours that touchthe inheritance which i have caused my people israel to inheritbehold i will pluck them out of their land and pluck out the houseof judah from among them and it shall come to pass after that i have plucked them out iwill return and have compassion on them and will bring them againevery man to his heritage and every man to his land and it shall come to pass if they will diligently learn theways of my people to swear by my name the lord liveth as theytaught my people to swear by baal then shall they be built in themidst of my people but if they will not obey i will utterly pluck up and destroythat nation saith the lord thus saith the lord unto me go and get thee a linen girdle andput it upon thy loins and put it not in water so i got a girdle according to the word of the lord and put iton my loins and the word of the lord came unto me the second time saying take the girdle that thou hast got which is upon thy loins andarise go to euphrates and hide it there in a hole of the rock so i went and hid it by euphrates as the lord commanded me and it came to pass after many days that the lord said unto mearise go to euphrates and take the girdle from thence which icommanded thee to hide there then i went to euphrates and digged and took the girdle fromthe place where i had hid it and behold the girdle was marred itwas profitable for nothing then the word of the lord came unto me saying  thus saiththe lord after this manner will i mar the pride of judah and thegreat pride of jerusalem this evil people which refuse to hear my words which walk inthe imagination of their heart and walk after other gods to servethem and to worship them shall even be as this girdle which is goodfor nothing for as the girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man so have icaused to cleave unto me the whole house of israel and the whole houseof judah saith the lord that they might be unto me for a people andfor a name and for a praise and for a glory but they would nothear therefore thou shalt speak unto them this word thus saith thelord god of israel every bottle shall be filled with wine and theyshall say unto thee do we not certainly know that every bottle shallbe filled with wine   then shalt thou say unto them thus saiththe lord behold i will fill all the inhabitants of this land eventhe kings that sit upon davids throne and the priests and theprophets and all the inhabitants of jerusalem with drunkenness and i will dash them one against another even the fathers andthe sons together saith the lord i will not pity nor spare norhave mercy but destroy them hear ye and give ear be not proud for the lord hath spoken give glory to the lord your god before he cause darkness andbefore your feet stumble upon the dark mountains and while ye lookfor light he turn it into the shadow of death and make it grossdarkness but if ye will not hear it my soul shall weep in secret placesfor your pride and mine eye shall weep sore and run down with tearsbecause the lords flock is carried away captive say unto the king and to the queen humble yourselves sit downfor your principalities shall come down even the crown of your glory the cities of the south shall be shut up and none shall openthem judah shall be carried away captive all of it it shall bewholly carried away captive lift up your eyes and behold them that come from the northwhere is the flock that was given thee thy beautiful flock  what wilt thou say when he shall punish thee for thou hast taughtthem to be captains and as chief over thee shall not sorrows takethee as a woman in travail   and if thou say in thine heartwherefore come these things upon me  for the greatness of thineiniquity are thy skirts discovered and thy heels made bare can the ethiopian change his skin or the leopard his spotsthen may ye also do good that are accustomed to do evil therefore will i scatter them as the stubble that passeth awayby the wind of the wilderness this is thy lot the portion of thy measures from me saith thelord because thou hast forgotten me and trusted in falsehood therefore will i discover thy skirts upon thy face that thyshame may appear i have seen thine adulteries and thy neighings the lewdness ofthy whoredom and thine abominations on the hills in the fields woeunto thee o jerusalem wilt thou not be made clean when shall itonce be   the word of the lord that came to jeremiah concerningthe dearth judah mourneth and the gates thereof languish they are blackunto the ground and the cry of jerusalem is gone up and their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters theycame to the pits and found no water they returned with their vesselsempty they were ashamed and confounded and covered their heads because the ground is chapt for there was no rain in the earththe plowmen were ashamed they covered their heads yea the hind also calved in the field and forsook it becausethere was no grass and the wild asses did stand in the high places they snuffed upthe wind like dragons their eyes did fail because there was nograss o lord though our iniquities testify against us do thou it forthy names sake for our backslidings are many we have sinned againstthee o the hope of israel the saviour thereof in time of trouble whyshouldest thou be as a stranger in the land and as a wayfaring manthat turneth aside to tarry for a night   why shouldest thou beas a man astonied as a mighty man that cannot save yet thou o lordart in the midst of us and we are called by thy name leave us not thus saith the lord unto this people thus have they loved towander they have not refrained their feet therefore the lord dothnot accept them he will now remember their iniquity and visit theirsins then said the lord unto me pray not for this people for theirgood when they fast i will not hear their cry and when they offerburnt offering and an oblation i will not accept them but i willconsume them by the sword and by the famine and by the pestilence then said i ah lord god behold the prophets say unto themye shall not see the sword neither shall ye have famine but i willgive you assured peace in this place then the lord said unto me the prophets prophesy lies in myname i sent them not neither have i commanded them neither spakeunto them they prophesy unto you a false vision and divination and athing of nought and the deceit of their heart therefore thus saith the lord concerning the prophets thatprophesy in my name and i sent them not yet they say sword andfamine shall not be in this land by sword and famine shall thoseprophets be consumed and the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in thestreets of jerusalem because of the famine and the sword and theyshall have none to bury them them their wives nor their sons northeir daughters for i will pour their wickedness upon them therefore thou shalt say this word unto them let mine eyes rundown with tears night and day and let them not cease for the virgindaughter of my people is broken with a great breach with a verygrievous blow if i go forth into the field then behold the slain with thesword  and if i enter into the city then behold them that are sickwith famine  yea both the prophet and the priest go about into aland that they know not hast thou utterly rejected judah hath thy soul lothed zion whyhast thou smitten us and there is no healing for us we looked forpeace and there is no good and for the time of healing and beholdtrouble   we acknowledge o lord our wickedness and theiniquity of our fathers for we have sinned against thee do not abhor us for thy names sake do not disgrace the throneof thy glory remember break not thy covenant with us are there any among the vanities of the gentiles that can causerain or can the heavens give showers art not thou he o lord ourgod  therefore we will wait upon thee for thou hast made all thesethings then said the lord unto me though moses and samuel stood beforeme yet my mind could not be toward this people cast them out of mysight and let them go forth and it shall come to pass if they say unto thee whither shallwe go forth then thou shalt tell them thus saith the lord such asare for death to death and such as are for the sword to the swordand such as are for the famine to the famine and such as are for thecaptivity to the captivity and i will appoint over them four kinds saith the lord thesword to slay and the dogs to tear and the fowls of the heaven andthe beasts of the earth to devour and destroy and i will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of theearth because of manasseh the son of hezekiah king of judah for thatwhich he did in jerusalem for who shall have pity upon thee o jerusalem or who shallbemoan thee or who shall go aside to ask how thou doest   thouhast forsaken me saith the lord thou art gone backward thereforewill i stretch out my hand against thee and destroy thee i am wearywith repenting and i will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land i willbereave them of children i will destroy my people since they returnnot from their ways their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas ihave brought upon them against the mother of the young men a spoilerat noonday i have caused him to fall upon it suddenly and terrorsupon the city she that hath borne seven languisheth she hath given up theghost her sun is gone down while it was yet day she hath beenashamed and confounded and the residue of them will i deliver to thesword before their enemies saith the lord woe is me my mother that thou hast borne me a man of strifeand a man of contention to the whole earth i have neither lent onusury nor men have lent to me on usury yet every one of them dothcurse me the lord said verily it shall be well with thy remnant verilyi will cause the enemy to entreat thee well in the time of evil and inthe time of affliction shall iron break the northern iron and the steel   thysubstance and thy treasures will i give to the spoil without priceand that for all thy sins even in all thy borders and i will make thee to pass with thine enemies into a landwhich thou knowest not for a fire is kindled in mine anger whichshall burn upon you o lord thou knowest remember me and visit me and revenge meof my persecutors take me not away in thy longsuffering know thatfor thy sake i have suffered rebuke thy words were found and i did eat them and thy word was untome the joy and rejoicing of mine heart for i am called by thy name olord god of hosts i sat not in the assembly of the mockers nor rejoiced i satalone because of thy hand for thou hast filled me with indignation why is my pain perpetual and my wound incurable which refusethto be healed wilt thou be altogether unto me as a liar and as watersthat fail   therefore thus saith the lord if thou return thenwill i bring thee again and thou shalt stand before me and if thoutake forth the precious from the vile thou shalt be as my mouth letthem return unto thee but return not thou unto them and i will make thee unto this people a fenced brasen wall andthey shall fight against thee but they shall not prevail againstthee for i am with thee to save thee and to deliver thee saith thelord and i will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked and iwill redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible the word of the lord came also unto me saying  thou shaltnot take thee a wife neither shalt thou have sons or daughters inthis place for thus saith the lord concerning the sons and concerning thedaughters that are born in this place and concerning their mothersthat bare them and concerning their fathers that begat them in thisland  they shall die of grievous deaths they shall not belamented neither shall they be buried but they shall be as dung uponthe face of the earth and they shall be consumed by the sword and byfamine and their carcases shall be meat for the fowls of heaven andfor the beasts of the earth for thus saith the lord enter not into the house of mourningneither go to lament nor bemoan them for i have taken away my peacefrom this people saith the lord even lovingkindness and mercies both the great and the small shall die in this land they shallnot be buried neither shall men lament for them nor cut themselvesnor make themselves bald for them  neither shall men tearthemselves for them in mourning to comfort them for the dead neithershall men give them the cup of consolation to drink for their fatheror for their mother thou shalt not also go into the house of feasting to sit withthem to eat and to drink for thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel behold iwill cause to cease out of this place in your eyes and in your daysthe voice of mirth and the voice of gladness the voice of thebridegroom and the voice of the bride and it shall come to pass when thou shalt shew this people allthese words and they shall say unto thee wherefore hath the lordpronounced all this great evil against us or what is our iniquity orwhat is our sin that we have committed against the lord our god then shalt thou say unto them because your fathers haveforsaken me saith the lord and have walked after other gods andhave served them and have worshipped them and have forsaken me andhave not kept my law  and ye have done worse than your fathersfor behold ye walk every one after the imagination of his evilheart that they may not hearken unto me  therefore will i castyou out of this land into a land that ye know not neither ye nor yourfathers and there shall ye serve other gods day and night where iwill not shew you favour therefore behold the days come saith the lord that it shallno more be said the lord liveth that brought up the children ofisrael out of the land of egypt  but the lord liveth thatbrought up the children of israel from the land of the north and fromall the lands whither he had driven them and i will bring them againinto their land that i gave unto their fathers behold i will send for many fishers saith the lord and theyshall fish them and after will i send for many hunters and theyshall hunt them from every mountain and from every hill and out ofthe holes of the rocks for mine eyes are upon all their ways they are not hid from myface neither is their iniquity hid from mine eyes and first i will recompense their iniquity and their sin doublebecause they have defiled my land they have filled mine inheritancewith the carcases of their detestable and abominable things o lord my strength and my fortress and my refuge in the dayof affliction the gentiles shall come unto thee from the ends of theearth and shall say surely our fathers have inherited lies vanityand things wherein there is no profit shall a man make gods unto himself and they are no gods  therefore behold i will this once cause them to know i will causethem to know mine hand and my might and they shall know that my nameis the lord the sin of judah is written with a pen of iron and with thepoint of a diamond it is graven upon the table of their heart andupon the horns of your altars  whilst their children remembertheir altars and their groves by the green trees upon the high hills o my mountain in the field i will give thy substance and all thytreasures to the spoil and thy high places for sin throughout allthy borders and thou even thyself shalt discontinue from thine heritagethat i gave thee and i will cause thee to serve thine enemies in theland which thou knowest not for ye have kindled a fire in mine angerwhich shall burn for ever thus saith the lord cursed be the man that trusteth in man andmaketh flesh his arm and whose heart departeth from the lord for he shall be like the heath in the desert and shall not seewhen good cometh but shall inhabit the parched places in thewilderness in a salt land and not inhabited blessed is the man that trusteth in the lord and whose hope thelord is for he shall be as a tree planted by the waters and thatspreadeth out her roots by the river and shall not see when heatcometh but her leaf shall be green and shall not be careful in theyear of drought neither shall cease from yielding fruit the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wickedwho can know it   i the lord search the heart i try the reinseven to give every man according to his ways and according to thefruit of his doings as the partridge sitteth on eggs and hatcheth them not so hethat getteth riches and not by right shall leave them in the midstof his days and at his end shall be a fool a glorious high throne from the beginning is the place of oursanctuary o lord the hope of israel all that forsake thee shall beashamed and they that depart from me shall be written in the earthbecause they have forsaken the lord the fountain of living waters heal me o lord and i shall be healed save me and i shall besaved for thou art my praise behold they say unto me where is the word of the lord let itcome now as for me i have not hastened from being a pastor to followthee neither have i desired the woeful day thou knowest that whichcame out of my lips was right before thee be not a terror unto me thou art my hope in the day of evil let them be confounded that persecute me but let not me beconfounded let them be dismayed but let not me be dismayed bringupon them the day of evil and destroy them with double destruction thus said the lord unto me go and stand in the gate of thechildren of the people whereby the kings of judah come in and by thewhich they go out and in all the gates of jerusalem  and sayunto them hear ye the word of the lord ye kings of judah and alljudah and all the inhabitants of jerusalem that enter in by thesegates  thus saith the lord take heed to yourselves and bear noburden on the sabbath day nor bring it in by the gates of jerusalem neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sabbathday neither do ye any work but hallow ye the sabbath day as icommanded your fathers but they obeyed not neither inclined their ear but made theirneck stiff that they might not hear nor receive instruction and it shall come to pass if ye diligently hearken unto mesaith the lord to bring in no burden through the gates of this cityon the sabbath day but hallow the sabbath day to do no work therein then shall there enter into the gates of this city kings andprinces sitting upon the throne of david riding in chariots and onhorses they and their princes the men of judah and the inhabitantsof jerusalem and this city shall remain for ever and they shall come from the cities of judah and from theplaces about jerusalem and from the land of benjamin and from theplain and from the mountains and from the south bringing burntofferings and sacrifices and meat offerings and incense andbringing sacrifices of praise unto the house of the lord but if ye will not hearken unto me to hallow the sabbath dayand not to bear a burden even entering in at the gates of jerusalemon the sabbath day then will i kindle a fire in the gates thereofand it shall devour the palaces of jerusalem and it shall not bequenched the word which came to jeremiah from the lord saying arise and go down to the potters house and there i will cause theeto hear my words then i went down to the potters house and behold he wrought awork on the wheels and the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of thepotter so he made it again another vessel as seemed good to thepotter to make it then the word of the lord came to me saying  o house ofisrael cannot i do with you as this potter saith the lord beholdas the clay is in the potters hand so are ye in mine hand o houseof israel at what instant i shall speak concerning a nation and concerninga kingdom to pluck up and to pull down and to destroy it  ifthat nation against whom i have pronounced turn from their evil iwill repent of the evil that i thought to do unto them and at what instant i shall speak concerning a nation andconcerning a kingdom to build and to plant it  if it do evil inmy sight that it obey not my voice then i will repent of the goodwherewith i said i would benefit them now therefore go to speak to the men of judah and to theinhabitants of jerusalem saying thus saith the lord behold i frameevil against you and devise a device against you return ye now everyone from his evil way and make your ways and your doings good and they said there is no hope but we will walk after our owndevices and we will every one do the imagination of his evil heart therefore thus saith the lord ask ye now among the heathen whohath heard such things the virgin of israel hath done a very horriblething will a man leave the snow of lebanon which cometh from the rockof the field or shall the cold flowing waters that come from anotherplace be forsaken   because my people hath forgotten me theyhave burned incense to vanity and they have caused them to stumble intheir ways from the ancient paths to walk in paths in a way not castup  to make their land desolate and a perpetual hissing everyone that passeth thereby shall be astonished and wag his head i will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy iwill shew them the back and not the face in the day of theircalamity then said they come and let us devise devices against jeremiahfor the law shall not perish from the priest nor counsel from thewise nor the word from the prophet come and let us smite him withthe tongue and let us not give heed to any of his words give heed to me o lord and hearken to the voice of them thatcontend with me shall evil be recompensed for good for they have digged a pitfor my soul remember that i stood before thee to speak good for themand to turn away thy wrath from them therefore deliver up their children to the famine and pour outtheir blood by the force of the sword and let their wives be bereavedof their children and be widows and let their men be put to deathlet their young men be slain by the sword in battle let a cry be heard from their houses when thou shalt bring atroop suddenly upon them for they have digged a pit to take me andhid snares for my feet yet lord thou knowest all their counsel against me to slay meforgive not their iniquity neither blot out their sin from thy sightbut let them be overthrown before thee deal thus with them in thetime of thine anger thus saith the lord go and get a potters earthen bottle andtake of the ancients of the people and of the ancients of thepriests  and go forth unto the valley of the son of hinnom whichis by the entry of the east gate and proclaim there the words that ishall tell thee  and say hear ye the word of the lord o kingsof judah and inhabitants of jerusalem thus saith the lord of hoststhe god of israel behold i will bring evil upon this place thewhich whosoever heareth his ears shall tingle because they have forsaken me and have estranged this place andhave burned incense in it unto other gods whom neither they nor theirfathers have known nor the kings of judah and have filled this placewith the blood of innocents  they have built also the high placesof baal to burn their sons with fire for burnt offerings unto baalwhich i commanded not nor spake it neither came it into my mind therefore behold the days come saith the lord that this placeshall no more be called tophet nor the valley of the son of hinnombut the valley of slaughter and i will make void the counsel of judah and jerusalem in thisplace and i will cause them to fall by the sword before theirenemies and by the hands of them that seek their lives and theircarcases will i give to be meat for the fowls of the heaven and forthe beasts of the earth and i will make this city desolate and an hissing every onethat passeth thereby shall be astonished and hiss because of all theplagues thereof and i will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and theflesh of their daughters and they shall eat every one the flesh ofhis friend in the siege and straitness wherewith their enemies andthey that seek their lives shall straiten them then shalt thou break the bottle in the sight of the men that gowith thee  and shalt say unto them thus saith the lord ofhosts even so will i break this people and this city as one breaketha potters vessel that cannot be made whole again and they shallbury them in tophet till there be no place to bury thus will i do unto this place saith the lord and to theinhabitants thereof and even make this city as tophet  and thehouses of jerusalem and the houses of the kings of judah shall bedefiled as the place of tophet because of all the houses upon whoseroofs they have burned incense unto all the host of heaven and havepoured out drink offerings unto other gods then came jeremiah from tophet whither the lord had sent him toprophesy and he stood in the court of the lords house and said toall the people  thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israelbehold i will bring upon this city and upon all her towns all theevil that i have pronounced against it because they have hardenedtheir necks that they might not hear my words now pashur the son of immer the priest who was also chiefgovernor in the house of the lord heard that jeremiah prophesiedthese things then pashur smote jeremiah the prophet and put him in the stocksthat were in the high gate of benjamin which was by the house of thelord and it came to pass on the morrow that pashur brought forthjeremiah out of the stocks then said jeremiah unto him the lord hathnot called thy name pashur but magormissabib for thus saith the lord behold i will make thee a terror tothyself and to all thy friends and they shall fall by the sword oftheir enemies and thine eyes shall behold it and i will give alljudah into the hand of the king of babylon and he shall carry themcaptive into babylon and shall slay them with the sword moreover i will deliver all the strength of this city and allthe labours thereof and all the precious things thereof and all thetreasures of the kings of judah will i give into the hand of theirenemies which shall spoil them and take them and carry them tobabylon and thou pashur and all that dwell in thine house shall go intocaptivity and thou shalt come to babylon and there thou shalt dieand shalt be buried there thou and all thy friends to whom thouhast prophesied lies o lord thou hast deceived me and i was deceived thou artstronger than i and hast prevailed i am in derision daily every onemocketh me for since i spake i cried out i cried violence and spoilbecause the word of the lord was made a reproach unto me and aderision daily then i said i will not make mention of him nor speak any morein his name but his word was in mine heart as a burning fire shut upin my bones and i was weary with forbearing and i could not stay for i heard the defaming of many fear on every side reportsay they and we will report it all my familiars watched for myhalting saying peradventure he will be enticed and we shall prevailagainst him and we shall take our revenge on him but the lord is with me as a mighty terrible one therefore mypersecutors shall stumble and they shall not prevail they shall begreatly ashamed for they shall not prosper their everlastingconfusion shall never be forgotten but o lord of hosts that triest the righteous and seest thereins and the heart let me see thy vengeance on them for unto theehave i opened my cause sing unto the lord praise ye the lord for he hath deliveredthe soul of the poor from the hand of evildoers cursed be the day wherein i was born let not the day wherein mymother bare me be blessed cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father saying aman child is born unto thee making him very glad and let that man be as the cities which the lord overthrew andrepented not and let him hear the cry in the morning and theshouting at noontide  because he slew me not from the womb orthat my mother might have been my grave and her womb to be alwaysgreat with me wherefore came i forth out of the womb to see labour and sorrowthat my days should be consumed with shame   the word which cameunto jeremiah from the lord when king zedekiah sent unto him pashurthe son of melchiah and zephaniah the son of maaseiah the priestsaying  enquire i pray thee of the lord for us fornebuchadrezzar king of babylon maketh war against us if so be thatthe lord will deal with us according to all his wondrous works thathe may go up from us then said jeremiah unto them thus shall ye say to zedekiah thus saith the lord god of israel behold i will turn back theweapons of war that are in your hands wherewith ye fight against theking of babylon and against the chaldeans which besiege you withoutthe walls and i will assemble them into the midst of this city and i myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand andwith a strong arm even in anger and in fury and in great wrath and i will smite the inhabitants of this city both man andbeast they shall die of a great pestilence and afterward saith the lord i will deliver zedekiah king ofjudah and his servants and the people and such as are left in thiscity from the pestilence from the sword and from the famine intothe hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and into the hand of theirenemies and into the hand of those that seek their life and he shallsmite them with the edge of the sword he shall not spare themneither have pity nor have mercy and unto this people thou shalt say thus saith the lord beholdi set before you the way of life and the way of death he that abideth in this city shall die by the sword and by thefamine and by the pestilence but he that goeth out and falleth tothe chaldeans that besiege you he shall live and his life shall beunto him for a prey for i have set my face against this city for evil and not forgood saith the lord it shall be given into the hand of the king ofbabylon and he shall burn it with fire and touching the house of the king of judah say hear ye theword of the lord  o house of david thus saith the lord executejudgment in the morning and deliver him that is spoiled out of thehand of the oppressor lest my fury go out like fire and burn thatnone can quench it because of the evil of your doings behold i am against thee o inhabitant of the valley and rockof the plain saith the lord which say who shall come down againstus or who shall enter into our habitations   but i will punishyou according to the fruit of your doings saith the lord and i willkindle a fire in the forest thereof and it shall devour all thingsround about it thus saith the lord go down to the house of the king of judahand speak there this word  and say hear the word of the lord oking of judah that sittest upon the throne of david thou and thyservants and thy people that enter in by these gates  thus saiththe lord execute ye judgment and righteousness and deliver thespoiled out of the hand of the oppressor and do no wrong do noviolence to the stranger the fatherless nor the widow neither shedinnocent blood in this place for if ye do this thing indeed then shall there enter in by thegates of this house kings sitting upon the throne of david riding inchariots and on horses he and his servants and his people but if ye will not hear these words i swear by myself saith thelord that this house shall become a desolation for thus saith the lord unto the kings house of judah thou artgilead unto me and the head of lebanon yet surely i will make thee awilderness and cities which are not inhabited and i will prepare destroyers against thee every one with hisweapons and they shall cut down thy choice cedars and cast them intothe fire and many nations shall pass by this city and they shall sayevery man to his neighbour wherefore hath the lord done thus untothis great city   then they shall answer because they haveforsaken the covenant of the lord their god and worshipped othergods and served them weep ye not for the dead neither bemoan him but weep sore forhim that goeth away for he shall return no more nor see his nativecountry for thus saith the lord touching shallum the son of josiah kingof judah which reigned instead of josiah his father which went forthout of this place he shall not return thither any more  but heshall die in the place whither they have led him captive and shallsee this land no more woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness and hischambers by wrong that useth his neighbours service without wagesand giveth him not for his work  that saith i will build me awide house and large chambers and cutteth him out windows and it iscieled with cedar and painted with vermilion shalt thou reign because thou closest thyself in cedar did notthy father eat and drink and do judgment and justice and then it waswell with him   he judged the cause of the poor and needy thenit was well with him was not this to know me saith the lord but thine eyes and thine heart are not but for thy covetousnessand for to shed innocent blood and for oppression and for violenceto do it therefore thus saith the lord concerning jehoiakim the son ofjosiah king of judah they shall not lament for him saying ah mybrother or ah sister they shall not lament for him saying ahlord or ah his glory   he shall be buried with the burial ofan ass drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of jerusalem go up to lebanon and cry and lift up thy voice in bashan andcry from the passages for all thy lovers are destroyed i spake unto thee in thy prosperity but thou saidst i will nothear this hath been thy manner from thy youth that thou obeyedst notmy voice the wind shall eat up all thy pastors and thy lovers shall gointo captivity surely then shalt thou be ashamed and confounded forall thy wickedness o inhabitant of lebanon that makest thy nest in the cedars howgracious shalt thou be when pangs come upon thee the pain as of awoman in travail   as i live saith the lord though coniah theson of jehoiakim king of judah were the signet upon my right hand yetwould i pluck thee thence  and i will give thee into the hand ofthem that seek thy life and into the hand of them whose face thoufearest even into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon andinto the hand of the chaldeans and i will cast thee out and thy mother that bare thee intoanother country where ye were not born and there shall ye die but to the land whereunto they desire to return thither shallthey not return is this man coniah a despised broken idol is he a vesselwherein is no pleasure wherefore are they cast out he and his seedand are cast into a land which they know not   o earth earthearth hear the word of the lord thus saith the lord write ye this man childless a man thatshall not prosper in his days for no man of his seed shall prospersitting upon the throne of david and ruling any more in judah woe be unto the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of mypasture saith the lord therefore thus saith the lord god of israel against the pastorsthat feed my people ye have scattered my flock and driven them awayand have not visited them behold i will visit upon you the evil ofyour doings saith the lord and i will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countrieswhither i have driven them and will bring them again to their foldsand they shall be fruitful and increase and i will set up shepherds over them which shall feed them andthey shall fear no more nor be dismayed neither shall they belacking saith the lord behold the days come saith the lord that i will raise untodavid a righteous branch and a king shall reign and prosper andshall execute judgment and justice in the earth in his days judah shall be saved and israel shall dwell safelyand this is his name whereby he shall be called the lord ourrighteousness therefore behold the days come saith the lord that they shallno more say the lord liveth which brought up the children of israelout of the land of egypt  but the lord liveth which brought upand which led the seed of the house of israel out of the northcountry and from all countries whither i had driven them and theyshall dwell in their own land mine heart within me is broken because of the prophets all mybones shake i am like a drunken man and like a man whom wine hathovercome because of the lord and because of the words of hisholiness for the land is full of adulterers for because of swearing theland mourneth the pleasant places of the wilderness are dried up andtheir course is evil and their force is not right for both prophet and priest are profane yea in my house have ifound their wickedness saith the lord wherefore their way shall be unto them as slippery ways in thedarkness they shall be driven on and fall therein for i will bringevil upon them even the year of their visitation saith the lord and i have seen folly in the prophets of samaria theyprophesied in baal and caused my people israel to err i have seen also in the prophets of jerusalem an horrible thingthey commit adultery and walk in lies they strengthen also the handsof evildoers that none doth return from his wickedness they are allof them unto me as sodom and the inhabitants thereof as gomorrah therefore thus saith the lord of hosts concerning the prophetsbehold i will feed them with wormwood and make them drink the waterof gall for from the prophets of jerusalem is profaneness gone forthinto all the land thus saith the lord of hosts hearken not unto the words of theprophets that prophesy unto you they make you vain they speak avision of their own heart and not out of the mouth of the lord they say still unto them that despise me the lord hath said yeshall have peace and they say unto every one that walketh after theimagination of his own heart no evil shall come upon you for who hath stood in the counsel of the lord and hathperceived and heard his word who hath marked his word and heard it behold a whirlwind of the lord is gone forth in fury even agrievous whirlwind it shall fall grievously upon the head of thewicked the anger of the lord shall not return until he have executedand till he have performed the thoughts of his heart in the latterdays ye shall consider it perfectly i have not sent these prophets yet they ran i have not spokento them yet they prophesied but if they had stood in my counsel and had caused my people tohear my words then they should have turned them from their evil wayand from the evil of their doings am i a god at hand saith the lord and not a god afar off can any hide himself in secret places that i shall not see himsaith the lord do not i fill heaven and earth saith the lord i have heard what the prophets said that prophesy lies in myname saying i have dreamed i have dreamed how long shall this be in the heart of the prophets thatprophesy lies yea they are prophets of the deceit of their ownheart  which think to cause my people to forget my name by theirdreams which they tell every man to his neighbour as their fathershave forgotten my name for baal the prophet that hath a dream let him tell a dream and he thathath my word let him speak my word faithfully what is the chaff tothe wheat saith the lord is not my word like as a fire saith the lord and like a hammerthat breaketh the rock in pieces   therefore behold i amagainst the prophets saith the lord that steal my words every onefrom his neighbour behold i am against the prophets saith the lord that usetheir tongues and say he saith behold i am against them that prophesy false dreams saith thelord and do tell them and cause my people to err by their lies andby their lightness yet i sent them not nor commanded them thereforethey shall not profit this people at all saith the lord and when this people or the prophet or a priest shall askthee saying what is the burden of the lord thou shalt then say untothem what burden i will even forsake you saith the lord and as for the prophet and the priest and the people thatshall say the burden of the lord i will even punish that man and hishouse thus shall ye say every one to his neighbour and every one tohis brother what hath the lord answered and what hath the lordspoken   and the burden of the lord shall ye mention no morefor every mans word shall be his burden for ye have perverted thewords of the living god of the lord of hosts our god thus shalt thou say to the prophet what hath the lord answeredthee and what hath the lord spoken   but since ye say theburden of the lord therefore thus saith the lord because ye say thisword the burden of the lord and i have sent unto you saying yeshall not say the burden of the lord  therefore behold ieven i will utterly forget you and i will forsake you and the citythat i gave you and your fathers and cast you out of my presence and i will bring an everlasting reproach upon you and aperpetual shame which shall not be forgotten the lord shewed me and behold two baskets of figs were setbefore the temple of the lord after that nebuchadrezzar king ofbabylon had carried away captive jeconiah the son of jehoiakim king ofjudah and the princes of judah with the carpenters and smiths fromjerusalem and had brought them to babylon one basket had very good figs even like the figs that are firstripe and the other basket had very naughty figs which could not beeaten they were so bad then said the lord unto me what seest thou jeremiah and isaid figs the good figs very good and the evil very evil thatcannot be eaten they are so evil again the word of the lord came unto me saying  thus saiththe lord the god of israel like these good figs so will iacknowledge them that are carried away captive of judah whom i havesent out of this place into the land of the chaldeans for their good for i will set mine eyes upon them for good and i will bringthem again to this land and i will build them and not pull themdown and i will plant them and not pluck them up and i will give them an heart to know me that i am the lord andthey shall be my people and i will be their god for they shallreturn unto me with their whole heart and as the evil figs which cannot be eaten they are so evilsurely thus saith the lord so will i give zedekiah the king of judahand his princes and the residue of jerusalem that remain in thisland and them that dwell in the land of egypt  and i willdeliver them to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth fortheir hurt to be a reproach and a proverb a taunt and a curse inall places whither i shall drive them and i will send the sword the famine and the pestilence amongthem till they be consumed from off the land that i gave unto themand to their fathers the word that came to jeremiah concerning all the people of judahin the fourth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah thatwas the first year of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon  the whichjeremiah the prophet spake unto all the people of judah and to allthe inhabitants of jerusalem saying  from the thirteenth year ofjosiah the son of amon king of judah even unto this day that is thethree and twentieth year the word of the lord hath come unto me andi have spoken unto you rising early and speaking but ye have nothearkened and the lord hath sent unto you all his servants the prophetsrising early and sending them but ye have not hearkened nor inclinedyour ear to hear they said turn ye again now every one from his evil way andfrom the evil of your doings and dwell in the land that the lord hathgiven unto you and to your fathers for ever and ever  and go notafter other gods to serve them and to worship them and provoke menot to anger with the works of your hands and i will do you no hurt yet ye have not hearkened unto me saith the lord that ye mightprovoke me to anger with the works of your hands to your own hurt therefore thus saith the lord of hosts because ye have not heardmy words  behold i will send and take all the families of thenorth saith the lord and nebuchadrezzar the king of babylon myservant and will bring them against this land and against theinhabitants thereof and against all these nations round about andwill utterly destroy them and make them an astonishment and anhissing and perpetual desolations moreover i will take from them the voice of mirth and the voiceof gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bridethe sound of the millstones and the light of the candle and this whole land shall be a desolation and an astonishmentand these nations shall serve the king of babylon seventy years and it shall come to pass when seventy years are accomplishedthat i will punish the king of babylon and that nation saith thelord for their iniquity and the land of the chaldeans and will makeit perpetual desolations and i will bring upon that land all my words which i havepronounced against it even all that is written in this book whichjeremiah hath prophesied against all the nations for many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of themalso and i will recompense them according to their deeds andaccording to the works of their own hands for thus saith the lord god of israel unto me take the wine cupof this fury at my hand and cause all the nations to whom i sendthee to drink it and they shall drink and be moved and be mad because of thesword that i will send

forsaken his covert as the lion for their land isdesolate because of the fierceness of the oppressor and because ofhis fierce anger in the beginning of the reign of jehoiakim the son of josiah kingof judah came this word from the lord saying  thus saith thelord stand in the court of the lords house and speak unto all thecities of judah which come to worship in the lords house all thewords that i command thee to speak unto them diminish not a word if so be they will hearken and turn every man from his evil waythat i may repent me of the evil which i purpose to do unto thembecause of the evil of their doings and thou shalt say unto them thus saith the lord if ye will nothearken to me to walk in my law which i have set before you  tohearken to the words of my servants the prophets whom i sent untoyou both rising up early and sending them but ye have nothearkened  then will i make this house like shiloh and will makethis city a curse to all the nations of the earth so the priests and the prophets and all the people heard jeremiahspeaking these words in the house of the lord now it came to pass when jeremiah had made an end of speakingall that the lord had commanded him to speak unto all the people thatthe priests and the prophets and all the people took him saying thoushalt surely die why hast thou prophesied in the name of the lord saying thishouse shall be like shiloh and this city shall be desolate without aninhabitant  and all the people were gathered against jeremiah in thehouse of the lord when the princes of judah heard these things then they came upfrom the kings house unto the house of the lord and sat down in theentry of the new gate of the lords house then spake the priests and the prophets unto the princes and toall the people saying this man is worthy to die for he hathprophesied against this city as ye have heard with your ears then spake jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the peoplesaying the lord sent me to prophesy against this house and againstthis city all the words that ye have heard therefore now amend your ways and your doings and obey thevoice of the lord your god and the lord will repent him of the evilthat he hath pronounced against you as for me behold i am in your hand do with me as seemeth goodand meet unto you but know ye for certain that if ye put me to death ye shallsurely bring innocent blood upon yourselves and upon this city andupon the inhabitants thereof for of a truth the lord hath sent meunto you to speak all these words in your ears then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and tothe prophets this man is not worthy to die for he hath spoken to usin the name of the lord our god then rose up certain of the elders of the land and spake to allthe assembly of the people saying  micah the morasthiteprophesied in the days of hezekiah king of judah and spake to all thepeople of judah saying thus saith the lord of hosts zion shall beplowed like a field and jerusalem shall become heaps and themountain of the house as the high places of a forest did hezekiah king of judah and all judah put him at all todeath  did he not fear the lord and besought the lord and the lordrepented him of the evil which he had pronounced against them thusmight we procure great evil against our souls and there was also a man that prophesied in the name of thelord urijah the son of shemaiah of kirjathjearim who prophesiedagainst this city and against this land according to all the words ofjeremiah and when jehoiakim the king with all his mighty men and allthe princes heard his words the king sought to put him to death butwhen urijah heard it he was afraid and fled and went into egypt and jehoiakim the king sent men into egypt namely elnathan theson of achbor and certain men with him into egypt and they fetched forth urijah out of egypt and brought him untojehoiakim the king who slew him with the sword and cast his deadbody into the graves of the common people nevertheless the hand of ahikam the son of shaphan was withjeremiah that they should not give him into the hand of the people toput him to death in the beginning of the reign of jehoiakim the son of josiah kingof judah came this word unto jeremiah from the lord saying  thussaith the lord to me make thee bonds and yokes and put them upon thyneck  and send them to the king of edom and to the king of moaband to the king of the ammonites and to the king of tyrus and to theking of zidon by the hand of the messengers which come to jerusalemunto zedekiah king of judah  and command them to say unto theirmasters thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel thus shallye say unto your masters  i have made the earth the man and thebeast that are upon the ground by my great power and by myoutstretched arm and have given it unto whom it seemed meet unto me and now have i given all these lands into the hand ofnebuchadnezzar the king of babylon my servant and the beasts of thefield have i given him also to serve him and all nations shall serve him and his son and his sons sonuntil the very time of his land come and then many nations and greatkings shall serve themselves of him and it shall come to pass that the nation and kingdom which willnot serve the same nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon and that willnot put their neck under the yoke of the king of babylon that nationwill i punish saith the lord with the sword and with the famineand with the pestilence until i have consumed them by his hand therefore hearken not ye to your prophets nor to your divinersnor to your dreamers nor to your enchanters nor to your sorcererswhich speak unto you saying ye shall not serve the king of babylon for they prophesy a lie unto you to remove you far from yourland and that i should drive you out and ye should perish but the nations that bring their neck under the yoke of the kingof babylon and serve him those will i let remain still in their ownland saith the lord and they shall till it and dwell therein i spake also to zedekiah king of judah according to all thesewords saying bring your necks under the yoke of the king of babylonand serve him and his people and live why will ye die thou and thy people by the sword by thefamine and by the pestilence as the lord hath spoken against thenation that will not serve the king of babylon   thereforehearken not unto the words of the prophets that speak unto yousaying ye shall not serve the king of babylon for they prophesy alie unto you for i have not sent them saith the lord yet they prophesy alie in my name that i might drive you out and that ye might perishye and the prophets that prophesy unto you also i spake to the priests and to all this people saying thussaith the lord hearken not to the words of your prophets thatprophesy unto you saying behold the vessels of the lords houseshall now shortly be brought again from babylon for they prophesy alie unto you hearken not unto them serve the king of babylon and livewherefore should this city be laid waste   but if they beprophets and if the word of the lord be with them let them now makeintercession to the lord of hosts that the vessels which are left inthe house of the lord and in the house of the king of judah and atjerusalem go not to babylon for thus saith the lord of hosts concerning the pillars andconcerning the sea and concerning the bases and concerning theresidue of the vessels that remain in this city which nebuchadnezzar king of babylon took not when he carriedaway captive jeconiah the son of jehoiakim king of judah fromjerusalem to babylon and all the nobles of judah and jerusalem yea thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel concerning thevessels that remain in the house of the lord and in the house of theking of judah and of jerusalem  they shall be carried tobabylon and there shall they be until the day that i visit themsaith the lord then will i bring them up and restore them to thisplace and it came to pass the same year in the beginning of the reignof zedekiah king of judah in the fourth year and in the fifth monththat hananiah the son of azur the prophet which was of gibeon spakeunto me in the house of the lord in the presence of the priests andof all the people saying  thus speaketh the lord of hosts thegod of israel saying i have broken the yoke of the king of babylon within two full years will i bring again into this place all thevessels of the lords house that nebuchadnezzar king of babylon tookaway from this place and carried them to babylon  and i willbring again to this place jeconiah the son of jehoiakim king of judahwith all the captives of judah that went into babylon saith thelord for i will break the yoke of the king of babylon then the prophet jeremiah said unto the prophet hananiah in thepresence of the priests and in the presence of all the people thatstood in the house of the lord  even the prophet jeremiah saidamen the lord do so the lord perform thy words which thou hastprophesied to bring again the vessels of the lords house and allthat is carried away captive from babylon into this place nevertheless hear thou now this word that i speak in thine earsand in the ears of all the people  the prophets that have beenbefore me and before thee of old prophesied both against manycountries and against great kingdoms of war and of evil and ofpestilence the prophet which prophesieth of peace when the word of theprophet shall come to pass then shall the prophet be known that thelord hath truly sent him then hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophetjeremiahs neck and brake it and hananiah spake in the presence of all the people sayingthus saith the lord even so will i break the yoke of nebuchadnezzarking of babylon from the neck of all nations within the space of twofull years and the prophet jeremiah went his way then the word of the lord came unto jeremiah the prophet afterthat hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off the neck of theprophet jeremiah saying  go and tell hananiah saying thussaith the lord thou hast broken the yokes of wood but thou shaltmake for them yokes of iron for thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel i have puta yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations that they may servenebuchadnezzar king of babylon and they shall serve him and i havegiven him the beasts of the field also then said the prophet jeremiah unto hananiah the prophet hearnow hananiah the lord hath not sent thee but thou makest thispeople to trust in a lie therefore thus saith the lord behold i will cast thee from offthe face of the earth this year thou shalt die because thou hasttaught rebellion against the lord so hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month now these are the words of the letter that jeremiah the prophetsent from jerusalem unto the residue of the elders which were carriedaway captives and to the priests and to the prophets and to all thepeople whom nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from jerusalem tobabylon  after that jeconiah the king and the queen and theeunuchs the princes of judah and jerusalem and the carpenters andthe smiths were departed from jerusalem  by the hand of elasahthe son of shaphan and gemariah the son of hilkiah whom zedekiahking of judah sent unto babylon to nebuchadnezzar king of babylonsaying  thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel unto allthat are carried away captives whom i have caused to be carried awayfrom jerusalem unto babylon  build ye houses and dwell in themand plant gardens and eat the fruit of them  take ye wives andbeget sons and daughters and take wives for your sons and give yourdaughters to husbands that they may bear sons and daughters that yemay be increased there and not diminished and seek the peace of the city whither i have caused you to becarried away captives and pray unto the lord for it for in the peacethereof shall ye have peace for thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel let not yourprophets and your diviners that be in the midst of you deceive youneither hearken to your dreams which ye cause to be dreamed for they prophesy falsely unto you in my name i have not sentthem saith the lord for thus saith the lord that after seventy years beaccomplished at babylon i will visit you and perform my good wordtoward you in causing you to return to this place for i know the thoughts that i think toward you saith the lordthoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end then shall ye call upon me and ye shall go and pray unto meand i will hearken unto you and ye shall seek me and find me when ye shall search for mewith all your heart and i will be found of you saith the lord and i will turn awayyour captivity and i will gather you from all the nations and fromall the places whither i have driven you saith the lord and i willbring you again into the place whence i caused you to be carried awaycaptive because ye have said the lord hath raised us up prophets inbabylon  know that thus saith the lord of the king that sittethupon the throne of david and of all the people that dwelleth in thiscity and of your brethren that are not gone forth with you intocaptivity  thus saith the lord of hosts behold i will sendupon them the sword the famine and the pestilence and will makethem like vile figs that cannot be eaten they are so evil and i will persecute them with the sword with the famine andwith the pestilence and will deliver them to be removed to all thekingdoms of the earth to be a curse and an astonishment and anhissing and a reproach among all the nations whither i have driventhem  because they have not hearkened to my words saith thelord which i sent unto them by my servants the prophets rising upearly and sending them but ye would not hear saith the lord hear ye therefore the word of the lord all ye of the captivitywhom i have sent from jerusalem to babylon  thus saith the lordof hosts the god of israel of ahab the son of kolaiah and ofzedekiah the son of maaseiah which prophesy a lie unto you in myname behold i will deliver them into the hand of nebuchadrezzar kingof babylon and he shall slay them before your eyes  and of themshall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of judah which are inbabylon saying the lord make thee like zedekiah and like ahab whomthe king of babylon roasted in the fire  because they havecommitted villany in israel and have committed adultery with theirneighbours wives and have spoken lying words in my name which ihave not commanded them even i know and am a witness saith thelord thus shalt thou also speak to shemaiah the nehelamite saying thus speaketh the lord of hosts the god of israel sayingbecause thou hast sent letters in thy name unto all the people thatare at jerusalem and to zephaniah the son of maaseiah the priest andto all the priests saying  the lord hath made thee priest inthe stead of jehoiada the priest that ye should be officers in thehouse of the lord for every man that is mad and maketh himself aprophet that thou shouldest put him in prison and in the stocks now therefore why hast thou not reproved jeremiah of anathothwhich maketh himself a prophet to you   for therefore he sentunto us in babylon saying this captivity is long build ye housesand dwell in them and plant gardens and eat the fruit of them and zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears ofjeremiah the prophet then came the word of the lord unto jeremiah saying  sendto all them of the captivity saying thus saith the lord concerningshemaiah the nehelamite because that shemaiah hath prophesied untoyou and i sent him not and he caused you to trust in a lie therefore thus saith the lord behold i will punish shemaiah thenehelamite and his seed he shall not have a man to dwell among thispeople neither shall he behold the good that i will do for my peoplesaith the lord because he hath taught rebellion against the lord the word that came to jeremiah from the lord saying  thusspeaketh the lord god of israel saying write thee all the words thati have spoken unto thee in a book for lo the days come saith the lord that i will bring againthe captivity of my people israel and judah saith the lord and iwill cause them to return to the land that i gave to their fathersand they shall possess it and these are the words that the lord spake concerning israel andconcerning judah for thus saith the lord we have heard a voice of trembling offear and not of peace ask ye now and see whether a man doth travail with childwherefore do i see every man with his hands on his loins as a womanin travail and all faces are turned into paleness   alas forthat day is great so that none is like it it is even the time ofjacobs trouble but he shall be saved out of it for it shall come to pass in that day saith the lord of hoststhat i will break his yoke from off thy neck and will burst thybonds and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him  butthey shall serve the lord their god and david their king whom i willraise up unto them therefore fear thou not o my servant jacob saith the lordneither be dismayed o israel for lo i will save thee from afarand thy seed from the land of their captivity and jacob shall returnand shall be in rest and be quiet and none shall make him afraid for i am with thee saith the lord to save thee though i makea full end of all nations whither i have scattered thee yet i willnot make a full end of thee but i will correct thee in measure andwill not leave thee altogether unpunished for thus saith the lord thy bruise is incurable and thy woundis grievous there is none to plead thy cause that thou mayest be bound upthou hast no healing medicines all thy lovers have forgotten thee they seek thee not for ihave wounded thee with the wound of an enemy with the chastisement ofa cruel one for the multitude of thine iniquity because thy sinswere increased why criest thou for thine affliction thy sorrow is incurablefor the multitude of thine iniquity because thy sins were increasedi have done these things unto thee therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured and allthine adversaries every one of them shall go into captivity andthey that spoil thee shall be a spoil and all that prey upon theewill i give for a prey for i will restore health unto thee and i will heal thee of thywounds saith the lord because they called thee an outcast sayingthis is zion whom no man seeketh after thus saith the lord behold i will bring again the captivity ofjacobs tents and have mercy on his dwellingplaces and the cityshall be builded upon her own heap and the palace shall remain afterthe manner thereof and out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of themthat make merry and i will multiply them and they shall not be fewi will also glorify them and they shall not be small their children also shall be as aforetime and theircongregation shall be established before me and i will punish allthat oppress them and their nobles shall be of themselves and their governorshall proceed from the midst of them and i will cause him to drawnear and he shall approach unto me for who is this that engaged hisheart to approach unto me saith the lord and ye shall be my people and i will be your god behold the whirlwind of the lord goeth forth with fury acontinuing whirlwind it shall fall with pain upon the head of thewicked the fierce anger of the lord shall not return until he hathdone it and until he have performed the intents of his heart in thelatter days ye shall consider it at the same time saith the lord will i be the god of all thefamilies of israel and they shall be my people thus saith the lord the people which were left of the swordfound grace in the wilderness even israel when i went to cause himto rest the lord hath appeared of old unto me saying yea i have lovedthee with an everlasting love therefore with lovingkindness have idrawn thee again i will build thee and thou shalt be built o virgin ofisrael thou shalt again be adorned with thy tabrets and shalt goforth in the dances of them that make merry thou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of samaria theplanters shall plant and shall eat them as common things for there shall be a day that the watchmen upon the mountephraim shall cry arise ye and let us go up to zion unto the lordour god for thus saith the lord sing with gladness for jacob and shoutamong the chief of the nations publish ye praise ye and say olord save thy people the remnant of israel behold i will bring them from the north country and gather themfrom the coasts of the earth and with them the blind and the lamethe woman with child and her that travaileth with child together agreat company shall return thither they shall come with weeping and with supplications will i leadthem i will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters in a straightway wherein they shall not stumble for i am a father to israel andephraim is my firstborn hear the word of the lord o ye nations and declare it in theisles afar off and say he that scattered israel will gather him andkeep him as a shepherd doth his flock for the lord hath redeemed jacob and ransomed him from the handof him that was stronger than he therefore they shall come and sing in the height of zion andshall flow together to the goodness of the lord for wheat and forwine and for oil and for the young of the flock and of the herd andtheir soul shall be as a watered garden and they shall not sorrow anymore at all then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance both young men andold together for i will turn their mourning into joy and willcomfort them and make them rejoice from their sorrow and i will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness and mypeople shall be satisfied with my goodness saith the lord thus saith the lord a voice was heard in ramah lamentationand bitter weeping rahel weeping for her children refused to becomforted for her children because they were not thus saith the lord refrain thy voice from weeping and thineeyes from tears for thy work shall be rewarded saith the lord andthey shall come again from the land of the enemy and there is hope in thine end saith the lord that thychildren shall come again to their own border i have surely heard ephraim bemoaning himself thus thou hastchastised me and i was chastised as a bullock unaccustomed to theyoke turn thou me and i shall be turned for thou art the lord mygod surely after that i was turned i repented and after that i wasinstructed i smote upon my thigh i was ashamed yea evenconfounded because i did bear the reproach of my youth is ephraim my dear son is he a pleasant child for since ispake against him i do earnestly remember him still therefore mybowels are troubled for him i will surely have mercy upon him saiththe lord set thee up waymarks make thee high heaps set thine hearttoward the highway even the way which thou wentest turn again ovirgin of israel turn again to these thy cities how long wilt thou go about o thou backsliding daughter forthe lord hath created a new thing in the earth a woman shall compassa man thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel as yet theyshall use this speech in the land of judah and in the cities thereofwhen i shall bring again their captivity the lord bless thee ohabitation of justice and mountain of holiness and there shall dwell in judah itself and in all the citiesthereof together husbandmen and they that go forth with flocks for i have satiated the weary soul and i have replenished everysorrowful soul upon this i awaked and beheld and my sleep was sweet unto me behold the days come saith the lord that i will sow the houseof israel and the house of judah with the seed of man and with theseed of beast and it shall come to pass that like as i have watched overthem to pluck up and to break down and to throw down and todestroy and to afflict so will i watch over them to build and toplant saith the lord in those days they shall say no more the fathers have eaten asour grape and the childrens teeth are set on edge but every one shall die for his own iniquity every man thateateth the sour grape his teeth shall be set on edge behold the days come saith the lord that i will make a newcovenant with the house of israel and with the house of judah not according to the covenant that i made with their fathers in theday that i took them by the hand to bring them out of the land ofegypt which my covenant they brake although i was an husband untothem saith the lord  but this shall be the covenant that i willmake with the house of israel after those days saith the lord iwill put my law in their inward parts and write it in their heartsand will be their god and they shall be my people and they shall teach no more every man his neighbour and everyman his brother saying know the lord for they shall all know mefrom the least of them unto the greatest of them saith the lord fori will forgive their iniquity and i will remember their sin no more thus saith the lord which giveth the sun for a light by dayand the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by nightwhich divideth the sea when the waves thereof roar the lord of hostsis his name  if those ordinances depart from before me saiththe lord then the seed of israel also shall cease from being a nationbefore me for ever thus saith the lord if heaven above can be measured and thefoundations of the earth searched out beneath i will also cast offall the seed of israel for all that they have done saith the lord behold the days come saith the lord that the city shall bebuilt to the lord from the tower of hananeel unto the gate of thecorner and the measuring line shall yet go forth over against it uponthe hill gareb and shall compass about to goath and the whole valley of the dead bodies and of the ashes andall the fields unto the brook of kidron unto the corner of the horsegate toward the east shall be holy unto the lord it shall not beplucked up nor thrown down any more for ever the word that came to jeremiah from the lord in the tenth year ofzedekiah king of judah which was the eighteenth year ofnebuchadrezzar for then the king of babylons army besieged jerusalem andjeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison which wasin the king of judahs house for zedekiah king of judah had shut him up saying whereforedost thou prophesy and say thus saith the lord behold i will givethis city into the hand of the king of babylon and he shall take it and zedekiah king of judah shall not escape out of the hand ofthe chaldeans but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the kingof babylon and shall speak with him mouth to mouth and his eyesshall behold his eyes  and he shall lead zedekiah to babylon andthere shall he be until i visit him saith the lord though ye fightwith the chaldeans ye shall not prosper and jeremiah said the word of the lord came unto me saying behold hanameel the son of shallum thine uncle shall come untothee saying buy thee my field that is in anathoth for the right ofredemption is thine to buy it so hanameel mine uncles son came to me in the court of theprison according to the word of the lord and said unto me buy myfield i pray thee that is in anathoth which is in the country ofbenjamin for the right of inheritance is thine and the redemption isthine buy it for thyselfthen i knew that this was the word of the lord and i bought the field of hanameel my uncles son that was inanathoth and weighed him the money even seventeen shekels of silver and i subscribed the evidence and sealed it and tookwitnesses and weighed him the money in the balances so i took the evidence of the purchase both that which wassealed according to the law and custom and that which was open and i gave the evidence of the purchase unto baruch the son of neriahthe son of maaseiah in the sight of hanameel mine uncles son and inthe presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of thepurchase before all the jews that sat in the court of the prison and i charged baruch before them saying  thus saith thelord of hosts the god of israel take these evidences this evidenceof the purchase both which is sealed and this evidence which isopen and put them in an earthen vessel that they may continue manydays for thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel houses andfields and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land now when i had delivered the evidence of the purchase untobaruch the son of neriah i prayed unto the lord saying  ahlord god behold thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy greatpower and stretched out arm and there is nothing too hard for thee thou shewest lovingkindness unto thousands and recompensest theiniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after themthe great the mighty god the lord of hosts is his name  greatin counsel and mighty in work for thine eyes are open upon all theways of the sons of men to give every one according to his ways andaccording to the fruit of his doings  which hast set signs andwonders in the land of egypt even unto this day and in israel andamong other men and hast made thee a name as at this day  andhast brought forth thy people israel out of the land of egypt withsigns and with wonders and with a strong hand and with a stretchedout arm and with great terror  and hast given them this landwhich thou didst swear to their fathers to give them a land flowingwith milk and honey  and they came in and possessed it butthey obeyed not thy voice neither walked in thy law they have donenothing of all that thou commandedst them to do therefore thou hastcaused all this evil to come upon them  behold the mounts theyare come unto the city to take it and the city is given into the handof the chaldeans that fight against it because of the sword and ofthe famine and of the pestilence and what thou hast spoken is cometo pass and behold thou seest it and thou hast said unto me o lord god buy thee the field formoney and take witnesses for the city is given into the hand of thechaldeans then came the word of the lord unto jeremiah saying behold i am the lord the god of all flesh is there any thing toohard for me   therefore thus saith the lord behold i will givethis city into the hand of the chaldeans and into the hand ofnebuchadrezzar king of babylon and he shall take it  and thechaldeans that fight against this city shall come and set fire onthis city and burn it with the houses upon whose roofs they haveoffered incense unto baal and poured out drink offerings unto othergods to provoke me to anger for the children of israel and the children of judah have onlydone evil before me from their youth for the children of israel haveonly provoked me to anger with the work of their hands saith thelord for this city hath been to me as a provocation of mine anger andof my fury from the day that they built it even unto this day that ishould remove it from before my face  because of all the evil ofthe children of israel and of the children of judah which they havedone to provoke me to anger they their kings their princes theirpriests and their prophets and the men of judah and the inhabitantsof jerusalem and they have turned unto me the back and not the face thoughi taught them rising up early and teaching them yet they have nothearkened to receive instruction but they set their abominations in the house which is called bymy name to defile it and they built the high places of baal which are in the valleyof the son of hinnom to cause their sons and their daughters to passthrough the fire unto molech which i commanded them not neither cameit into my mind that they should do this abomination to cause judahto sin and now therefore thus saith the lord the god of israelconcerning this city whereof ye say it shall be delivered into thehand of the king of babylon by the sword and by the famine and bythe pestilence  behold i will gather them out of all countrieswhither i have driven them in mine anger and in my fury and in greatwrath and i will bring them again unto this place and i will causethem to dwell safely  and they shall be my people and i will betheir god  and i will give them one heart and one way thatthey may fear me for ever for the good of them and of their childrenafter them  and i will make an everlasting covenant with themthat i will not turn away from them to do them good but i will putmy fear in their hearts that they shall not depart from me yea i will rejoice over them to do them good and i will plantthem in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my wholesoul for thus saith the lord like as i have brought all this greatevil upon this people so will i bring upon them all the good that ihave promised them and fields shall be bought in this land whereof ye say it isdesolate without man or beast it is given into the hand of thechaldeans men shall buy fields for money and subscribe evidences andseal them and take witnesses in the land of benjamin and in theplaces about jerusalem and in the cities of judah and in the citiesof the mountains and in the cities of the valley and in the citiesof the south for i will cause their captivity to return saith thelord moreover the word of the lord came unto jeremiah the second timewhile he was yet shut up in the court of the prison saying  thussaith the lord the maker thereof the lord that formed it toestablish it the lord is his name  call unto me and i willanswer thee and shew thee great and mighty things which thou knowestnot for thus saith the lord the god of israel concerning the housesof this city and concerning the houses of the kings of judah whichare thrown down by the mounts and by the sword  they come tofight with the chaldeans but it is to fill them with the dead bodiesof men whom i have slain in mine anger and in my fury and for allwhose wickedness i have hid my face from this city behold i will bring it health and cure and i will cure themand will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth and i will cause the captivity of judah and the captivity ofisrael to return and will build them as at the first and i will cleanse them from all their iniquity whereby theyhave sinned against me and i will pardon all their iniquitieswhereby they have sinned and whereby they have transgressed againstme and it shall be to me a name of joy a praise and an honourbefore all the nations of the earth which shall hear all the goodthat i do unto them and they shall fear and tremble for all thegoodness and for all the prosperity that i procure unto it thus saith the lord again there shall be heard in this placewhich ye say shall be desolate without man and without beast even inthe cities of judah and in the streets of jerusalem that aredesolate without man and without inhabitant and without beast the voice of joy and the voice of gladness the voice of thebridegroom and the voice of the bride the voice of them that shallsay praise the lord of hosts for the lord is good for his mercyendureth for ever and of them that shall bring the sacrifice ofpraise into the house of the lord for i will cause to return thecaptivity of the land as at the first saith the lord thus saith the lord of hosts again in this place which isdesolate without man and without beast and in all the cities thereofshall be an habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down in the cities of the mountains in the cities of the vale andin the cities of the south and in the land of benjamin and in theplaces about jerusalem and in the cities of judah shall the flockspass again under the hands of him that telleth them saith the lord behold the days come saith the lord that i will perform thatgood thing which i have promised unto the house of israel and to thehouse of judah in those days and at that time will i cause the branch ofrighteousness to grow up unto david and he shall execute judgment andrighteousness in the land in those days shall judah be saved and jerusalem shall dwellsafely and this is the name wherewith she shall be called the lordour righteousness for thus saith the lord david shall never want a man to situpon the throne of the house of israel  neither shall thepriests the levites want a man before me to offer burnt offerings andto kindle meat offerings and to do sacrifice continually and the word of the lord came unto jeremiah saying  thussaith the lord if ye can break my covenant of the day and mycovenant of the night and that there should not be day and night intheir season  then may also my covenant be broken with david myservant that he should not have a son to reign upon his throne andwith the levites the priests my ministers as the host of heaven cannot be numbered neither the sand ofthe sea measured so will i multiply the seed of david my servant andthe levites that minister unto me moreover the word of the lord came to jeremiah saying considerest thou not what this people have spoken saying the twofamilies which the lord hath chosen he hath even cast them off thusthey have despised my people that they should be no more a nationbefore them thus saith the lord if my covenant be not with day and nightand if i have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth then will i cast away the seed of jacob and david my servant so thati will not take any of his seed to be rulers over the seed of abrahamisaac and jacob for i will cause their captivity to return and havemercy on them the word which came unto jeremiah from the lord whennebuchadnezzar king of babylon and all his army and all the kingdomsof the earth of his dominion and all the people fought againstjerusalem and against all the cities thereof saying  thus saiththe lord the god of israel go and speak to zedekiah king of judahand tell him thus saith the lord behold i will give this city intothe hand of the king of babylon and he shall burn it with fire and thou shalt not escape out of his hand but shalt surely be takenand delivered into his hand and thine eyes shall behold the eyes ofthe king of babylon and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth andthou shalt go to babylon yet hear the word of the lord o zedekiah king of judah thussaith the lord of thee thou shalt not die by the sword  but thoushalt die in peace and with the burnings of thy fathers the formerkings which were before thee so shall they burn odours for thee andthey will lament thee saying ah lord for i have pronounced theword saith the lord then jeremiah the prophet spake all these words unto zedekiahking of judah in jerusalem  when the king of babylons armyfought against jerusalem and against all the cities of judah thatwere left against lachish and against azekah for these defencedcities remained of the cities of judah this is the word that came unto jeremiah from the lord afterthat the king zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people whichwere at jerusalem to proclaim liberty unto them  that every manshould let his manservant and every man his maidservant being anhebrew or an hebrewess go free that none should serve himself ofthem to wit of a jew his brother now when all the princes and all the people which had enteredinto the covenant heard that every one should let his manservant andevery one his maidservant go free that none should serve themselvesof them any more then they obeyed and let them go but afterward they turned and caused the servants and thehandmaids whom they had let go free to return and brought them intosubjection for servants and for handmaids therefore the word of the lord came to jeremiah from the lordsaying  thus saith the lord the god of israel i made acovenant with your fathers in the day that i brought them forth out ofthe land of egypt out of the house of bondmen saying  at theend of seven years let ye go every man his brother an hebrew whichhath been sold unto thee and when he hath served thee six years thoushalt let him go free from thee but your fathers hearkened not untome neither inclined their ear and ye were now turned and had done right in my sight inproclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour and ye had made acovenant before me in the house which is called by my name  butye turned and polluted my name and caused every man his servant andevery man his handmaid whom ye had set at liberty at their pleasureto return and brought them into subjection to be unto you forservants and for handmaids therefore thus saith the lord ye have not hearkened unto me inproclaiming liberty every one to his brother and every man to hisneighbour behold i proclaim a liberty for you saith the lord tothe sword to the pestilence and to the famine and i will make youto be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth and i will give the men that have transgressed my covenantwhich have not performed the words of the covenant which they had madebefore me when they cut the calf in twain and passed between theparts thereof  the princes of judah and the princes ofjerusalem the eunuchs and the priests and all the people of theland which passed between the parts of the calf  i will evengive them into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of themthat seek their life and their dead bodies shall be for meat unto thefowls of the heaven and to the beasts of the earth and zedekiah king of judah and his princes will i give into thehand of their enemies and into the hand of them that seek their lifeand into the hand of the king of babylons army which are gone upfrom you behold i will command saith the lord and cause them to returnto this city and they shall fight against it and take it and burnit with fire and i will make the cities of judah a desolation withoutan inhabitant the word which came unto jeremiah from the lord in the days ofjehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah saying  go unto thehouse of the rechabites and speak unto them and bring them into thehouse of the lord into one of the chambers and give them wine todrink then i took jaazaniah the son of jeremiah the son of habaziniahand his brethren and all his sons and the whole house of therechabites  and i brought them into the house of the lord intothe chamber of the sons of hanan the son of igdaliah a man of godwhich was by the chamber of the princes which was above the chamberof maaseiah the son of shallum the keeper of the door  and i setbefore the sons of the house of the rechabites pots full of wine andcups and i said unto them drink ye wine but they said we will drink no wine for jonadab the son ofrechab our father commanded us saying ye shall drink no wineneither ye nor your sons for ever  neither shall ye build housenor sow seed nor plant vineyard nor have any but all your days yeshall dwell in tents that ye may live many days in the land where yebe strangers thus have we obeyed the voice of jonadab the son of rechab ourfather in all that he hath charged us to drink no wine all our dayswe our wives our sons nor our daughters  nor to build housesfor us to dwell in neither have we vineyard nor field nor seed but we have dwelt in tents and have obeyed and done accordingto all that jonadab our father commanded us but it came to pass when nebuchadrezzar king of babylon came upinto the land that we said come and let us go to jerusalem for fearof the army of the chaldeans and for fear of the army of the syriansso we dwell at jerusalem then came the word of the lord unto jeremiah saying  thussaith the lord of hosts the god of israel go and tell the men ofjudah and the inhabitants of jerusalem will ye not receiveinstruction to hearken to my words saith the lord the words of jonadab the son of rechab that he commanded hissons not to drink wine are performed for unto this day they drinknone but obey their fathers commandment notwithstanding i havespoken unto you rising early and speaking but ye hearkened not untome i have sent also unto you all my servants the prophets risingup early and sending them saying return ye now every man from hisevil way and amend your doings and go not after other gods to servethem and ye shall dwell in the land which i have given to you and toyour fathers but ye have not inclined your ear nor hearkened untome because the sons of jonadab the son of rechab have performed thecommandment of their father which he commanded them but this peoplehath not hearkened unto me  therefore thus saith the lord god ofhosts the god of israel behold i will bring upon judah and upon allthe inhabitants of jerusalem all the evil that i have pronouncedagainst them because i have spoken unto them but they have notheard and i have called unto them but they have not answered and jeremiah said unto the house of the rechabites thus saiththe lord of hosts the god of israel because ye have obeyed thecommandment of jonadab your father and kept all his precepts anddone according unto all that he hath commanded you  thereforethus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel jonadab the son ofrechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever and it came to pass in the fourth year of jehoiakim the son ofjosiah king of judah that this word came unto jeremiah from the lordsaying  take thee a roll of a book and write therein all thewords that i have spoken unto thee against israel and against judahand against all the nations from the day i spake unto thee from thedays of josiah even unto this day it may be that the house of judah will hear all the evil which ipurpose to do unto them that they may return every man from his evilway that i may forgive their iniquity and their sin then jeremiah called baruch the son of neriah and baruch wrotefrom the mouth of jeremiah all the words of the lord which he hadspoken unto him upon a roll of a book and jeremiah commanded baruch saying i am shut up i cannot gointo the house of the lord  therefore go thou and read in theroll which thou hast written from my mouth the words of the lord inthe ears of the people in the lords house upon the fasting day andalso thou shalt read them in the ears of all judah that come out oftheir cities it may be they will present their supplication before the lordand will return every one from his evil way for great is the angerand the fury that the lord hath pronounced against this people and baruch the son of neriah did according to all that jeremiahthe prophet commanded him reading in the book the words of the lordin the lords house and it came to pass in the fifth year of jehoiakim the son ofjosiah king of judah in the ninth month that they proclaimed a fastbefore the lord to all the people in jerusalem and to all the peoplethat came from the cities of judah unto jerusalem then read baruch in the book the words of jeremiah in the houseof the lord in the chamber of gemariah the son of shaphan the scribein the higher court at the entry of the new gate of the lords housein the ears of all the people when michaiah the son of gemariah the son of shaphan had heardout of the book all the words of the lord  then he went downinto the kings house into the scribes chamber and lo all theprinces sat there even elishama the scribe and delaiah the son ofshemaiah and elnathan the son of achbor and gemariah the son ofshaphan and zedekiah the son of hananiah and all the princes then michaiah declared unto them all the words that he hadheard when baruch read the book in the ears of the people therefore all the princes sent jehudi the son of nethaniah theson of shelemiah the son of cushi unto baruch saying take in thinehand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ears of the people andcome so baruch the son of neriah took the roll in his hand and cameunto them and they said unto him sit down now and read it in our earsso baruch read it in their ears now it came to pass when they had heard all the words theywere afraid both one and other and said unto baruch we will surelytell the king of all these words and they asked baruch saying tell us now how didst thou writeall these words at his mouth   then baruch answered them hepronounced all these words unto me with his mouth and i wrote themwith ink in the book then said the princes unto baruch go hide thee thou andjeremiah and let no man know where ye be and they went in to the king into the court but they laid upthe roll in the chamber of elishama the scribe and told all the wordsin the ears of the king so the king sent jehudi to fetch the roll and he took it out ofelishama the scribes chamber and jehudi read it in the ears of theking and in the ears of all the princes which stood beside the king now the king sat in the winterhouse in the ninth month andthere was a fire on the hearth burning before him and it came to pass that when jehudi had read three or fourleaves he cut it with the penknife and cast it into the fire thatwas on the hearth until all the roll was consumed in the fire thatwas on the hearth yet they were not afraid nor rent their garments neither theking nor any of his servants that heard all these words nevertheless elnathan and delaiah and gemariah had madeintercession to the king that he would not burn the roll but he wouldnot hear them but the king commanded jerahmeel the son of hammelech andseraiah the son of azriel and shelemiah the son of abdeel to takebaruch the scribe and jeremiah the prophet but the lord hid them then the word of the lord came to jeremiah after that the kinghad burned the roll and the words which baruch wrote at the mouth ofjeremiah saying  take thee again another roll and write in itall the former words that were in the first roll which jehoiakim theking of judah hath burned and thou shalt say to jehoiakim king of judah thus saith thelord thou hast burned this roll saying why hast thou writtentherein saying the king of babylon shall certainly come and destroythis land and shall cause to cease from thence man and beast  therefore thus saith the lord of jehoiakim king of judah he shallhave none to sit upon the throne of david and his dead body shall becast out in the day to the heat and in the night to the frost and i will punish him and his seed and his servants for theiriniquity and i will bring upon them and upon the inhabitants ofjerusalem and upon the men of judah all the evil that i havepronounced against them but they hearkened not then took jeremiah another roll and gave it to baruch thescribe the son of neriah who wrote therein from the mouth ofjeremiah all the words of the book which jehoiakim king of judah hadburned in the fire and there were added besides unto them many likewords and king zedekiah the son of josiah reigned instead of coniah theson of jehoiakim whom nebuchadrezzar king of babylon made king in theland of judah but neither he nor his servants nor the people of the land didhearken unto the words of the lord which he spake by the prophetjeremiah and zedekiah the king sent jehucal the son of shelemiah andzephaniah the son of maaseiah the priest to the prophet jeremiahsaying pray now unto the lord our god for us now jeremiah came in and went out among the people for they hadnot put him into prison then pharaohs army was come forth out of egypt and when thechaldeans that besieged jerusalem heard tidings of them they departedfrom jerusalem then came the word of the lord unto the prophet jeremiah saying thus saith the lord the god of israel thus shall ye say to theking of judah that sent you unto me to enquire of me beholdpharaohs army which is come forth to help you shall return to egyptinto their own land and the chaldeans shall come again and fight against this cityand take it and burn it with fire thus saith the lord deceive not yourselves saying thechaldeans shall surely depart from us for they shall not depart for though ye had smitten the whole army of the chaldeans thatfight against you and there remained but wounded men among them yetshould they rise up every man in his tent and burn this city withfire and it came to pass that when the army of the chaldeans wasbroken up from jerusalem for fear of pharaohs army  thenjeremiah went forth out of jerusalem to go into the land of benjaminto separate himself thence in the midst of the people and when he was in the gate of benjamin a captain of the wardwas there whose name was irijah the son of shelemiah the son ofhananiah and he took jeremiah the prophet saying thou fallest awayto the chaldeans then said jeremiah it is false i fall not away to thechaldeansbut he hearkened not to him so irijah took jeremiah and brought himto the princes wherefore the princes were wroth with jeremiah and smote himand put him in prison in the house of jonathan the scribe for theyhad made that the prison when jeremiah was entered into the dungeon and into the cabinsand jeremiah had remained there many days  then zedekiah theking sent and took him out and the king asked him secretly in hishouse and said is there any word from the lord and jeremiah saidthere is for said he thou shalt be delivered into the hand of theking of babylon moreover jeremiah said unto king zedekiah what have i offendedagainst thee or against thy servants or against this people that yehave put me in prison   where are now your prophets whichprophesied unto you saying the king of babylon shall not comeagainst you nor against this land   therefore hear now i praythee o my lord the king let my supplication i pray thee beaccepted before thee that thou cause me not to return to the house ofjonathan the scribe lest i die there then zedekiah the king commanded that they should commitjeremiah into the court of the prison and that they should give himdaily a piece of bread out of the bakers street until all the breadin the city were spentthus jeremiah remained in the court of the prison then shephatiah the son of mattan and gedaliah the son ofpashur and jucal the son of shelemiah and pashur the son ofmalchiah heard the words that jeremiah had spoken unto all thepeople saying  thus saith the lord he that remaineth in thiscity shall die by the sword by the famine and by the pestilence buthe that goeth forth to the chaldeans shall live for he shall have hislife for a prey and shall live thus saith the lord this city shall surely be given into thehand of the king of babylons army which shall take it therefore the princes said unto the king we beseech thee letthis man be put to death for thus he weakeneth the hands of the menof war that remain in this city and the hands of all the people inspeaking such words unto them for this man seeketh not the welfare ofthis people but the hurt then zedekiah the king said behold he is in your hand for theking is not he that can do any thing against you then took they jeremiah and cast him into the dungeon ofmalchiah the son of hammelech that was in the court of the prisonand they let down jeremiah with cords and in the dungeon there was nowater but mire so jeremiah sunk in the mire now when ebedmelech the ethiopian one of the eunuchs which wasin the kings house heard that they had put jeremiah in the dungeonthe king then sitting in the gate of benjamin  ebedmelech wentforth out of the kings house and spake to the king saying  mylord the king these men have done evil in all that they have done tojeremiah the prophet whom they have cast into the dungeon and he islike to die for hunger in the place where he is for there is no morebread in the city then the king commanded ebedmelech the ethiopian saying takefrom hence thirty men with thee and take up jeremiah the prophet outof the dungeon before he die so ebedmelech took the men with him and went into the house ofthe king under the treasury and took thence old cast clouts and oldrotten rags and let them down by cords into the dungeon to jeremiah and ebedmelech the ethiopian said unto jeremiah put now theseold cast clouts and rotten rags under thine armholes under the cordsand jeremiah did so so they drew up jeremiah with cords and took him up out of thedungeon and jeremiah remained in the court of the prison then zedekiah the king sent and took jeremiah the prophet untohim into the third entry that is in the house of the lord and theking said unto jeremiah i will ask thee a thing hide nothing fromme then jeremiah said unto zedekiah if i declare it unto theewilt thou not surely put me to death and if i give thee counsel wiltthou not hearken unto me   so zedekiah the king sware secretlyunto jeremiah saying as the lord liveth that made us this soul iwill not put thee to death neither will i give thee into the hand ofthese men that seek thy life then said jeremiah unto zedekiah thus saith the lord the godof hosts the god of israel if thou wilt assuredly go forth unto theking of babylons princes then thy soul shall live and this cityshall not be burned with fire and thou shalt live and thine house but if thou wilt not go forth to the king of babylons princesthen shall this city be given into the hand of the chaldeans and theyshall burn it with fire and thou shalt not escape out of their hand and zedekiah the king said unto jeremiah i am afraid of thejews that are fallen to the chaldeans lest they deliver me into theirhand and they mock me but jeremiah said they shall not deliver thee obey i beseechthee the voice of the lord which i speak unto thee so it shall bewell unto thee and thy soul shall live but if thou refuse to go forth this is the word that the lordhath shewed me  and behold all the women that are left in theking of judahs house shall be brought forth to the king of babylonsprinces and those women shall say thy friends have set thee on andhave prevailed against thee thy feet are sunk in the mire and theyare turned away back so they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to thechaldeans and thou shalt not escape out of their hand but shalt betaken by the hand of the king of babylon and thou shalt cause thiscity to be burned with fire then said zedekiah unto jeremiah let no man know of thesewords and thou shalt not die but if the princes hear that i have talked with thee and theycome unto thee and say unto thee declare unto us now what thou hastsaid unto the king hide it not from us and we will not put thee todeath also what the king said unto thee  then thou shalt sayunto them i presented my supplication before the king that he wouldnot cause me to return to jonathans house to die there then came all the princes unto jeremiah and asked him and hetold them according to all these words that the king had commanded sothey left off speaking with him for the matter was not perceived so jeremiah abode in the court of the prison until the day thatjerusalem was taken and he was there when jerusalem was taken in the ninth year of zedekiah king of judah in the tenth monthcame nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and all his army againstjerusalem and they besieged it and in the eleventh year of zedekiah in the fourth month theninth day of the month the city was broken up and all the princes of the king of babylon came in and sat inthe middle gate even nergalsharezer samgarnebo sarsechim rabsarisnergalsharezer rabmag with all the residue of the princes of theking of babylon and it came to pass that when zedekiah the king of judah sawthem and all the men of war then they fled and went forth out ofthe city by night by the way of the kings garden by the gatebetwixt the two walls and he went out the way of the plain but the chaldeans army pursued after them and overtook zedekiahin the plains of jericho and when they had taken him they broughthim up to nebuchadnezzar king of babylon to riblah in the land ofhamath where he gave judgment upon him then the king of babylon slew the sons of zedekiah in riblahbefore his eyes also the king of babylon slew all the nobles ofjudah moreover he put out zedekiahs eyes and bound him with chainsto carry him to babylon and the chaldeans burned the kings house and the houses of thepeople with fire and brake down the walls of jerusalem then nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captiveinto babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city andthose that fell away that fell to him with the rest of the peoplethat remained but nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of thepeople which had nothing in the land of judah and gave themvineyards and fields at the same time now nebuchadrezzar king of babylon gave charge concerningjeremiah to nebuzaradan the captain of the guard saying  takehim and look well to him and do him no harm but do unto him even ashe shall say unto thee so nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent and nebushasbanrabsaris and nergalsharezer rabmag and all the king of babylonsprinces  even they sent and took jeremiah out of the court ofthe prison and committed him unto gedaliah the son of ahikam the sonof shaphan that he should carry him home so he dwelt among thepeople now the word of the lord came unto jeremiah while he was shutup in the court of the prison saying  go and speak toebedmelech the ethiopian saying thus saith the lord of hosts thegod of israel behold i will bring my words upon this city for eviland not for good and they shall be accomplished in that day beforethee but i will deliver thee in that day saith the lord and thoushalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou art afraid for i will surely deliver thee and thou shalt not fall by thesword but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee because thou hastput thy trust in me saith the lord the word that came to jeremiah from the lord after thatnebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from ramah whenhe had taken him being bound in chains among all that were carriedaway captive of jerusalem and judah which were carried away captiveunto babylon and the captain of the guard took jeremiah and said unto himthe lord thy god hath pronounced this evil upon this place now the lord hath brought it and done according as he hath saidbecause ye have sinned against the lord and have not obeyed hisvoice therefore this thing is come upon you and now behold i loose thee this day from the chains which wereupon thine hand if it seem good unto thee to come with me intobabylon come and i will look well unto thee but if it seem ill untothee to come with me into babylon forbear behold all the land isbefore thee whither it seemeth good and convenient for thee to gothither go now while he was not yet gone back he said go back also togedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan whom the king ofbabylon hath made governor over the cities of judah and dwell withhim among the people or go wheresoever it seemeth convenient untothee to go so the captain of the guard gave him victuals and areward and let him go then went jeremiah unto gedaliah the son of ahikam to mizpah anddwelt with him among the people that were left in the land now when all the captains of the forces which were in the fieldseven they and their men heard that the king of babylon had madegedaliah the son of ahikam governor in the land and had committedunto him men and women and children and of the poor of the land ofthem that were not carried away captive to babylon  then theycame to gedaliah to mizpah even ishmael the son of nethaniah andjohanan and jonathan the sons of kareah and seraiah the son oftanhumeth and the sons of ephai the netophathite and jezaniah theson of a maachathite they and their men and gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan sware unto themand to their men saying fear not to serve the chaldeans dwell inthe land and serve the king of babylon and it shall be well withyou as for me behold i will dwell at mizpah to serve thechaldeans which will come unto us but ye gather ye wine and summerfruits and oil and put them in your vessels and dwell in yourcities that ye have taken likewise when all the jews that were in moab and among theammonites and in edom and that were in all the countries heard thatthe king of babylon had left a remnant of judah and that he had setover them gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan  evenall the jews returned out of all places whither they were driven andcame to the land of judah to gedaliah unto mizpah and gathered wineand summer fruits very much moreover johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of theforces that were in the fields came to gedaliah to mizpah  andsaid unto him dost thou certainly know that baalis the king of theammonites hath sent ishmael the son of nethaniah to slay thee butgedaliah the son of ahikam believed them not then johanan the son of kareah spake to gedaliah in mizpahsecretly saying let me go i pray thee and i will slay ishmael theson of nethaniah and no man shall know it wherefore should he slaythee that all the jews which are gathered unto thee should bescattered and the remnant in judah perish   but gedaliah theson of ahikam said unto johanan the son of kareah thou shalt not dothis thing for thou speakest falsely of ishmael now it came to pass in the seventh month that ishmael the son ofnethaniah the son of elishama of the seed royal and the princes ofthe king even ten men with him came unto gedaliah the son of ahikamto mizpah and there they did eat bread together in mizpah then arose ishmael the son of nethaniah and the ten men thatwere with him and smote gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphanwith the sword and slew him whom the king of babylon had madegovernor over the land ishmael also slew all the jews that were with him even withgedaliah at mizpah and the chaldeans that were found there and themen of war and it came to pass the second day after he had slain gedaliahand no man knew it  that there came certain from shechem fromshiloh and from samaria even fourscore men having their beardsshaven and their clothes rent and having cut themselves withofferings and incense in their hand to bring them to the house of thelord and ishmael the son of nethaniah went forth from mizpah to meetthem weeping all along as he went and it came to pass as he metthem he said unto them come to gedaliah the son of ahikam and it was so when they came into the midst of the city thatishmael the son of nethaniah slew them and cast them into the midstof the pit he and the men that were with him but ten men were found among them that said unto ishmael slay usnot for we have treasures in the field of wheat and of barley andof oil and of honey so he forbare and slew them not among theirbrethren now the pit wherein ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of themen whom he had slain because of gedaliah was it which asa the kinghad made for fear of baasha king of israel and ishmael the son ofnethaniah filled it with them that were slain then ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the peoplethat were in mizpah even the kings daughters and all the peoplethat remained in mizpah whom nebuzaradan the captain of the guard hadcommitted to gedaliah the son of ahikam and ishmael the son ofnethaniah carried them away captive and departed to go over to theammonites but when johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of theforces that were with him heard of all the evil that ishmael the sonof nethaniah had done  then they took all the men and went tofight with ishmael the son of nethaniah and found him by the greatwaters that are in gibeon now it came to pass that when all the people which were withishmael saw johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of theforces that were with him then they were glad so all the people that ishmael had carried away captive frommizpah cast about and returned and went unto johanan the son ofkareah but ishmael the son of nethaniah escaped from johanan with eightmen and went to the ammonites then took johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of theforces that were with him all the remnant of the people whom he hadrecovered from ishmael the son of nethaniah from mizpah after thathe had slain gedaliah the son of ahikam even mighty men of war andthe women and the children and the eunuchs whom he had broughtagain from gibeon  and they departed and dwelt in thehabitation of chimham which is by bethlehem to go to enter intoegypt  because of the chaldeans for they were afraid of thembecause ishmael the son of nethaniah had slain gedaliah the son ofahikam whom the king of babylon made governor in the land then all the captains of the forces and johanan the son ofkareah and jezaniah the son of hoshaiah and all the people from theleast even unto the greatest came near  and said unto jeremiahthe prophet let we beseech thee our supplication be accepted beforethee and pray for us unto the lord thy god even for all thisremnant for we are left but a few of many as thine eyes do beholdus  that the lord thy god may shew us the way wherein we maywalk and the thing that we may do then jeremiah the prophet said unto them i have heard youbehold i will pray unto the lord your god according to your wordsand it shall come to pass that whatsoever thing the lord shall answeryou i will declare it unto you i will keep nothing back from you then they said to jeremiah the lord be a true and faithfulwitness between us if we do not even according to all things for thewhich the lord thy god shall send thee to us whether it be good or whether it be evil we will obey the voiceof the lord our god to whom we send thee that it may be well withus when we obey the voice of the lord our god and it came to pass after ten days that the word of the lordcame unto jeremiah then called he johanan the son of kareah and all the captains ofthe forces which were with him and all the people from the least evento the greatest  and said unto them thus saith the lord the godof israel unto whom ye sent me to present your supplication beforehim  if ye will still abide in this land then will i build youand not pull you down and i will plant you and not pluck you up fori repent me of the evil that i have done unto you be not afraid of the king of babylon of whom ye are afraid benot afraid of him saith the lord for i am with you to save you andto deliver you from his hand and i will shew mercies unto you that he may have mercy uponyou and cause you to return to your own land but if ye say we will not dwell in this land neither obey thevoice of the lord your god  saying no but we will go into theland of egypt where we shall see no war nor hear the sound of thetrumpet nor have hunger of bread and there will we dwell  andnow therefore hear the word of the lord ye remnant of judah thussaith the lord of hosts the god of israel if ye wholly set yourfaces to enter into egypt and go to sojourn there  then itshall come to pass that the sword which ye feared shall overtakeyou there in the land of egypt and the famine whereof ye wereafraid shall follow close after you there in egypt and there yeshall die so shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go intoegypt to sojourn there they shall die by the sword by the famineand by the pestilence and none of them shall remain or escape fromthe evil that i will bring upon them for thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel as mineanger and my fury hath been poured forth upon the inhabitants ofjerusalem so shall my fury be poured forth upon you when ye shallenter into egypt and ye shall be an execration and an astonishmentand a curse and a reproach and ye shall see this place no more the lord hath said concerning you o ye remnant of judah go yenot into egypt know certainly that i have admonished you this day for ye dissembled in your hearts when ye sent me unto the lordyour god saying pray for us unto the lord our god and accordingunto all that the lord our god shall say so declare unto us and wewill do it and now i have this day declared it to you but ye have notobeyed the voice of the lord your god nor any thing for the which hehath sent me unto you now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the sword bythe famine and by the pestilence in the place whither ye desire togo and to sojourn and it came to pass that when jeremiah had made an end ofspeaking unto all the people all the words of the lord their god forwhich the lord their god had sent him to them even all these words then spake azariah the son of hoshaiah and johanan the son ofkareah and all the proud men saying unto jeremiah thou speakestfalsely the lord our god hath not sent thee to say go not into egyptto sojourn there  but baruch the son of neriah setteth thee onagainst us for to deliver us into the hand of the chaldeans thatthey might put us to death and carry us away captives into babylon so johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the forcesand all the people obeyed not the voice of the lord to dwell in theland of judah but johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of theforces took all the remnant of judah that were returned from allnations whither they had been driven to dwell in the land of judah even men and women and children and the kings daughters andevery person that nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left withgedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan and jeremiah theprophet and baruch the son of neriah so they came into the land of egypt for they obeyed not thevoice of the lord thus came they even to tahpanhes then came the word of the lord unto jeremiah in tahpanhessaying  take great stones in thine hand and hide them in theclay in the brickkiln which is at the entry of pharaohs house intahpanhes in the sight of the men of judah  and say unto themthus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel behold i will sendand take nebuchadrezzar the king of babylon my servant and will sethis throne upon these stones that i have hid and he shall spread hisroyal pavilion over them and when he cometh he shall smite the land of egypt anddeliver such as are for death to death and such as are for captivityto captivity and such as are for the sword to the sword and i will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of egypt andhe shall burn them and carry them away captives and he shall arrayhimself with the land of egypt as a shepherd putteth on his garmentand he shall go forth from thence in peace he shall break also the images of bethshemesh that is in theland of egypt and the houses of the gods of the egyptians shall heburn with fire the word that came to jeremiah concerning all the jews whichdwell in the land of egypt which dwell at migdol and at tahpanhesand at noph and in the country of pathros saying  thus saiththe lord of hosts the god of israel ye have seen all the evil that ihave brought upon jerusalem and upon all the cities of judah andbehold this day they are a desolation and no man dwelleth therein because of their wickedness which they have committed to provokeme to anger in that they went to burn incense and to serve othergods whom they knew not neither they ye nor your fathers howbeit i sent unto you all my servants the prophets risingearly and sending them saying oh do not this abominable thing thati hate but they hearkened not nor inclined their ear to turn from theirwickedness to burn no incense unto other gods wherefore my fury and mine anger was poured forth and waskindled in the cities of judah and in the streets of jerusalem andthey are wasted and desolate as at this day therefore now thus saith the lord the god of hosts the god ofisrael wherefore commit ye this great evil against your souls to cutoff from you man and woman child and suckling out of judah to leaveyou none to remain  in that ye provoke me unto wrath with theworks of your hands burning incense unto other gods in the land ofegypt whither ye be gone to dwell that ye might cut yourselves offand that ye might be a curse and a reproach among all the nations ofthe earth   have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers andthe wickedness of the kings of judah and the wickedness of theirwives and your own wickedness and the wickedness of your wiveswhich they have committed in the land of judah and in the streets ofjerusalem   they are not humbled even unto this day neitherhave they feared nor walked in my law nor in my statutes that i setbefore you and before your fathers therefore thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israelbehold i will set my face against you for evil and to cut off alljudah and i will take the remnant of judah that have set their facesto go into the land of egypt to sojourn there and they shall all beconsumed and fall in the land of egypt they shall even be consumedby the sword and by the famine they shall die from the least evenunto the greatest by the sword and by the famine and they shall bean execration and an astonishment and a curse and a reproach for i will punish them that dwell in the land of egypt as ihave punished jerusalem by the sword by the famine and by thepestilence  so that none of the remnant of judah which are goneinto the land of egypt to sojourn there shall escape or remain thatthey should return into the land of judah to the which they have adesire to return to dwell there for none shall return but such asshall escape then all the men which knew that their wives had burned incenseunto other gods and all the women that stood by a great multitudeeven all the people that dwelt in the land of egypt in pathrosanswered jeremiah saying  as for the word that thou hast spokenunto us in the name of the lord we will not hearken unto thee but we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of ourown mouth to burn incense unto the queen of heaven and to pour outdrink offerings unto her as we have done we and our fathers ourkings and our princes in the cities of judah and in the streets ofjerusalem for then had we plenty of victuals and were well and sawno evil but since we left off to burn incense to the queen of heavenand to pour out drink offerings unto her we have wanted all thingsand have been consumed by the sword and by the famine and when we burned incense to the queen of heaven and pouredout drink offerings unto her did we make her cakes to worship herand pour out drink offerings unto her without our men   thenjeremiah said unto all the people to the men and to the women andto all the people which had given him that answer saying  theincense that ye burned in the cities of judah and in the streets ofjerusalem ye and your fathers your kings and your princes and thepeople of the land did not the lord remember them and came it notinto his mind   so that the lord could no longer bear becauseof the evil of your doings and because of the abominations which yehave committed therefore is your land a desolation and anastonishment and a curse without an inhabitant as at this day because ye have burned incense and because ye have sinnedagainst the lord and have not obeyed the voice of the lord norwalked in his law nor in his statutes nor in his testimoniestherefore this evil is happened unto you as at this day moreover jeremiah said unto all the people and to all thewomen hear the word of the lord all judah that are in the land ofegypt  thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel sayingye and your wives have both spoken with your mouths and fulfilledwith your hand saying we will surely perform our vows that we havevowed to burn incense to the queen of heaven and to pour out drinkofferings unto her ye will surely accomplish your vows and surelyperform your vows therefore hear ye the word of the lord all judah that dwell inthe land of egypt behold i have sworn by my great name saith thelord that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man ofjudah in all the land of egypt saying the lord god liveth behold i will watch over them for evil and not for good andall the men of judah that are in the land of egypt shall be consumedby the sword and by the famine until there be an end of them yet a small number that escape the sword shall return out of theland of egypt into the land of judah and all the remnant of judahthat are gone into the land of egypt to sojourn there shall knowwhose words shall stand mine or theirs and this shall be a sign unto you saith the lord that i willpunish you in this place that ye may know that my words shall surelystand against you for evil  thus saith the lord behold i willgive pharaohhophra king of egypt into the hand of his enemies andinto the hand of them that seek his life as i gave zedekiah king ofjudah into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon his enemy andthat sought his life the word that jeremiah the prophet spake unto baruch the son ofneriah when he had written these words in a book at the mouth ofjeremiah in the fourth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah king ofjudah saying  thus saith the lord the god of israel unto theeo baruch  thou didst say woe is me now for the lord hath addedgrief to my sorrow i fainted in my sighing and i find no rest thus shalt thou say unto him the lord saith thus behold thatwhich i have built will i break down and that which i have planted iwill pluck up even this whole land and seekest thou great things for thyself seek them not forbehold i will bring evil upon all flesh saith the lord but thy lifewill i give unto thee for a prey in all places whither thou goest the word of the lord which came to jeremiah the prophet againstthe gentiles  against egypt against the army of pharaohnechoking of egypt which was by the river euphrates in carchemish whichnebuchadrezzar king of babylon smote in the fourth year of jehoiakimthe son of josiah king of judah order ye the buckler

stumble and fall toward the north by the river euphrates who is this that cometh up as a flood whose waters are moved asthe rivers   egypt riseth up like a flood and his waters aremoved like the rivers and he saith i will go up and will cover theearth i will destroy the city and the inhabitants thereof come up ye horses and rage ye chariots and let the mighty mencome forth the ethiopians and the libyans that handle the shieldand the lydians that handle and bend the bow for this is the day of the lord god of hosts a day ofvengeance that he may avenge him of his adversaries and the swordshall devour and it shall be satiate and made drunk with their bloodfor the lord god of hosts hath a sacrifice in the north country by theriver euphrates go up into gilead and take balm o virgin

lord though it cannotbe searched because they are more than the grasshoppers and areinnumerable the daughter of egypt shall be confounded she shall bedelivered into the hand of the people of the north the lord of hosts the god of israel saith behold i willpunish the multitude of no and pharaoh and egypt with their godsand their kings even pharaoh and all them that trust in him and i will deliver them into the hand of those that seek their livesand into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and into the handof his servants and afterward it shall be inhabited as in the daysof old saith the lord but fear not thou o my servant jacob and be not dismayed oisrael for behold i will save thee from afar off and thy seed fromthe land of their captivity and jacob shall return and be in restand at

spoken give wings unto moab that it may flee and get away for thecities thereof shall be desolate without any to dwell therein cursed be he that doeth the work of the lord deceitfully andcursed be he that keepeth back his sword from blood moab hath been at ease from his youth and he hath settled onhis lees and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel neitherhath he gone into captivity therefore his taste remained in him andhis scent is not changed therefore behold the days come saith the lord that i willsend unto him wanderers that shall cause him to wander and shallempty his vessels and

the lord him thatoffereth in the high places and him that burneth incense to his gods therefore mine heart shall sound for moab like pipes and mineheart shall sound like pipes for the men of kirheres because theriches that he hath gotten are perished for every head shall be bald and every beard clipped upon allthe hands shall be cuttings and upon the loins sackcloth there shall be lamentation generally upon all the housetops ofmoab and in the streets thereof for i have broken moab like a vesselwherein is no pleasure saith the lord they shall howl saying how is it broken down how hath moabturned the back with shame so shall moab be a derision and adismaying to all them about him for thus saith the lord behold he shall fly as an eagle andshall spread his wings over moab kerioth is

hathmagnified himself against the lord fear and the pit and the snare shall be upon thee oinhabitant of moab saith the lord he that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit and hethat getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare for i willbring upon it even upon moab the year of their visitation saith thelord they that fled stood under the shadow of heshbon because of theforce but a fire shall come forth out of heshbon and a flame fromthe midst of sihon and shall devour the corner of moab and the crownof the head of the tumultuous ones woe be unto thee o moab the people of chemosh perisheth forthy sons are taken captives and thy daughters captives yet will i bring again the captivity of moab in the latter dayssaith the lord thus far is the judgment of moab concerning the ammonites thus saith the lord hath israel nosons  hath he no heir why then doth their king inherit gad and hispeople dwell in his cities   therefore behold the days comesaith the lord that i will cause an alarm of war to be heard inrabbah of the ammonites and it shall be a desolate heap and herdaughters shall be burned with fire then shall israel be heir untothem that were his heirs saith the lord howl o heshbon for ai is spoiled cry ye daughters of rabbahgird you with sackcloth lament and run to and fro by the hedges fortheir king shall go into captivity and his priests and his

thelord god of hosts from all those that be about thee and ye shall bedriven out every man right forth and none shall gather up him thatwandereth and afterward i will bring again the captivity of the children ofammon saith the lord concerning edom thus saith the lord of hosts is wisdom no morein teman is counsel perished from the prudent is their wisdomvanished   flee ye turn back dwell deep o inhabitants ofdedan for i will bring the calamity of esau upon him the time that iwill visit him if grapegatherers come to thee would they not leave somegleaning grapes if thieves by night they will destroy till they haveenough but i have made esau bare i have uncovered his secret placesand he shall not be able to hide himself his seed is spoiled and hisbrethren and his neighbours and he is not leave thy fatherless children i will preserve them alive andlet thy widows trust in me for thus saith the lord behold they whose judgment was not todrink of the cup have assuredly drunken and art thou he that shallaltogether go unpunished thou shalt not go unpunished but thou shaltsurely drink of it for i have sworn by myself saith the lord that bozrah shallbecome a desolation a reproach a waste and a curse and all thecities thereof shall be perpetual wastes i have heard a rumour from the lord and an ambassador is sentunto the heathen saying gather ye together and come against herand rise up to the battle for lo i will make thee small among the heathen and despisedamong men thy terribleness hath deceived thee and the pride of thineheart o thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock that holdestthe height of the hill though thou shouldest make thy nest as high asthe eagle i will bring thee down from thence saith the lord also edom shall be a desolation every one that goeth by itshall be astonished and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof as in the overthrow of sodom and gomorrah and the neighbourcities thereof saith the lord no man shall abide there neithershall a son of man

over herfor who is like me and who will appoint me the time and who is thatshepherd that will stand before me   therefore hear the counselof the lord that he hath taken against edom and his purposes thathe hath purposed against the inhabitants of teman surely the least ofthe flock shall draw them out surely he shall make their habitationsdesolate with them the earth is moved at the noise of their fall at the cry thenoise thereof was heard in the red sea behold he shall come up and fly as the eagle and spread hiswings over bozrah and at that day shall the heart of the mighty menof edom be as the heart of a woman in her pangs concerning damascus hamath is confounded and arpad for theyhave heard evil tidings they are fainthearted there is sorrow on thesea it cannot be quiet damascus is waxed feeble and turneth herself to flee and fearhath seized on her anguish and sorrows have taken her as a woman intravail how is the city of praise not left the city of my joy  therefore her young

lordof hosts thus saith the lord of hosts the broad walls of babylon shallbe utterly broken and her high gates shall be burned with fire andthe people shall labour in vain and the folk in the fire and theyshall be weary the word which jeremiah the prophet commanded seraiah the son ofneriah the son of maaseiah when he went with zedekiah the king ofjudah into babylon in the fourth year of his reign and this seraiahwas a quiet prince so jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come uponbabylon even all these words that are written against babylon and jeremiah said to seraiah when thou comest to babylon andshalt see and shalt read all these words  then shalt thou sayo lord thou hast spoken against this place to cut it off that noneshall remain in it neither man nor beast but that it shall bedesolate for ever and it shall be when thou hast made an end of reading thisbook that thou shalt bind a stone to it and cast it into the midstof euphrates  and thou shalt say thus shall babylon sink andshall not rise from the evil that i will bring upon her and theyshall be weary thus far are the words of jeremiah zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign andhe reigned eleven years in jerusalem and his mothers name washamutal the daughter of jeremiah of libnah and he did that which was evil in the eyes of the lord accordingto all that jehoiakim had done for through the anger of the lord it came to pass in jerusalemand judah till he had cast them out from his presence that zedekiahrebelled against the king of babylon and it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign in the tenthmonth in the tenth day of the month that nebuchadrezzar king ofbabylon came he and all his army against jerusalem and pitchedagainst it and built forts against it round about so the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king zedekiah and in the fourth month in the ninth day of the month thefamine was sore in the city so that there was no bread for the peopleof the land then the city was broken up and all the men of war fled andwent forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between thetwo walls which was by the kings garden now the chaldeans were bythe city round about and they went by the way of the plain but the army of the chaldeans pursued after the king andovertook zedekiah in the plains of jericho and all his army wasscattered from him then they took the king and carried him up unto the king ofbabylon to riblah in the land of hamath where he gave judgment uponhim and the king of babylon slew the sons of zedekiah before hiseyes he slew also all the princes of judah in riblah then he put out the eyes of zedekiah and the king of babylonbound him in chains and carried him to babylon and put him in prisontill the day of his death now in the fifth month in the tenth day of the month which wasthe nineteenth year of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon camenebuzaradan captain of the guard which served the king of babyloninto jerusalem  and burned the house of the lord and the kingshouse and all the houses of jerusalem and all the houses of thegreat men burned he with fire  and all the army of thechaldeans that were with the captain of the guard brake down all thewalls of jerusalem round about then nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captivecertain of the poor of the people and the residue of the people thatremained in the city and those that fell away that fell to the kingof babylon and the rest of the multitude but nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left certain of thepoor of the land for vinedressers and for husbandmen also the pillars of brass that were in the house of the lordand the bases and the brasen sea that was in the house of the lordthe chaldeans brake and carried all the brass of them to babylon the caldrons also and the shovels and the snuffers and thebowls and the spoons and all the vessels of brass wherewith theyministered took they away and the basons and the firepans and the bowls and thecaldrons and the candlesticks and the spoons and the cups thatwhich was of gold in gold and that which was of silver in silvertook the captain of the guard away the two pillars one sea and twelve brasen bulls that wereunder the bases which king solomon had made in the house of the lordthe brass of all these vessels was without weight and concerning the pillars the height of one pillar waseighteen cubits and a fillet of twelve cubits did compass it and thethickness thereof was four fingers it was hollow and a chapiter of brass was upon it and the height of onechapiter was five cubits with network and pomegranates upon thechapiters round about all of brass the second pillar also and thepomegranates were like unto these and there were ninety and six pomegranates on a side and allthe pomegranates upon the network were an hundred round about and the captain of the guard took seraiah the chief priest andzephaniah the second priest and the three keepers of the door he

mustered the people of the land and threescore men of the peopleof the land that were found in the midst of the city so nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them and broughtthem to the king of babylon to riblah and the king of babylon smote them and put them to death inriblah in the land of hamath thus judah was carried away captive outof his own land this is the people whom nebuchadrezzar

four livingcreatures and this was their appearance they had the likeness of aman and every one had four faces and every one had four wings and their feet were straight feet and the sole of their feet waslike the sole of a calfs foot and they sparkled like the colour ofburnished brass and they had the hands of a man under their wings on their foursides and they four had their faces and their wings their wings were joined one to another they turned not when theywent they went every one straight forward as for the likeness of their faces they four had the face of aman and the face of a lion on the right side and they four had theface of an ox on the left side they four also had the face of aneagle thus were their faces and their wings were stretched upward twowings of every one were joined one to another and two covered theirbodies and they went every one straight forward whither the spirit wasto go they went and they turned not when they went as for the likeness of the living creatures their appearance waslike burning coals of fire and like the appearance of lamps it wentup and down among the living creatures and the fire was bright andout of the fire went forth lightning and the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of aflash of lightning now as i beheld the living creatures behold one wheel upon theearth by the living creatures with his four faces the appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto thecolour of a beryl and they four had one likeness and theirappearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of awheel when they went they went upon their four sides and they turnednot when they went as for their rings they were so high that they were dreadfuland their rings were full of eyes round about them four and when the living creatures went the wheels went by them andwhen the living creatures were lifted up from the earth the wheelswere lifted up whithersoever the spirit was to go they went thither was theirspirit to go and the wheels were lifted up over against them for thespirit of the living creature was in the wheels when those went these went and when those stood these stoodand when those were lifted up from the earth the wheels were liftedup over against them for the spirit of the living creature was in thewheels and the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the livingcreature was as the colour of the terrible crystal stretched forthover their heads above and under the firmament were their wings straight the one towardthe other every one had two which covered on this side and everyone had two which covered on that side their bodies and when they went i heard the noise of their wings like thenoise of great waters as the voice of the almighty the voice ofspeech as the noise of an host when they stood they let down theirwings and there was a voice from the firmament that was over theirheads when they stood and had let down their wings and above the firmament that was over their heads was thelikeness of a throne as the appearance of a sapphire stone and uponthe likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a manabove upon it and i saw as the colour of amber as the appearance of fire roundabout within it from the appearance of his loins even upward andfrom the appearance of his loins even downward i saw as it were theappearance of fire and it had brightness round about as the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day ofrain so was the appearance of the brightness round about this wasthe appearance of the likeness of the glory of the lord and when isaw it i fell upon my face and i heard a voice of one that spake and he said unto me son of man stand upon thy feet and i willspeak unto thee and the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me and set meupon my feet that i heard him that spake unto me and he said unto me son of man i send thee to the children ofisrael to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me they andtheir fathers have transgressed against me even unto this very day for they are impudent children and stiffhearted i do send theeunto them and thou shalt say unto them thus saith the lord god and they whether they will hear or whether they will forbearfor they are a rebellious house yet shall know that there hath beena prophet among them and thou son of man be not afraid of them neither be afraid oftheir words though briers and thorns be with thee and thou dostdwell among scorpions be not afraid of their words nor be dismayedat their looks though they be a rebellious house and thou shalt speak my words unto them whether they will hearor whether they will forbear for they are most rebellious but thou son of man hear what i say unto thee be not thourebellious like that rebellious house open thy mouth and eat that igive thee and when i looked behold an hand was sent unto me and lo aroll of a book was therein  and he spread it before me and itwas written within and without and there was written thereinlamentations and mourning and woe moreover he said unto me son of man eat that thou findest eatthis roll and go speak unto the house of israel so i opened my mouth and he caused me to eat that roll and he said unto me son of man cause thy belly to eat and fillthy bowels with this roll that i give thee then did i eat it and itwas in my mouth as honey for sweetness and he said unto me son of man go get thee unto the house ofisrael and speak with my words unto them for thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of anhard language but to the house of israel  not to many people of astrange speech and of an hard language whose words thou canst notunderstand surely had i sent thee to them they would have hearkenedunto thee but the house of israel will not hearken unto thee for they willnot hearken unto me for all the house of israel are impudent andhardhearted behold i have made thy face strong against their faces and thyforehead strong against their foreheads as an adamant harder than flint have i made thy forehead fearthem not neither be dismayed at their looks though they be arebellious house moreover he said unto me son of man all my words that i shallspeak unto thee receive in thine heart and hear with thine ears and go get thee to them of the captivity unto the children ofthy people and speak unto them and tell them thus saith the lordgod whether they will hear or whether they will forbear then the spirit took me up and i heard behind me a voice of agreat rushing saying blessed be the glory of the lord from hisplace i heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures thattouched one another and the noise of the wheels over against themand a noise of a great rushing so the spirit lifted me up and took me away and i went inbitterness in the heat of my spirit but the hand of the lord wasstrong upon me then i came to them of the captivity at telabib that dwelt bythe river of chebar and i sat where they sat and remained thereastonished among them seven days and it came to pass at the end of seven days that the word ofthe lord came unto me saying  son of man i have made thee awatchman unto the house of israel therefore hear the word at mymouth and give them warning from me when i say unto the wicked thou shalt surely die and thougivest him not warning nor speakest to warn the wicked from hiswicked way to save his life the same wicked man shall die in hisiniquity but his blood will i require at thine hand yet if thou warn the wicked and he turn not from his wickednessnor from his wicked way he shall die in his iniquity but thou hastdelivered thy soul again when a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness andcommit iniquity and i lay a stumblingblock before him he shall diebecause thou hast not given him warning he shall die in his sin andhis righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered but hisblood will i require at thine hand nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man that the righteoussin not and he doth not sin he shall surely live because he iswarned also thou hast delivered thy soul and the hand of the lord was there upon me and he said unto mearise go forth into the plain and i will there talk with thee then i arose and went forth into the plain and behold theglory of the lord stood there as the glory which i saw by the riverof chebar and i fell on my face then the spirit entered into me and set me upon my feet andspake with me and said unto me go shut thyself within thine house but thou o son of man behold they shall put bands upon theeand shall bind thee with them and thou shalt not go out among them and i will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth thatthou shalt be dumb and shalt not be to them a reprover for they area rebellious house but when i speak with thee i will open thy mouth and thou shaltsay unto them thus saith the lord god he that heareth let him hearand he that forbeareth let him forbear for they are a rebellioushouse thou also son of man take thee a tile and lay it before theeand pourtray upon it the city even jerusalem  and lay siegeagainst it and build a fort against it and cast a mount against itset the camp also against it and set battering rams against it roundabout moreover take thou unto thee an iron pan and set it for a wall ofiron between thee and the city and set thy face against it and itshall be besieged and thou shalt lay siege against it this shall bea sign to the house of israel lie thou also upon thy left side and lay the iniquity of thehouse of israel upon it according to the number of the days that thoushalt lie upon it thou shalt bear their iniquity for i have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity accordingto the number of the days three hundred and ninety days so shaltthou bear the iniquity of the house of israel and when thou hast accomplished them lie again on thy right sideand thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of judah forty days ihave appointed thee each day for a year therefore thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of jerusalemand thine arm shall be uncovered and thou shalt prophesy against it and behold i will lay bands upon thee and thou shalt not turnthee from one side to another till thou hast ended the days of thysiege take thou also unto thee wheat and barley and beans andlentiles and millet and fitches and put them in one vessel andmake thee bread thereof according to the number of the days that thoushalt lie upon thy side three hundred and ninety days shalt thou eatthereof and thy meat which thou shalt eat shall be by weight twentyshekels a day from time to time shalt thou eat it thou shalt drink also water by measure the sixth part of an hinfrom time to time shalt thou drink and thou shalt eat it as barley cakes and thou shalt bake itwith dung that cometh out of man in their sight and the lord said even thus shall the children of israel eattheir defiled bread among the gentiles whither i will drive them then said i ah lord god behold my soul hath not been pollutedfor from my youth up even till now have i not eaten of that whichdieth of itself or is torn in pieces neither came there abominableflesh into my mouth then he said unto me lo i have given thee cows dung for mansdung and thou shalt prepare thy bread therewith moreover he said unto me son of man behold i will break thestaff of bread in jerusalem and they shall eat bread by weight andwith care and they shall drink water by measure and withastonishment  that they may want bread and water and be astoniedone with another and consume away for their iniquity and thou son of man take thee a sharp knife take thee abarbers razor and cause it to pass upon thine head and upon thybeard then take thee balances to weigh and divide the hair thou shalt burn with fire a third part in the midst of the citywhen the days of the siege are fulfilled and thou shalt take a thirdpart and smite about it with a knife and a third part thou shaltscatter in the wind and i will draw out a sword after them thou shalt also take thereof a few in number and bind them in thyskirts then take of them again and cast them into the midst of the fireand burn them in the fire for thereof shall a fire come forth intoall the house of israel thus saith the lord god this is jerusalem i have set it in themidst of the nations and countries that are round about her and she hath changed my judgments into wickedness more than thenations and my statutes more than the countries that are round abouther for they have refused my judgments and my statutes they have notwalked in them therefore thus saith the lord god because ye multiplied more thanthe nations that are round about you and have not walked in mystatutes neither have kept my judgments neither have done accordingto the judgments of the nations that are round about you therefore thus saith the lord god behold i even i am against theeand will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of thenations and i will do in thee that which i have not done and whereunto iwill not do any more the like because of all thine abominations therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of theeand the sons shall eat their fathers and i will execute judgments inthee and the whole remnant of thee will i scatter into all the winds wherefore as i live saith the lord god surely because thouhast defiled my sanctuary with all thy detestable things and with allthine abominations therefore will i also diminish thee neither shallmine eye spare neither will i have any pity a third part of thee shall die with the pestilence and withfamine shall they be consumed in the midst of thee and a third partshall fall by the sword round about thee and i will scatter a thirdpart into all the winds and i will draw out a sword after them thus shall mine anger be accomplished and i will cause my furyto rest upon them and i will be comforted and they shall know that ithe lord have spoken it in my zeal when i have accomplished my furyin them moreover i will make thee waste and a reproach among the nationsthat are round about thee in the sight of all that pass by so it shall be a reproach and a taunt an instruction and anastonishment unto the nations that are round about thee when i shallexecute judgments in thee in anger and in fury and in furious rebukesi the lord have spoken it when i shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine whichshall be for their destruction and which i will send to destroy youand i will increase the famine upon you and will break your staff ofbread  so will i send upon you famine and evil beasts and theyshall bereave thee and pestilence and blood shall pass through theeand i will bring the sword upon thee i the lord have spoken it and the word of the lord came unto me saying  son of man setthy face toward the mountains of israel and prophesy against them and say ye mountains of israel hear the word of the lord godthus saith the lord god to the mountains and to the hills to therivers and to the valleys behold i even i will bring a sword uponyou and i will destroy your high places and your altars shall be desolate and your images shall bebroken and i will cast down your slain men before your idols and i will lay the dead carcases of the children of israel beforetheir idols and i will scatter your bones round about your altars in all your dwellingplaces the cities shall be laid waste and thehigh places shall be desolate that your altars may be laid waste andmade desolate and your idols may be broken and cease and your imagesmay be cut down and your works may be abolished and the slain shall fall in the midst of you and ye shall knowthat i am the lord yet will i leave a remnant that ye may have some that shallescape the sword among the nations when ye shall be scattered throughthe countries and they that escape of you shall remember me among the nationswhither they shall be carried captives because i am broken with theirwhorish heart which hath departed from me and with their eyes whichgo a whoring after their idols and they shall lothe themselves forthe evils which they have committed in all their abominations and they shall know that i am the lord and that i have not saidin vain that i would do this evil unto them thus saith the lord god smite with thine hand and stamp withthy foot and say alas for all the evil abominations of the house ofisrael for they shall fall by the sword by the famine and by thepestilence he that is far off shall die of the pestilence and he that isnear shall fall by the sword and he that remaineth and is besiegedshall die by the famine thus will i accomplish my fury upon them then shall ye know that i am the lord when their slain men shallbe among their idols round about their altars upon every high hillin all the tops of the mountains and under every green tree andunder every thick oak the place where they did offer sweet savour toall their idols so will i stretch out my hand upon them and make the landdesolate yea more desolate than the wilderness toward diblath inall their habitations and they shall know that i am the lord moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying  also thouson of man thus saith the lord god unto the land of israel an endthe end is come upon the four corners of the land now is the end come upon thee and i will send mine anger uponthee and will judge thee according to thy ways and will recompenseupon thee all thine abominations and mine eye shall not spare thee neither will i have pity but iwill recompense thy ways upon thee and thine abominations shall be inthe midst of thee and ye shall know that i am the lord thus saith the lord god an evil an only evil behold is come an end is come the end is come it watcheth for thee behold itis come the morning is come unto thee o thou that dwellest in the landthe time is come the day of trouble is near and not the soundingagain of the mountains now will i shortly pour out my fury upon thee and accomplish mineanger upon thee and i will judge thee according to thy ways and willrecompense thee for all thine abominations and mine eye shall not spare neither will i have pity i willrecompense thee according to thy ways and thine abominations that arein the midst of thee and ye shall know that i am the lord thatsmiteth behold the day behold it is come the morning is gone forththe rod hath blossomed pride hath budded violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness none of them shallremain nor of their multitude nor of any of theirs neither shallthere be wailing for them the time is come the day draweth near let not the buyerrejoice nor the seller mourn for wrath is upon all the multitudethereof for the seller shall not return to that which is sold althoughthey were yet alive for the vision is touching the whole multitudethereof which shall not return neither shall any strengthen himselfin the iniquity of his life they have blown the trumpet even to make all ready but nonegoeth to the battle for my wrath is upon all the multitude thereof the sword is without and the pestilence and the famine withinhe that is in the field shall die with the sword and he that is inthe city famine and pestilence shall devour him but they that escape of them shall escape and shall be on themountains like doves of the valleys all of them mourning every onefor his iniquity all hands shall be feeble and all knees shall be weak as water they shall also gird themselves with sackcloth and horror shallcover them and shame shall be upon all faces and baldness upon alltheir heads they shall cast their silver in the streets and their gold shallbe removed their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliverthem in the day of the wrath of the lord they shall not satisfy theirsouls neither fill their bowels because it is the stumblingblock oftheir iniquity as for the beauty of his ornament he set it in majesty but theymade the images of their abominations and of their detestable thingstherein therefore have i set it far from them and i will give it into the hands of the strangers for a preyand to the wicked of the earth for a spoil and they shall pollute it my face will i turn also from them and they shall pollute mysecret place for the robbers shall enter into it and defile it make a chain for the land is full of bloody crimes and the cityis full of violence wherefore i will bring the worst of the heathen and they shallpossess their houses i will also make the pomp of the strong tocease and their holy places shall be defiled destruction cometh and they shall seek peace and there shall benone mischief shall come upon mischief and rumour shall be uponrumour then shall they seek a vision of the prophet but the lawshall perish from the priest and counsel from the ancients the king shall mourn and the prince shall be clothed withdesolation and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubledi will do unto them after their way and according to their desertswill i judge them and they shall know that i am the lord and it came to pass in the sixth year in the sixth month in thefifth day of the month as i sat in mine house and the elders ofjudah sat before me that the hand of the lord god fell there upon me then i beheld and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire fromthe appearance of his loins even downward fire and from his loinseven upward as the appearance of brightness as the colour of amber and he put forth the form of an hand and took me by a lock ofmine head and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and theheaven and brought me in the visions of god to jerusalem to the doorof the inner gate that looketh toward the north where was the seat ofthe image of jealousy which provoketh to jealousy and behold the glory of the god of israel was there accordingto the vision that i saw in the plain then said he unto me son of man lift up thine eyes now the waytoward the north so i lifted up mine eyes the way toward the northand behold northward at the gate of the altar this image of jealousyin the entry he said furthermore unto me son of man seest thou what they doeven the great abominations that the house of israel committeth herethat i should go far off from my sanctuary but turn thee yet againand thou shalt see greater abominations and he brought me to the door of the court and when i lookedbehold a hole in the wall then said he unto me son of man dig now in the wall and when ihad digged in the wall behold a door and he said unto me go in and behold the wicked abominationsthat they do here so i went in and saw and behold every form of creeping thingsand abominable beasts and all the idols of the house of israelpourtrayed upon the wall round about and there stood before them seventy men of the ancients of thehouse of israel and in the midst of them stood jaazaniah the son ofshaphan with every man his censer in his hand and a thick cloud ofincense went up then said he unto me son of man hast thou seen what theancients of the house of israel do in the dark every man in thechambers of his imagery for they say the lord seeth us not the lordhath forsaken the earth he said also unto me turn thee yet again and thou shalt seegreater abominations that they do then he brought me to the door of the gate of the lords housewhich was toward the north and behold there sat women weeping fortammuz then said he unto me hast thou seen this o son of man turnthee yet again and thou shalt see greater abominations than these and he brought me into the inner court of the lords house andbehold at the door of the temple of the lord between the porch andthe altar were about five and twenty men with their backs toward thetemple of the lord and their faces toward the east and theyworshipped the sun toward the east then he said unto me hast thou seen this o son of man is it alight thing to the house of judah that they commit the abominationswhich they commit here for they have filled the land with violenceand have returned to provoke me to anger and lo they put the branchto their nose therefore will i also deal in fury mine eye shall not spareneither will i have pity and though they cry in mine ears with a loudvoice yet will i not hear them he cried also in mine ears with a loud voice saying cause themthat have charge over the city to draw near even every man with hisdestroying weapon in his hand and behold six men came from the way of the higher gate whichlieth toward the north and every man a slaughter weapon in his handand one man among them was clothed with linen with a writers inkhornby his side and they went in and stood beside the brasen altar and the glory of the god of israel was gone up from the cherubwhereupon he was to the threshold of the house and he called to theman clothed with linen which had the writers inkhorn by his side and the lord said unto him go through the midst of the citythrough the midst of jerusalem and set a mark upon the foreheads ofthe men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be donein the midst thereof and to the others he said in mine hearing go ye after him throughthe city and smite let not your eye spare neither have ye pity slay utterly old and young both maids and little children andwomen but come not near any man upon whom is the mark and begin atmy sanctuary then they began at the ancient men which were before thehouse and he said unto them defile the house and fill the courts withthe slain go ye forth and they went forth and slew in the city and it came to pass while they were slaying them and i was leftthat i fell upon my face and cried and said ah lord god wilt thoudestroy all the residue of israel in thy pouring out of thy fury uponjerusalem   then said he unto me the iniquity of the house ofisrael and judah is exceeding great and the land is full of bloodand the city full of perverseness for they say the lord hathforsaken the earth and the lord seeth not and as for me also mine eye shall not spare neither will i havepity but i will recompense their way upon their head and behold the man clothed with linen which had the inkhorn byhis side reported the matter saying i have done as thou hastcommanded me then i looked and behold in the firmament that was above thehead of the cherubims there appeared over them as it were a sapphirestone as the appearance of the likeness of a throne and he spake unto the man clothed with linen and said go inbetween the wheels even under the cherub and fill thine hand withcoals of fire from between the cherubims and scatter them over thecity and he went in in my sight now the cherubims stood on the right side of the house when theman went in and the cloud filled the inner court then the glory of the lord went up from the cherub and stoodover the threshold of the house and the house was filled with thecloud and the court was full of the brightness of the lords glory and the sound of the cherubims wings was heard even to the outercourt as the voice of the almighty god when he speaketh and it came to pass that when he had commanded the man clothedwith linen saying take fire from between the wheels from betweenthe cherubims then he went in and stood beside the wheels and one cherub stretched forth his hand from between thecherubims unto the fire that was between the cherubims and tookthereof and put it into the hands of him that was clothed with linenwho took it and went out and there appeared in the cherubims the form of a mans handunder their wings and when i looked behold the four wheels by the cherubims onewheel by one cherub and another wheel by another cherub and theappearance of the wheels was as the colour of a beryl stone and as for their appearances they four had one likeness as ifa wheel had been in the midst of a wheel when they went they went upon their four sides they turned notas they went but to the place whither the head looked they followedit they turned not as they went and their whole body and their backs and their hands andtheir wings and the wheels were full of eyes round about even thewheels that they four had as for the wheels it was cried unto them in my hearing owheel and every one had four faces the first face was the face of acherub and the second face was the face of a man and the third theface of a lion and the fourth the face of an eagle and the cherubims were lifted up this is the living creaturethat i saw by the river of chebar and when the cherubims went the wheels went by them and whenthe cherubims lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth thesame wheels also turned not from beside them when they stood these stood and when they were lifted upthese lifted up themselves also for the spirit of the living creaturewas in them then the glory of the lord departed from off the threshold ofthe house and stood over the cherubims and the cherubims lifted up their wings and mounted up from theearth in my sight when they went out the wheels also were besidethem and every one stood at the door of the east gate of the lordshouse and the glory of the god of israel was over them above this is the living creature that i saw under the god of israelby the river of chebar and i knew that they were the cherubims every one had four faces apiece and every one four wings andthe likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings and the likeness of their faces was the same faces which i sawby the river of chebar their appearances and themselves they wentevery one straight forward moreover the spirit lifted me up and brought me unto the eastgate of the lords house which looketh eastward and behold at thedoor of the gate five and twenty men among whom i saw jaazaniah theson of azur and pelatiah the son of benaiah princes of the people then said he unto me son of man these are the men that devisemischief and give wicked counsel in this city  which say it isnot near let us build houses this city is the caldron and we be theflesh therefore prophesy against them prophesy o son of man and the spirit of the lord fell upon me and said unto me speakthus saith the lord thus have ye said o house of israel for i knowthe things that come into your mind every one of them ye have multiplied your slain in this city and ye have filledthe streets thereof with the slain therefore thus saith the lord god your slain whom ye have laidin the midst of it they are the flesh and this city is the caldronbut i will bring you forth out of the midst of it ye have feared the sword and i will bring a sword upon yousaith the lord god and i will bring you out of the midst thereof and deliver youinto the hands of strangers and will execute judgments among you ye shall fall by the sword i will judge you in the border ofisrael and ye shall know that i am the lord this city shall not be your caldron neither shall ye be theflesh in the midst thereof but i will judge you in the border ofisrael  and ye shall know that i am the lord for ye have notwalked in my statutes neither executed my judgments but have doneafter the manners of the heathen that are round about you and it came to pass when i prophesied that pelatiah the son ofbenaiah died then fell i down upon my face and cried with a loudvoice and said ah lord god wilt thou make a full end of the remnantof israel   again the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man thy brethren even thy brethren the men of thykindred and all the house of israel wholly are they unto whom theinhabitants of jerusalem have said get you far from the lord unto usis this land given in possession therefore say thus saith the lord god although i have castthem far off among the heathen and although i have scattered themamong the countries yet will i be to them as a little sanctuary inthe countries where they shall come therefore say thus saith the lord god i will even gather youfrom the people and assemble you out of the countries where ye havebeen scattered and i will give you the land of israel and they shall come thither and they shall take away all thedetestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof fromthence and i will give them one heart and i will put a new spiritwithin you and i will take the stony heart out of their flesh andwill give them an heart of flesh  that they may walk in mystatutes and keep mine ordinances and do them and they shall be mypeople and i will be their god but as for them whose heart walketh after the heart of theirdetestable things and their abominations i will recompense their wayupon their own heads saith the lord god then did the cherubims lift up their wings and the wheelsbeside them and the glory of the god of israel was over them above and the glory of the lord went up from the midst of the cityand stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city afterwards the spirit took me up and brought me in a vision bythe spirit of god into chaldea to them of the captivity so thevision that i had seen went up from me then i spake unto them of the captivity all the things that thelord had shewed me the word of the lord also came unto me saying  son of manthou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house which have eyes tosee and see not they have ears to hear and hear not for they are arebellious house therefore thou son of man prepare thee stuff for removing andremove by day in their sight and thou shalt remove from thy place toanother place in their sight it may be they will consider thoughthey be a rebellious house then shalt thou bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight asstuff for removing and thou shalt go forth at even in their sight asthey that go forth into captivity dig thou through the wall in their sight and carry out thereby in their sight shalt thou bear it upon thy shoulders and carryit forth in the twilight thou shalt cover thy face that thou see notthe ground for i have set thee for a sign unto the house of israel and i did so as i was commanded i brought forth my stuff by dayas stuff for captivity and in the even i digged through the wall withmine hand i brought it forth in the twilight and i bare it upon myshoulder in their sight and in the morning came the word of the lord unto me saying son of man hath not the house of israel the rebellious housesaid unto thee what doest thou   say thou unto them thus saiththe lord god this burden concerneth the prince in jerusalem and allthe house of israel that are among them say i am your sign like as i have done so shall it be doneunto them they shall remove and go into captivity and the prince that is among them shall bear upon his shoulderin the twilight and shall go forth they shall dig through the wallto carry out thereby he shall cover his face that he see not theground with his eyes my net also will i spread upon him and he shall be taken in mysnare and i will bring him to babylon to the land of the chaldeansyet shall he not see it though he shall die there and i will scatter toward every wind all that are about him tohelp him and all his bands and i will draw out the sword after them and they shall know that i am the lord when i shall scatterthem among the nations and disperse them in the countries but i will leave a few men of them from the sword from thefamine and from the pestilence that they may declare all theirabominations among the heathen whither they come and they shall knowthat i am the lord moreover the word of the lord came to me saying  son ofman eat thy bread with quaking and drink thy water with tremblingand with carefulness  and say unto the people of the land thussaith the lord god of the inhabitants of jerusalem and of the land ofisrael they shall eat their bread with carefulness and drink theirwater with astonishment that her land may be desolate from all thatis therein because of the violence of all them that dwell therein and the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste and theland shall be desolate and ye shall know that i am the lord and the word of the lord came unto me saying  son of manwhat is that proverb that ye have in the land of israel saying thedays are prolonged and every vision faileth   tell themtherefore thus saith the lord god i will make this proverb to ceaseand they shall no more use it as a proverb in israel but say untothem the days are at hand and the effect of every vision for there shall be no more any vain vision nor flatteringdivination within the house of israel for i am the lord i will speak and the word that i shall speakshall come to pass it shall be no more prolonged for in your days orebellious house will i say the word and will perform it saith thelord god again the word of the lord came to me saying son of man behold they of the house of israel say the visionthat he seeth is for many days to come and he prophesieth of thetimes that are far off therefore say unto them thus saith the lord god there shallnone of my words be prolonged any more but the word which i havespoken shall be done saith the lord god and the word of the lord came unto me saying  son of manprophesy against the prophets of israel that prophesy and say thouunto them that prophesy out of their own hearts hear ye the word ofthe lord  thus saith the lord god woe unto the foolish prophetsthat follow their own spirit and have seen nothing   o israelthy prophets are like the foxes in the deserts ye have not gone up into the gaps neither made up the hedge forthe house of israel to stand in the battle in the day of the lord they have seen vanity and lying divination saying the lordsaith and the lord hath not sent them and they have made others tohope that they would confirm the word have ye not seen a vain vision and have ye not spoken a lyingdivination whereas ye say the lord saith it albeit i have notspoken   therefore thus saith the lord god because ye havespoken vanity and seen lies therefore behold i am against yousaith the lord god and mine hand shall be upon the prophets that see vanity andthat divine lies they shall not be in the assembly of my peopleneither shall they be written in the writing of the house of israelneither shall they enter into the land of israel and ye shall knowthat i am the lord god because even because they have seduced my people sayingpeace and there was no peace and one built up a wall and loothers daubed it with untempered morter  say unto them whichdaub it with untempered morter that it shall fall there shall be anoverflowing shower and ye o great hailstones shall fall and astormy wind shall rend it lo when the wall is fallen shall it not be said unto youwhere is the daubing wherewith ye have daubed it   thereforethus saith the lord god i will even rend it with a stormy wind in myfury and there shall be an overflowing shower in mine anger andgreat hailstones in my fury to consume it so will i break down the wall that ye have daubed withuntempered morter and bring it down to the ground so that thefoundation thereof shall be discovered and it shall fall and yeshall be consumed in the midst thereof and ye shall know that i amthe lord thus will i accomplish my wrath upon the wall and upon themthat have daubed it with untempered morter and will say unto you thewall is no more neither they that daubed it  to wit theprophets of israel which prophesy concerning jerusalem and which seevisions of peace for her and there is no peace saith the lord god likewise thou son of man set thy face against the daughters ofthy people which prophesy out of their own heart and prophesy thouagainst them  and say thus saith the lord god woe to the womenthat sew pillows to all armholes and make kerchiefs upon the head ofevery stature to hunt souls will ye hunt the souls of my people andwill ye save the souls alive that come unto you   and will yepollute me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces ofbread to slay the souls that should not die and to save the soulsalive that should not live by your lying to my people that hear yourlies   wherefore thus saith the lord god behold i am againstyour pillows wherewith ye there hunt the souls to make them fly andi will tear them from your arms and will let the souls go even thesouls that ye hunt to make them fly your kerchiefs also will i tear and deliver my people out ofyour hand and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted and yeshall know that i am the lord because with lies ye have made the heart of the righteous sadwhom i have not made sad and strengthened the hands of the wickedthat he should not return from his wicked way by promising him life therefore ye shall see no more vanity nor divine divinationsfor i will deliver my people out of your hand and ye shall know thati am the lord then came certain of the elders of israel unto me and sat beforeme and the word of the lord came unto me saying  son of manthese men have set up their idols in their heart and put thestumblingblock of their iniquity before their face should i beenquired of at all by them   therefore speak unto them and sayunto them thus saith the lord god every man of the house of israelthat setteth up his idols in his heart and putteth the stumblingblockof his iniquity before his face and cometh to the prophet i the lordwill answer him that cometh according to the multitude of his idols that i may take the house of israel in their own heart becausethey are all estranged from me through their idols therefore say unto the house of israel thus saith the lord godrepent and turn yourselves from your idols and turn away your facesfrom all your abominations for every one of the house of israel or of the stranger thatsojourneth in israel which separateth himself from me and setteth uphis idols in his heart and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquitybefore his face and cometh to a prophet to enquire of him concerningme i the lord will answer him by myself  and i will set my faceagainst that man and will make him a sign and a proverb and i willcut him off from the midst of my people and ye shall know that i amthe lord and if the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing i thelord have deceived that prophet and i will stretch out my hand uponhim and will destroy him from the midst of my people israel and they shall bear the punishment of their iniquity thepunishment of the prophet shall be even as the punishment of him thatseeketh unto him  that the house of israel may go no more astrayfrom me neither be polluted any more with all their transgressionsbut that they may be my people and i may be their god saith the lordgod the word of the lord came again to me saying  son of manwhen the land sinneth against me by trespassing grievously then willi stretch out mine hand upon it and will break the staff of the breadthereof and will send famine upon it and will cut off man and beastfrom it  though these three men noah daniel and job were init they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousnesssaith the lord god if i cause noisome beasts to pass through the land and theyspoil it so that it be desolate that no man may pass through becauseof the beasts  though these three men were in it as i livesaith the lord god they shall deliver neither sons nor daughtersthey only shall be delivered but the land shall be desolate or if i bring a sword upon that land and say sword go throughthe land so that i cut off man and beast from it  though thesethree men were in it as i live saith the lord god they shalldeliver neither sons nor daughters but they only shall be deliveredthemselves or if i send a pestilence into that land and pour out my furyupon it in blood to cut off from it man and beast  though noahdaniel and job were in it as i live saith the lord god they shalldeliver neither son nor daughter they shall but deliver their ownsouls by their righteousness for thus saith the lord god how much more when i send my foursore judgments upon jerusalem the sword and the famine and thenoisome beast and the pestilence to cut off from it man and beast yet behold therein shall be left a remnant that shall bebrought forth both sons and daughters behold they shall come forthunto you and ye shall see their way and their doings and ye shall becomforted concerning the evil that i have brought upon jerusalem evenconcerning all that i have brought upon it and they shall comfort you when ye see their ways and theirdoings and ye shall know that i have not done without cause all thati have done in it saith the lord god and the word of the lord came unto me saying  son of manwhat is the vine tree more than any tree or than a branch which isamong the trees of the forest   shall wood be taken thereof to doany work or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon behold it is cast into the fire for fuel the fire devourethboth the ends of it and the midst of it is burned is it meet for anywork   behold when it was whole it was meet for no work howmuch less shall it be meet yet for any work when the fire hathdevoured it and it is burned   therefore thus saith the lordgod as the vine tree among the trees of the forest which i havegiven to the fire for fuel so will i give the inhabitants ofjerusalem and i will set my face against them they shall go out from onefire and another fire shall devour them and ye shall know that i amthe lord when i set my face against them and i will make the land desolate because they have committed atrespass saith the lord god again the word of the lord came unto me saying  son of mancause jerusalem to know her abominations  and say thus saith thelord god unto jerusalem thy birth and thy nativity is of the land ofcanaan thy father was an amorite and thy mother an hittite and as for thy nativity in the day thou wast born thy navel wasnot cut neither wast thou washed in water to supple thee thou wastnot salted at all nor swaddled at all none eye pitied thee to do any of these unto thee to havecompassion upon thee but thou wast cast out in the open field to thelothing of thy person in the day that thou wast born and when i passed by thee and saw thee polluted in thine ownblood i said unto thee when thou wast in thy blood live yea i saidunto thee when thou wast in thy blood live i have caused thee to multiply as the bud of the field and thouhast increased and waxen great and thou art come to excellentornaments thy breasts are fashioned and thine hair is grown whereasthou wast naked and bare now when i passed by thee and looked upon thee behold thy timewas the time of love and i spread my skirt over thee and covered thynakedness yea i sware unto thee and entered into a covenant withthee saith the lord god and thou becamest mine then washed i thee with water yea i throughly washed away thyblood from thee and i anointed thee with oil i clothed thee also with broidered work and shod thee withbadgers skin and i girded thee about with fine linen and i coveredthee with silk i decked thee also with ornaments and i put bracelets upon thyhands and a chain on thy neck and i put a jewel on thy forehead and earrings in thine earsand a beautiful crown upon thine head thus wast thou decked with gold and silver and thy raiment wasof fine linen and silk and broidered work thou didst eat fineflour and honey and oil and thou wast exceeding beautiful and thoudidst prosper into a kingdom and thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty forit was perfect through my comeliness which i had put upon thee saiththe lord god but thou didst trust in thine own beauty and playedst theharlot because of thy renown and pouredst out thy fornications onevery one that passed by his it was and of thy garments thou didst take and deckedst thy highplaces with divers colours and playedst the harlot thereupon thelike things shall not come neither shall it be so thou hast also taken thy fair jewels of my gold and of mysilver which i had given thee and madest to thyself images of menand didst commit whoredom with them  and tookest thy broideredgarments and coveredst them and thou hast set mine oil and mineincense before them my meat also which i gave thee fine flour and oil and honeywherewith i fed thee thou hast even set it before them for a sweetsavour and thus it was saith the lord god moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters whom thouhast borne unto me and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to bedevoured is this of thy whoredoms a small matter  that thouhast slain my children and delivered them to cause them to passthrough the fire for them   and in all thine abominations andthy whoredoms thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth whenthou wast naked and bare and wast polluted in thy blood and it came to pass after all thy wickedness woe woe untothee  saith the lord god  that thou hast also built unto theean eminent place and hast made thee an high place in every street thou hast built thy high place at every head of the way andhast made thy beauty to be abhorred and hast opened thy feet to everyone that passed by and multiplied thy whoredoms thou hast also committed fornication with the egyptians thyneighbours great of flesh and hast increased thy whoredoms toprovoke me to anger behold therefore i have stretched out my hand over thee andhave diminished thine ordinary food and delivered thee unto the willof them that hate thee the daughters of the philistines which areashamed of thy lewd way thou hast played the whore also with the assyrians because thouwast unsatiable yea thou hast played the harlot with them and yetcouldest not be satisfied thou hast moreover multiplied thy fornication in the land ofcanaan unto chaldea and yet thou wast not satisfied therewith how weak is thine heart saith the lord god seeing thou doestall these things the work of an imperious whorish woman  inthat thou buildest thine eminent place in the head of every way andmakest thine high place in every street and hast not been as anharlot in that thou scornest hire  but as a wife thatcommitteth adultery which taketh strangers instead of her husband they give gifts to all whores but thou givest thy gifts to allthy lovers and hirest them that they may come unto thee on everyside for thy whoredom and the contrary is in thee from other women in thy whoredomswhereas none followeth thee to commit whoredoms and in that thougivest a reward and no reward is given unto thee therefore thou artcontrary wherefore o harlot hear the word of the lord  thus saiththe lord god because thy filthiness was poured out and thy nakednessdiscovered through thy whoredoms with thy lovers and with all theidols of thy abominations and by the blood of thy children whichthou didst give unto them  behold therefore i will gather allthy lovers with whom thou hast taken pleasure and all them that thouhast loved with all them that thou hast hated i will even gatherthem round about against thee and will discover thy nakedness untothem that they may see all thy nakedness and i will judge thee as women that break wedlock and shedblood are judged and i will give thee blood in fury and jealousy and i will also give thee into their hand and they shall throwdown thine eminent place and shall break down thy high places theyshall strip thee also of thy clothes and shall take thy fair jewelsand leave thee naked and bare they shall also bring up a company against thee and they shallstone thee with stones and thrust thee through with their swords and they shall burn thine houses with fire and executejudgments upon thee in the sight of many women and i will cause theeto cease from playing the harlot and thou also shalt give no hire anymore so will i make my fury toward thee to rest and my jealousyshall depart from thee and i will be quiet and will be no moreangry because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth but hastfretted me in all these things behold therefore i also willrecompense thy way upon thine head saith the lord god and thou shaltnot commit this lewdness above all thine abominations behold every one that useth proverbs shall use this proverbagainst thee saying as is the mother so is her daughter thou art thy mothers daughter that lotheth her husband and herchildren and thou art the sister of thy sisters which lothed theirhusbands and their children your mother was an hittite and yourfather an amorite and thine elder sister is samaria she and her daughters thatdwell at thy left hand and thy younger sister that dwelleth at thyright hand is sodom and her daughters yet hast thou not walked after their ways nor done after theirabominations but as if that were a very little thing thou wastcorrupted more than they in all thy ways as i live saith the lord god sodom thy sister hath not doneshe nor her daughters as thou hast done thou and thy daughters behold this was the iniquity of thy sister sodom pridefulness of bread and abundance of idleness was in her and in herdaughters neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy and they were haughty and committed abomination before metherefore i took them away as i saw good neither hath samaria committed half of thy sins but thou hastmultiplied thine abominations more than they and hast justified thysisters in all thine abominations which thou hast done thou also which hast judged thy sisters bear thine own shamefor thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they theyare more righteous than thou yea be thou confounded also and bearthy shame in that thou hast justified thy sisters when i shall bring again their captivity the captivity of sodomand her daughters and the captivity of samaria and her daughtersthen will i bring again the captivity of thy captives in the midst ofthem  that thou mayest bear thine own shame and mayest beconfounded in all that thou hast done in that thou art a comfort untothem when thy sisters sodom and her daughters shall return to theirformer estate and samaria and her daughters shall return to theirformer estate then thou and thy daughters shall return to your formerestate for thy sister sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the dayof thy pride  before thy wickedness was discovered as at thetime of thy reproach of the daughters of syria and all that are roundabout her the daughters of the philistines which despise thee roundabout thou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations saith thelord for thus saith the lord god i will even deal with thee as thouhast done which hast despised the oath in breaking the covenant nevertheless i will remember my covenant with thee in the daysof thy youth and i will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant then thou shalt remember thy ways and be ashamed when thoushalt receive thy sisters thine elder and thy younger and i willgive them unto thee for daughters but not by thy covenant and i will establish my covenant with thee and thou shalt knowthat i am the lord  that thou mayest remember and beconfounded and never open thy mouth any more because of thy shamewhen i am pacified toward thee for all that thou hast done saith thelord god and the word of the lord came unto me saying  son of manput forth a riddle and speak a parable unto the house of israel and say thus saith the lord god a great eagle with great wingslongwinged full of feathers which had divers colours came untolebanon and took the highest branch of the cedar  he cropped offthe top of his young twigs and carried it into a land of traffick heset it in a city of merchants he took also of the seed of the land and planted it in afruitful field he placed it by great waters and set it as a willowtree and it grew and became a spreading vine of low stature whosebranches turned toward him and the roots thereof were under him soit became a vine and brought forth branches and shot forth sprigs there was also another great eagle with great wings and manyfeathers and behold this vine did bend her roots toward him andshot forth her branches toward him that he might water it by thefurrows of her plantation it was planted in a good soil by great waters that it mightbring forth branches and that it might bear fruit that it might be agoodly vine say thou thus saith the lord god shall it prosper shall he notpull up the roots thereof and cut off the fruit thereof that itwither it shall wither in all the leaves of her spring even withoutgreat power or many people to pluck it up by the roots thereof yea behold being planted shall it prosper shall it notutterly wither when the east wind toucheth it it shall wither in thefurrows where it grew moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying  saynow to the rebellious house know ye not what these things mean  tellthem behold the king of babylon is come to jerusalem and hath takenthe king thereof and the princes thereof and led them with him tobabylon  and hath taken of the kings seed and made a covenantwith him and hath taken an oath of him he hath also taken the mightyof the land  that the kingdom might be base that it might notlift itself up but that by keeping of his covenant it might stand but he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors intoegypt that they might give him horses and much people shall heprosper shall he escape that doeth such things or shall he break thecovenant and be delivered   as i live saith the lord godsurely in the place where the king dwelleth that made him king whoseoath he despised and whose covenant he brake even with him in themidst of babylon he shall die neither shall pharaoh with his mighty army and great companymake for him in the war by casting up mounts and building forts tocut off many persons  seeing he despised the oath by breakingthe covenant when lo he had given his hand and hath done all thesethings he shall not escape therefore thus saith the lord god as i live surely mine oaththat he hath despised and my covenant that he hath broken even itwill i recompense upon his own head and i will spread my net upon him and he shall be taken in mysnare and i will bring him to babylon and will plead with him therefor his trespass that he hath trespassed against me and all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by thesword and they that remain shall be scattered toward all winds andye shall know that i the lord have spoken it thus saith the lord god i will also take of the highest branchof the high cedar and will set it i will crop off from the top ofhis young twigs a tender one and will plant it upon an high mountainand eminent  in the mountain of the height of israel will iplant it and it shall bring forth boughs and bear fruit and be agoodly cedar and under it shall dwell all fowl of every wing in theshadow of the branches thereof shall they dwell and all the trees of the field shall know that i the lord havebrought down the high tree have exalted the low tree have dried upthe green tree and have made the dry tree to flourish i the lordhave spoken and have done it the word of the lord came unto me again saying  what meanye that ye use this proverb concerning the land of israel sayingthe fathers have eaten sour grapes and the childrens teeth are seton edge   as i live saith the lord god ye shall not haveoccasion any more to use this proverb in israel behold all souls are mine as the soul of the father so alsothe soul of the son is mine the soul that sinneth it shall die but if a man be just and do that which is lawful and right and hath not eaten upon the mountains neither hath lifted up his eyesto the idols of the house of israel neither hath defiled hisneighbours wife neither hath come near to a menstruous woman and hath not oppressed any but hath restored to the debtor hispledge hath spoiled none by violence hath given his bread to thehungry and hath covered the naked with a garment  he that hathnot given forth upon usury neither hath taken any increase that hathwithdrawn his hand from iniquity hath executed true judgment betweenman and man  hath walked in my statutes and hath kept myjudgments to deal truly he is just he shall surely live saith thelord god if he beget a son that is a robber a shedder of blood and thatdoeth the like to any one of these things  and that doeth notany of those duties but even hath eaten upon the mountains anddefiled his neighbours wife  hath oppressed the poor and needyhath spoiled by violence hath not restored the pledge and hathlifted up his eyes to the idols hath committed abomination hath given forth upon usury and hath taken increase shall he thenlive he shall not live he hath done all these abominations he shallsurely die his blood shall be upon him now lo if he beget a son that seeth all his fathers sinswhich he hath done and considereth and doeth not such like that hath not eaten upon the mountains neither hath lifted up hiseyes to the idols of the house of israel hath not defiled hisneighbours wife  neither hath oppressed any hath notwithholden the pledge neither hath spoiled by violence but hathgiven his bread to the hungry and hath covered the naked with agarment  that hath taken off his hand from the poor that hathnot received usury nor increase hath executed my judgments hathwalked in my statutes he shall not die for the iniquity of hisfather he shall surely live as for his father because he cruelly oppressed spoiled hisbrother by violence and did that which is not good among his peoplelo even he shall die in his iniquity yet say ye why doth not the son bear the iniquity of thefather  when the son hath done that which is lawful and right andhath kept all my statutes and hath done them he shall surely live the soul that sinneth it shall die the son shall not bear theiniquity of the father neither shall the father bear the iniquity ofthe son the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him and thewickedness of the wicked shall be upon him but if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hathcommitted and keep all my statutes and do that which is lawful andright he shall surely live he shall not die all his transgressions that he hath committed they shall not bementioned unto him in his righteousness that he hath done he shalllive have i any pleasure at all that the wicked should die saith thelord god and not that he should return from his ways and live but when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness andcommitteth iniquity and doeth according to all the abominations thatthe wicked man doeth shall he live all his righteousness that hehath done shall not be mentioned in his trespass that he hathtrespassed and in his sin that he hath sinned in them shall he die yet ye say the way of the lord is not equal hear now o houseof israel is not my way equal are not your ways unequal   whena righteous man turneth away from his righteousness and committethiniquity and dieth in them for his iniquity that he hath done shallhe die again when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness thathe hath committed and doeth that which is lawful and right he shallsave his soul alive because he considereth and turneth away from all histransgressions that he hath committed he shall surely live he shallnot die yet saith the house of israel the way of the lord is not equalo house of israel are not my ways equal are not your ways unequal therefore i will judge you o house of israel every oneaccording to his ways saith the lord god repent and turn yourselvesfrom all your transgressions so iniquity shall not be your ruin cast away from you all your transgressions whereby ye havetransgressed and make you a new heart and a new spirit for why willye die o house of israel   for i have no pleasure in the deathof him that dieth saith the lord god wherefore turn yourselves andlive ye moreover take thou up a lamentation for the princes of israel and say what is thy mother a lioness she lay down among lionsshe nourished her whelps among young lions and she brought up one of her whelps it became a young lion andit learned to catch the prey it devoured men the nations also heard of him he was taken in their pit andthey brought him with chains unto the land of egypt now when she saw that she had waited and her hope was lost thenshe took another of her whelps and made him a young lion and he went up and down among the lions he became a young lionand learned to catch the prey and devoured men and he knew their desolate palaces and he laid waste theircities and the land was desolate and the fulness thereof by thenoise of his roaring then the nations set against him on every side from theprovinces and spread their net over him he was taken in their pit and they put him in ward in chains and brought him to the kingof babylon they brought him into holds that his voice should no morebe heard upon the mountains of israel thy mother is like a vine in thy blood planted by the watersshe was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters and she had strong rods for the sceptres of them that bare ruleand her stature was exalted among the thick branches and she appearedin her height with the multitude of her branches but she was plucked up in fury she was cast down to the groundand the east wind dried up her fruit her strong rods were broken andwithered the fire consumed them and now she is planted in the wilderness in a dry and thirstyground and fire is gone out of a rod of her branches which hathdevoured her fruit so that she hath no strong rod to be a sceptre torule this is a lamentation and shall be for a lamentation and it came to pass in the seventh year in the fifth month thetenth day of the month that certain of the elders of israel came toenquire of the lord and sat before me then came the word of the lord unto me saying  son of manspeak unto the elders of israel and say unto them thus saith thelord god are ye come to enquire of me as i live saith the lord godi will not be enquired of by you wilt thou judge them son of man wilt thou judge them causethem to know the abominations of their fathers  and say untothem thus saith the lord god in the day when i chose israel andlifted up mine hand unto the seed of the house of jacob and mademyself known unto them in the land of egypt when i lifted up minehand unto them saying i am the lord your god  in the day that ilifted up mine hand unto them to bring them forth of the land ofegypt into a land that i had espied for them flowing with milk andhoney which is the glory of all lands  then said i unto themcast ye away every man the abominations of his eyes and defile notyourselves with the idols of egypt i am the lord your god but they rebelled against me and would not hearken unto me theydid not every man cast away the abominations of their eyes neitherdid they forsake the idols of egypt then i said i will pour out myfury upon them to accomplish my anger against them in the midst ofthe land of egypt but i wrought for my names sake that it should not be pollutedbefore the heathen among whom they were in whose sight i made myselfknown unto them in bringing them forth out of the land of egypt wherefore i caused them to go forth out of the land of egyptand brought them into the wilderness and i gave them my statutes and shewed them my judgments whichif a man do he shall even live in them moreover also i gave them my sabbaths to be a sign between meand them that they might know that i am the lord that sanctify them but the house of israel rebelled against me in the wildernessthey walked not in my statutes and they despised my judgments whichif a man do he shall even live in them and my sabbaths they greatlypolluted then i said i would pour out my fury upon them in thewilderness to consume them but i wrought for my names sake that it should not be pollutedbefore the heathen in whose sight i brought them out yet also i lifted up my hand unto them in the wilderness that iwould not bring them into the land which i had given them flowingwith milk and honey which is the glory of all lands  becausethey despised my judgments and walked not in my statutes butpolluted my sabbaths for their heart went after their idols nevertheless mine eye spared them from destroying them neitherdid i make an end of them in the wilderness but i said unto their children in the wilderness walk ye not inthe statutes of your fathers neither observe their judgments nordefile yourselves with their idols  i am the lord your god walkin my statutes and keep my judgments and do them  and hallowmy sabbaths and they shall be a sign between me and you that ye mayknow that i am the lord your god notwithstanding the children rebelled against me they walkednot in my statutes neither kept my judgments to do them which if aman do he shall even live in them they polluted my sabbaths then isaid i would pour out my fury upon them to accomplish my angeragainst them in the wilderness nevertheless i withdrew mine hand and wrought for my namessake that it should not be polluted in the sight of the heathen inwhose sight i brought them forth i lifted up mine hand unto them also in the wilderness that iwould scatter them among the heathen and disperse them through thecountries  because they had not executed my judgments but haddespised my statutes and had polluted my sabbaths and their eyeswere after their fathers idols wherefore i gave them also statutes that were not good andjudgments whereby they should not live  and i polluted them intheir own gifts in that they caused to pass through the fire all thatopeneth the womb that i might make them desolate to the end thatthey might know that i am the lord therefore son of man speak unto the house of israel and sayunto them thus saith the lord god yet in this your fathers haveblasphemed me in that they have committed a trespass against me for when i had brought them into the land for the which ilifted up mine hand to give it to them then they saw every high hilland all the thick trees and they offered there their sacrifices andthere they presented the provocation of their offering there alsothey made their sweet savour and poured out there their drinkofferings then i said unto them what is the high place whereunto ye goand the name whereof is called bamah unto this day wherefore say unto the house of israel thus saith the lord godare ye polluted after the manner of your fathers and commit yewhoredom after their abominations   for when ye offer yourgifts when ye make your sons to pass through the fire ye polluteyourselves with all your idols even unto this day and shall i beenquired of by you o house of israel as i live saith the lord godi will not be enquired of by you and that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all thatye say we will be as the heathen as the families of the countriesto serve wood and stone as i live saith the lord god surely with a mighty hand andwith a stretched out arm and with fury poured out will i rule overyou  and i will bring you out from the people and will gatheryou out of the countries wherein ye are scattered with a mighty handand with a stretched out arm and with fury poured out and i will bring you into the wilderness of the people andthere will i plead with you face to face like as i pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of theland of egypt so will i plead with you saith the lord god and i will cause you to pass under the rod and i will bring youinto the bond of the covenant  and i will purge out from amongyou the rebels and them that transgress against me i will bring themforth out of the country where they sojourn and they shall not enterinto the land of israel and ye shall know that i am the lord as for you o house of israel thus saith the lord god go yeserve ye every one his idols and hereafter also if ye will nothearken unto me but pollute ye my holy name no more with your giftsand with your idols for in mine holy mountain in the mountain of the height ofisrael saith the lord god there shall all the house of israel allof them in the land serve me there will i accept them and therewill i require your offerings and the firstfruits of your oblationswith all your holy things i will accept you with your sweet savour when i bring you outfrom the people and gather you out of the countries wherein ye havebeen scattered and i will be sanctified in you before the heathen and ye shall know that i am the lord when i shall bring youinto the land of israel into the country for the which i lifted upmine hand to give it to your fathers and there shall ye remember your ways and all your doingswherein ye have been defiled and ye shall lothe yourselves in yourown sight for all your evils that ye have committed and ye shall know that i am the lord when i have wrought withyou for my names sake not according to your wicked ways noraccording to your corrupt doings o ye house of israel saith the lordgod moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying  son ofman set thy face toward the south and drop thy word toward thesouth and prophesy against the forest of the south field  andsay to the forest of the south hear the word of the lord thus saiththe lord god behold i will kindle a fire in thee and it shalldevour every green tree in thee and every dry tree the flaming flameshall not be quenched and all faces from the south to the north shallbe burned therein and all flesh shall see that i the lord

all countries those that be near and those that be far from thee shall mockthee which art infamous and much vexed behold the princes of israel every one were in thee to theirpower to shed blood in thee have they set light by father and mother in the midst ofthee have they dealt by oppression with the stranger in thee havethey vexed the fatherless and the widow thou hast despised mine holy things and hast profaned mysabbaths in thee are men that carry tales to shed blood and in thee theyeat upon the mountains in the midst of thee they commit lewdness in thee have they discovered their

another inthee hath humbled his sister his fathers daughter in thee have they taken gifts to shed blood thou hast takenusury and increase and thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbours byextortion and hast forgotten me saith the lord god behold therefore i have smitten mine hand at thy dishonest gainwhich thou hast made and at thy blood which hath been in the midst ofthee can thine heart endure or can thine hands be strong in thedays that i shall deal with thee i the lord have spoken it and willdo it and i will scatter thee among the heathen and disperse thee inthe countries and will consume thy filthiness out of thee and thou shalt take thine inheritance in thyself in the sight ofthe heathen and thou shalt know that i am the lord and the word of the lord came unto me saying  son of manthe house of israel is to me become dross all they are brass andtin and iron and lead in the midst of the furnace they are eventhe dross of silver therefore thus saith the lord god because ye are all becomedross behold therefore i will gather you into the midst ofjerusalem as they gather silver and brass and iron and lead and tininto the midst of the furnace to blow the fire upon it to melt itso will i gather you in mine anger and in my fury and i will leaveyou there and melt you yea i will gather you and blow upon you in the fire of mywrath and ye shall be melted in the midst therof as silver is melted in the midst of the furnace so shall ye bemelted in the midst thereof and ye shall know that i the lord havepoured out my fury upon you and the word of the lord came unto me saying  son of mansay unto her thou art the land that is not cleansed nor rained uponin the day of indignation there is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof likea roaring lion ravening the prey they have devoured souls they havetaken the treasure and precious things they have made her many widowsin the midst thereof her priests have violated my law and have profaned mine holythings they have put no difference between the holy and profaneneither have they shewed difference between the unclean and the cleanand have hid their eyes from my sabbaths and i am profaned amongthem her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening theprey to shed blood and to destroy souls to get dishonest gain and her prophets have daubed them with untempered morter seeingvanity and divining lies unto them saying thus saith the lord godwhen the lord hath not spoken the people of the land have used oppression and exercisedrobbery and have vexed the poor and needy yea they have oppressedthe stranger wrongfully and i sought for a man among them that should make up thehedge and stand in the gap before me for the land that i should notdestroy it but i found none therefore have i poured out mine indignation upon them i haveconsumed them with the fire of my wrath their own way have irecompensed upon their heads saith the lord god the word of the lord came again unto me saying  son of manthere were two women the daughters of one mother  and theycommitted whoredoms in egypt they committed whoredoms in their youththere were their breasts pressed and there they bruised the teats oftheir virginity and the names of them were aholah the elder and aholibah hersister and they were mine and they bare sons and daughters thuswere their names samaria is aholah and jerusalem aholibah and aholah played the harlot when she was mine and she doted onher lovers on the assyrians her neighbours  which were clothedwith blue captains and rulers all of them desirable young menhorsemen riding upon horses thus she committed her whoredoms with them with all them thatwere the chosen men of assyria and with all on whom she doted withall their idols she defiled herself neither left she her whoredoms brought from egypt for in heryouth they lay with her and they bruised the breasts of hervirginity and poured their whoredom upon her wherefore i have delivered her into the hand of her lovers intothe hand of the assyrians upon whom she doted these discovered her nakedness they took her sons and herdaughters and slew her with the sword and she became famous amongwomen for they had executed judgment upon her and when her sister aholibah saw this she was more corrupt inher inordinate love than she and in her whoredoms more than hersister in her whoredoms she doted upon the assyrians her neighbours captains and rulersclothed most gorgeously horsemen riding upon horses all of themdesirable young men then i saw that she was defiled that they took both one way and that she increased her whoredoms for when she saw menpourtrayed upon the wall the images of the chaldeans pourtrayed withvermilion  girded with girdles upon their loins exceeding indyed attire upon their heads all of them princes to look to afterthe manner of the babylonians of chaldea the land of their nativity and as soon as she saw them with her eyes she doted upon themand sent messengers unto them into chaldea and the babylonians came to her into the bed of love and theydefiled her with their whoredom and she was polluted with them andher mind was alienated from them so she discovered her whoredoms and discovered her nakednessthen my mind was alienated from her like as my mind was alienatedfrom her sister yet she multiplied her whoredoms in calling to remembrance thedays of her youth wherein she had played the harlot in the land ofegypt for she doted upon their paramours whose flesh is as the fleshof asses and whose issue is like the issue of horses thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth inbruising thy teats by the egyptians for the paps of thy youth therefore o aholibah thus saith the lord god behold i willraise up thy lovers against thee from whom thy mind is alienated andi will bring them against thee on every side  the babyloniansand all the chaldeans pekod and shoa and koa and all the assyrianswith them all of them desirable young men captains and rulers greatlords and renowned all of them riding upon horses and they shall come against thee with chariots wagons andwheels and with an assembly of people which shall set against theebuckler and shield and helmet round about and i will set judgmentbefore them and they shall judge thee according to their judgments and i will set my jealousy against thee and they shall dealfuriously with thee they shall take away thy nose and thine ears andthy remnant shall fall by the sword they shall take thy sons and thydaughters and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire they shall also strip thee out of thy clothes and take away thyfair jewels thus will i make thy lewdness to cease from thee and thywhoredom brought from the land of egypt so that thou shalt not liftup thine eyes unto them nor remember egypt any more for thus saith the lord god behold i will deliver thee intothe hand of them whom thou hatest into the hand of them from whom thymind is alienated  and they shall deal with thee hatefully andshall take away all thy labour and shall leave thee naked and bareand the nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be discovered both thylewdness and thy whoredoms i will do these things unto thee because thou hast gone awhoring after the heathen and because thou art polluted with theiridols thou hast walked in the way of thy sister therefore will i giveher cup into thine hand thus saith the lord god thou shalt drink of thy sisters cupdeep and large thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in derision itcontaineth much thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow with the cupof astonishment and desolation with the cup of thy sister samaria thou shalt even drink it and suck it out and thou shalt breakthe sherds thereof and pluck off thine own breasts for i have spokenit saith the lord god therefore thus saith the lord god because thou hast forgottenme and cast me behind thy back therefore bear thou also thy lewdnessand thy whoredoms the lord said moreover unto me son of man wilt thou judgeaholah and aholibah yea declare unto them their abominations that they have committed adultery and blood is in their hands andwith their idols have they committed adultery and have also causedtheir sons whom they bare unto me to pass for them through the fireto devour them moreover this they have done unto me they have defiled mysanctuary in the same day and have profaned my sabbaths for when they had slain their children to their idols then theycame the same day into my sanctuary to profane it and lo thus havethey done in the midst of mine house and furthermore that ye have sent for men to come from farunto whom a messenger was sent and lo they came for whom thoudidst wash thyself paintedst thy eyes and deckedst thyself withornaments  and satest upon a stately bed and a table preparedbefore it whereupon thou hast set mine incense and mine oil and a voice of a multitude being at ease was with her and withthe men of the common sort were brought sabeans from the wildernesswhich put bracelets upon their hands and beautiful crowns upon theirheads then said i unto her that was old in adulteries will they nowcommit whoredoms with her and she with them   yet they went inunto her as they go in unto a woman that playeth the harlot so wentthey in unto aholah and unto aholibah the lewd women and the righteous men they shall judge them after the manner ofadulteresses and after the manner of women that shed blood becausethey are adulteresses and blood is in their hands for thus saith the lord god i will bring up a company uponthem and will give them to be removed and spoiled and the company shall stone them with stones and dispatch themwith their swords they shall slay their sons and their daughters andburn up their houses with fire thus will i cause lewdness to cease out of the land that allwomen may be taught not to do after your lewdness and they shall recompense your lewdness upon you and ye shallbear the sins of your idols and ye shall know that i am the lord god again in the ninth year in the tenth month in the tenth day ofthe month the word of the lord came unto me saying  son of manwrite thee the name of the day even of this same day the king ofbabylon set himself against jerusalem this same day and utter a parable unto the rebellious house and say unto themthus saith the lord god set on a pot set it on and also pour waterinto it  gather the pieces thereof into it even every goodpiece the thigh and the shoulder fill it with the choice bones take the choice of the flock and burn also the bones under itand make it boil well and let them seethe the bones of it therein wherefore thus saith the lord god woe to the bloody city to thepot whose scum is therein and whose scum is not gone out of it bringit out piece by piece let no lot fall upon it for her blood is in the midst of her she set it upon the top ofa rock she poured it not upon the ground to cover it with dust that it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance i have set herblood upon the top of a rock that it should not be covered therefore thus saith the lord god woe to the bloody city i willeven make the pile for fire great heap on wood kindle the fire consume the flesh and spice itwell and let the bones be burned then set it empty upon the coals thereof that the brass of itmay be hot and may burn and that the filthiness of it may be moltenin it that the scum of it may be consumed she hath wearied herself with lies and her great scum went notforth out of her her scum shall be in the fire in thy filthiness is lewdness because i have purged thee andthou wast not purged thou shalt not be purged from thy filthiness anymore till i have caused my fury to rest upon thee i the lord have spoken it it shall come to pass and i will doit i will not go back neither will i spare neither will i repentaccording to thy ways and according to thy doings shall they judgethee saith the lord god also the word of the lord came unto me saying  son ofman

ofthine head upon thee and put on thy shoes upon thy feet and covernot thy lips and eat not the bread of men so i spake unto the people in the morning and at even my wifedied and i did in the morning as i was commanded and the people said unto me wilt thou not tell us what thesethings are to us that thou doest so   then i answered them theword of the lord came unto me saying  speak unto the house

confidence of the house of israelwhich bringeth their iniquity to remembrance when they shall lookafter them but they shall know that i am the lord god and it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year in thefirst month in the first day of the month the word of the lord cameunto me saying  son of man nebuchadrezzar king of babyloncaused his army to serve a great service against tyrus every head wasmade bald and every shoulder was peeled yet had he no wages nor hisarmy for tyrus for the service that he had served against it therefore thus saith the lord god behold i will give the land ofegypt

wherewith heserved against it because they wrought for me saith the lord god in that day will i cause the horn of the house of israel to budforth and i will give thee the opening of the mouth in the

to pass in the eleventh year in the first month inthe seventh day of the month that the word of the lord came unto mesaying  son of man i have broken the arm of pharaoh king ofegypt and lo it shall not be bound up to be healed to put a rollerto bind it to make it strong to hold the sword therefore thus saith the lord god behold i am against pharaohking of egypt and will break his arms the strong and that which wasbroken and i will cause the sword to fall out of his hand and i will scatter the egyptians among the nations and willdisperse them through the countries and i will strengthen the arms of the king of babylon and putmy sword in his hand but i will break pharaohs arms and he shallgroan before him with the groanings of a deadly wounded man but i will strengthen the arms of the king of babylon and thearms of pharaoh shall fall down and they shall know that i am thelord when i shall put my sword into the hand of the king of babylonand he shall stretch it out upon the land of egypt and i will scatter the egyptians among the nations and dispersethem among the countries and they shall know that i am the lord and it came to pass in the eleventh year in the third month inthe first day of the month that the word of the lord came unto mesaying  son of man speak unto pharaoh king of egypt and to hismultitude whom art thou like in thy greatness   behold theassyrian was a cedar in lebanon with fair branches and with ashadowing shroud and of an high stature and his top was among thethick boughs the waters made him great the deep set him up on high with herrivers running round about his plants and sent her little rivers untoall the trees of the field therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of thefield and his boughs were multiplied and his branches became longbecause of the multitude of waters when he shot forth all the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs and underhis branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their youngand under his shadow dwelt all great nations thus was he fair in his greatness in the length of his branchesfor his root was by great waters the cedars in the garden of god could not hide him the fir treeswere not like his boughs and the chestnut trees were not like hisbranches nor any tree in the garden of god was like unto him in hisbeauty i have made him fair by the multitude of his branches so thatall the trees of eden that were in the garden of god envied him therefore thus saith the lord god because thou hast lifted upthyself in height and he hath shot up his top among the thick boughsand his heart is lifted up in his height  i have thereforedelivered him into the hand of the mighty one of the heathen he shallsurely deal with him i have driven him out for his wickedness and strangers the terrible of the nations have cut him offand have left him upon the mountains and in all the valleys hisbranches are fallen and his boughs are broken by all the rivers ofthe land and all the people of the earth are gone down from hisshadow and have left him upon his ruin shall all the fowls of the heaven remain and allthe beasts of the field shall be upon his branches  to the endthat none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves for theirheight neither shoot up their top among the thick boughs neithertheir trees stand up in their height all that drink water for theyare all delivered unto death to the nether parts of the earth in themidst of the children of men with them that go down to the pit thus saith the lord god in the day when he went down to thegrave i caused a mourning i covered the deep for him and irestrained the floods thereof and the great waters were stayed and icaused lebanon to mourn for him and all the trees of the fieldfainted for him i made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall when icast him down to hell with them that descend into the pit and all thetrees of eden the choice and best of lebanon all that drink watershall be comforted in the nether parts of the earth they also went down into hell with him unto them that be slainwith the sword and they that were his arm that dwelt under hisshadow in the midst of the heathen to whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among thetrees of eden yet shalt thou be brought down with the trees of edenunto the nether parts of the earth thou shalt lie in the midst of theuncircumcised with them that be slain by the sword this is pharaohand all his multitude saith the lord god and it came to pass in the twelfth year in the twelfth month inthe first day of the month that the word of the lord came unto mesaying  son of man take up a lamentation for pharaoh king ofegypt and say unto him thou art like a young lion of the nationsand thou art as a whale in the seas and thou camest forth with thyrivers and troubledst the waters with thy feet and fouledst theirrivers thus saith the lord god i will therefore spread out my net overthee with a company of many people and they shall bring thee up in mynet then will i leave thee upon the land i will cast thee forth uponthe open field and will cause all the fowls of the heaven to remainupon thee and i will fill the beasts of the whole earth with thee and i will lay thy flesh upon the mountains and fill the valleyswith thy height i will also water with thy blood the land wherein thou swimmesteven to the mountains and the rivers shall be full of thee and when i shall put thee out i will cover the heaven and makethe stars thereof dark i will cover the sun with a cloud and themoon shall not give her light all the bright lights of heaven will i make dark over thee andset darkness upon thy land saith the lord god i will also vex the hearts of many people when i shall bring thydestruction among the nations into the countries which thou hast notknown yea i will make many people amazed at thee and their kingsshall be horribly afraid for thee when i shall brandish my swordbefore them and they shall tremble at every moment every man for hisown life in the day of thy fall for thus saith the lord god the sword of the king of babylonshall come upon thee by the swords of the mighty will i cause thy multitude to fallthe terrible of the nations all of them and they shall spoil thepomp of egypt and all the multitude thereof shall be destroyed i will destroy also all the beasts thereof from beside the greatwaters neither shall the foot of man trouble them any more nor thehoofs of beasts trouble them then will i make their waters deep and cause their rivers torun like oil saith the lord god when i shall make the land of egypt desolate and the countryshall be destitute of that whereof it was full when i shall smite allthem that dwell therein then shall they know that i am the lord this is the lamentation wherewith they shall lament her thedaughters of the nations shall lament her they shall lament for hereven for egypt and for all her multitude saith the lord god it came to pass also in the twelfth year in the fifteenth dayof the month that the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man wail for the multitude of egypt and cast them down evenher and the daughters of the famous nations unto the nether parts ofthe earth with them that go down into the pit whom dost thou pass in beauty go down and be thou laid withthe uncircumcised they shall fall in the midst of them that are slain by thesword she is delivered to the sword draw her and all her multitudes the strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midstof hell with them that help him they are gone down they lieuncircumcised slain by the sword asshur is there and all her company his graves are about himall of them slain fallen by the sword  whose graves are set inthe sides of the pit and her company is round about her grave all ofthem slain fallen by the sword which caused terror in the land ofthe living there is elam and all her multitude round about her grave allof them slain fallen by the sword which are gone down uncircumcisedinto the nether parts of the earth which caused their terror in theland of the living yet have they borne their shame with them that godown to the pit they have set her a bed in the midst of the slain with all hermultitude her graves are round about him all of them uncircumcisedslain by the sword though their terror was caused in the land of theliving yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to thepit he is put in the midst of them that be slain there is meshech tubal and all her multitude her graves areround about him all of them uncircumcised slain by the sword thoughthey caused their terror in the land of the living and they shall not lie with the mighty that are fallen of theuncircumcised which are gone down to hell with their weapons of warand they have laid their swords under their heads but theiriniquities shall be upon their bones though they were the terror ofthe mighty in the land of the living yea thou shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised andshalt lie with them that are slain with the sword there is edom her kings and all her princes which with theirmight are laid by them that were slain by the sword they shall liewith the uncircumcised and with them that go down to the pit there be the princes of the north all of them and all thezidonians which are gone down with the slain with their terror theyare ashamed of their might and they lie uncircumcised with them thatbe slain by the sword and bear their shame with them that go down tothe pit pharaoh shall see them and shall be comforted over all hismultitude even pharaoh and all his army slain by the sword saith thelord god for i have caused my terror in the land of the living and heshall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that areslain with the sword even pharaoh and all his multitude saith thelord god again the word of the lord came unto me saying  son of manspeak to the children of thy people and say unto them when i bringthe sword upon a land if the people of the land take a man of theircoasts and set him for their watchman  if when he seeth thesword come upon the land he blow the trumpet and warn the people then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet and taketh notwarning if the sword come and take him away his blood shall be uponhis own head he heard the sound of the trumpet and took not warning hisblood shall be upon him but he that taketh warning shall deliver hissoul but if the watchman see the sword come and blow not the trumpetand the people be not warned if the sword come and take any personfrom among them he is taken away in his iniquity but his blood willi require at the watchmans hand so thou o son of man i have set thee a watchman unto the houseof israel therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth and warnthem from me when i say unto the wicked o wicked man thou shalt surely dieif thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way that wickedman shall die in his iniquity but his blood will i require at thinehand nevertheless if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from itif he do not turn from his way he shall die in his iniquity but thouhast delivered thy soul therefore o thou son of man speak unto the house of israelthus ye speak saying if our transgressions and our sins be upon usand we pine away in them how should we then live   say untothem as i live saith the lord god i have no pleasure in the deathof the wicked but that the wicked turn from his way and live turnye turn ye from your evil ways for why will ye die o house ofisrael   therefore thou son of man say unto the children ofthy people the righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver himin the day of his transgression as for the wickedness of the wickedhe shall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from hiswickedness neither shall the righteous be able to live for hisrighteousness in the day that he sinneth when i shall say to the righteous that he shall surely live ifhe trust to his own righteousness and commit iniquity all hisrighteousnesses shall not be remembered but for his iniquity that hehath committed he shall die for it again when i say unto the wicked thou shalt surely die if heturn from his sin and do that which is lawful and right  if thewicked restore the pledge give again that he had robbed walk in thestatutes of life without committing iniquity he shall surely livehe shall not die none of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned untohim he hath done that which is lawful and right he shall surelylive yet the children of thy people say the way of the lord is notequal but as for them their way is not equal when the righteous turneth from his righteousness andcommitteth iniquity he shall even die thereby but if the wicked turn from his wickedness and do that which islawful and right he shall live thereby yet ye say the way of the lord is not equal o ye house ofisrael i will judge you every one after his ways and it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity in thetenth month in the fifth day of the month that one that had escapedout of jerusalem came unto me saying the city is smitten now the hand of the lord was upon me in the evening afore hethat was escaped came and had opened my mouth until he came to me inthe morning and my mouth was opened and i was no more dumb then the word of the lord came unto me saying  son ofman they that inhabit those wastes of the land of israel speaksaying abraham was one and he inherited the land but we are manythe land is given us for inheritance wherefore say unto them thus saith the lord god ye eat withthe blood and lift up your eyes toward your idols and shed bloodand shall ye possess the land   ye stand upon your sword yework abomination and ye defile every one his neighbours wife andshall ye possess the land   say thou thus unto them thus saiththe lord god as i live surely they that are in the wastes shall fallby the sword and him that is in the open field will i give to thebeasts to be devoured and they that be in the forts and in the cavesshall die of the pestilence for i will lay the land most desolate and the pomp of herstrength shall cease and the mountains of israel shall be desolatethat none shall pass through then shall they know that i am the lord when i have laid theland most desolate because of all their abominations which they havecommitted also thou son of man the children of thy people still aretalking against thee by the walls and in the doors of the houses andspeak one to another every one to his brother saying come i prayyou and hear what is the word that cometh forth from the lord and they come unto thee as the people cometh and they sitbefore thee as my people and they hear thy words but they will notdo them for with their mouth they shew much love but their heartgoeth after their covetousness and lo thou art unto them as a very lovely song of one thathath a pleasant voice and can play well on an instrument for theyhear thy words but they do them not and when this cometh to pass lo it will come then shallthey know that a prophet hath been among them and the word of the lord came unto me saying  son of manprophesy against the shepherds of israel prophesy and say unto themthus saith the lord god unto the shepherds woe be to the shepherds ofisrael that do feed themselves should not the shepherds feed theflocks   ye eat the fat and ye clothe you with the wool ye killthem that are fed but ye feed not the flock the diseased have ye not strengthened neither have ye healedthat which was sick neither have ye bound up that which was brokenneither have ye brought again that which was driven away neither haveye sought that which was lost but with force and with cruelty have yeruled them and they were scattered because there is no shepherd and theybecame meat to all the beasts of the field when they were scattered my sheep wandered through all the mountains and upon every highhill yea my flock was scattered upon all the face of the earth andnone did search or seek after them therefore ye shepherds hear the word of the lord  as ilive saith the lord god surely because my flock became a prey andmy flock became meat to every beast of the field because there was noshepherd neither did my shepherds search for my flock but theshepherds fed themselves and fed not my flock  therefore o yeshepherds hear the word of the lord  thus saith the lord godbehold i am against the shepherds and i will require my flock attheir hand and cause them to cease from feeding the flock neithershall the shepherds feed themselves any more for i will deliver myflock from their mouth that they may not be meat for them for thus saith the lord god behold i even i will both searchmy sheep and seek them out as a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is amonghis sheep that are scattered so will i seek out my sheep and willdeliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in thecloudy and dark day and i will bring them out from the people and gather them fromthe countries and will bring them to their own land and feed themupon the mountains of israel by the rivers and in all the inhabitedplaces of the country i will feed them in a good pasture and upon the high mountainsof israel shall their fold be there shall they lie in a good foldand in a fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of israel i will feed my flock and i will cause them to lie down saiththe lord god i will seek that which was lost and bring again that which wasdriven away and will bind up that which was broken and willstrengthen that which was sick but i will destroy the fat and thestrong i will feed them with judgment and as for you o my flock thus saith the lord god behold ijudge between cattle and cattle between the rams and the he goats seemeth it a small thing unto you to have eaten up the goodpasture but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of yourpastures and to have drunk of the deep waters but ye must foul theresidue with your feet   and as for my flock they eat thatwhich ye have trodden with your feet and they drink that which yehave fouled with your feet therefore thus saith the lord god unto them behold i even iwill judge between the fat cattle and between the lean cattle because ye have thrust with side and with shoulder and pushedall the diseased with your horns till ye have scattered them abroad therefore will i save my flock and they shall no more be aprey and i will judge between cattle and cattle and i will set up one shepherd over them and he shall feedthem even my servant david he shall feed them and he shall be theirshepherd and i the lord will be their god and my servant david a princeamong them i the lord have spoken it and i will make with them a covenant of peace and will causethe evil beasts to cease out of the land and they shall dwell safelyin the wilderness and sleep in the woods and i will make them and the places round about my hill ablessing and i will cause the shower to come down in his seasonthere shall be showers of blessing and the tree of the field shall yield her fruit and the earthshall yield her increase and they shall be safe in their land andshall know that i am the lord when i have broken the bands of theiryoke and delivered them out of the hand of those that servedthemselves of them and they shall no more be a prey to the heathen neither shallthe beast of the land devour them but they shall dwell safely andnone shall make them afraid and i will raise up for them a plant of renown and they shallbe no more consumed with hunger in the land neither bear the shame ofthe heathen any more thus shall they know that i the lord their god am with them andthat they even the house of israel are my people saith the lordgod and ye my flock the flock of my pasture are men and i am yourgod saith the lord god moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying  son ofman set thy face against mount seir and prophesy against it and say unto it thus saith the lord god behold o mount seir i amagainst thee and i will stretch out mine hand against thee and iwill make thee most desolate i will lay thy cities waste and thou shalt be desolate and thoushalt know that i am the lord because thou hast had a perpetual hatred and hast shed the bloodof the children of israel by the force of the sword in the time oftheir calamity in the time that their iniquity had an end therefore as i live saith the lord god i will prepare thee untoblood and blood shall pursue thee sith thou hast not hated bloodeven blood shall pursue thee thus will i make mount seir most desolate and cut off from ithim that passeth out and him that returneth and i will fill his mountains with his slain men in thy hillsand in thy valleys and in all thy rivers shall they fall that areslain with the sword i will make thee perpetual desolations and thy cities shall notreturn and ye shall know that i am the lord because thou hast said these two nations and these twocountries shall be mine and we will possess it whereas the lord wasthere  therefore as i live saith the lord god i will even doaccording to thine anger and according to thine envy which thou hastused out of thy hatred against them and i will make myself knownamong them when i have judged thee and thou shalt know that i am the lord and that i have heardall thy blasphemies which thou hast spoken against the mountains ofisrael saying they are laid desolate they are given us to consume thus with your mouth ye have boasted against me and havemultiplied your words against me i have heard them thus saith the lord god when the whole earth rejoiceth i willmake thee desolate as thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the house of israelbecause it was desolate so will i do unto thee thou shalt bedesolate o mount seir and all idumea even all of it and they shallknow that i am the lord also thou son of man prophesy unto the mountains of israel andsay ye mountains of israel hear the word of the lord  thussaith the lord god because the enemy hath said against you aha eventhe ancient high places are ours in possession  thereforeprophesy and say thus saith the lord god because they have made youdesolate and swallowed you up on every side that ye might be apossession unto the residue of the heathen and ye are taken up in thelips of talkers and are an infamy of the people  therefore yemountains of israel hear the word of the lord god thus saith thelord god to the mountains and to the hills to the rivers and to thevalleys to the desolate wastes and to the cities that are forsakenwhich became a prey and derision to the residue of the heathen thatare round about  therefore thus saith the lord god surely in thefire of my jealousy have i spoken against the residue of the heathenand against all idumea which have appointed my land into theirpossession with the joy of all their heart with despiteful minds tocast it out for a prey prophesy therefore concerning the land of israel and say untothe mountains and to the hills to the rivers and to the valleysthus saith the lord god behold i have spoken in my jealousy and inmy fury because ye have borne the shame of the heathen therefore thus saith the lord god i have lifted up mine hand surelythe heathen that are about you they shall bear their shame but ye o mountains of israel ye shall shoot forth yourbranches and yield your fruit to my people of israel for they are athand to come for behold i am for you and i will turn unto you and ye shallbe tilled and sown  and i will multiply men upon you all thehouse of israel even all of it and the cities shall be inhabitedand the wastes shall be builded  and i will multiply upon youman and beast and they shall increase and bring fruit and i willsettle you after your old estates and will do better unto you than atyour beginnings and ye shall know that i am the lord yea i will cause men to walk upon you even my people israeland they shall possess thee and thou shalt be their inheritance andthou shalt no more henceforth bereave them of men thus saith the lord god because they say unto you thou landdevourest up men and hast bereaved thy nations  therefore thoushalt devour men no more neither bereave thy nations any more saiththe lord god neither will i cause men to hear in thee the shame of theheathen any more neither shalt thou bear the reproach of the peopleany more neither shalt thou cause thy nations to fall any more saiththe lord god moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying  son ofman when the house of israel dwelt in their own land they defiled itby their own way and by their doings their way was before me as theuncleanness of a removed woman wherefore i poured my fury upon them for the blood that they hadshed upon the land and for their idols wherewith they had pollutedit  and i scattered them among the heathen and they weredispersed through the countries according to their way and accordingto their doings i judged them and when they entered unto the heathen whither they went theyprofaned my holy name when they said to them these are the people ofthe lord and are gone forth out of his land but i had pity for mine holy name which the house of israel hadprofaned among the heathen whither they went therefore say unto the house of israel thus saith the lord godi do not this for your sakes o house of israel but for mine holynames sake which ye have profaned among the heathen whither yewent and i will sanctify my great name which was profaned among theheathen which ye have profaned in the midst of them and the heathenshall know that i am the lord saith the lord god when i shall besanctified in you before their eyes for i will take you from among the heathen and gather you outof all countries and will bring you into your own land then will i sprinkle clean water upon you and ye shall beclean from all your filthiness and from all your idols will icleanse you a new heart also will i give you and a new spirit will i putwithin you and i will take away the stony heart out of your fleshand i will give you an heart of flesh and i will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in mystatutes and ye shall keep my judgments and do them and ye shall dwell in the land that i gave to your fathers andye shall be my people and i will be your god i will also save you from all your uncleannesses and i willcall for the corn and will increase it and lay no famine upon you and i will multiply the fruit of the tree and the increase ofthe field that ye shall receive no more reproach of famine among theheathen then shall ye remember your own evil ways and your doings thatwere not good and shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for youriniquities and for your abominations not for your sakes do i this saith the lord god be it knownunto you be ashamed and confounded for your own ways o house ofisrael thus saith the lord god in the day that i shall have cleansedyou from all your iniquities i will also cause you to dwell in thecities and the wastes shall be builded and the desolate land shall be tilled whereas it lay desolatein the sight of all that passed by and they shall say this land that was desolate is become likethe garden of eden and the waste and desolate and ruined cities arebecome fenced and are inhabited then the heathen that are left round about you shall know that ithe lord build the ruined places and plant that that was desolate ithe lord have spoken it and i will do it thus saith the lord god i will yet for this be enquired of bythe house of israel to do it for them i will increase them with menlike a flock as the holy flock as the flock of jerusalem in her solemnfeasts so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men andthey shall know that i am the lord the hand of the lord was upon me and carried me out in thespirit of the lord and set me down in the midst of the valley whichwas full of bones  and caused me to pass by them round aboutand behold there were very many in the open valley and lo theywere very dry and he said unto me son of man can these bones live and ianswered o lord god thou knowest again he said unto me prophesy upon these bones and say untothem o ye dry bones hear the word of the lord thus saith the lord god unto these bones behold i will causebreath to enter into you and ye shall live  and i will laysinews upon you and will bring up flesh upon you and cover you withskin and put breath in you and ye shall live and ye shall know thati am the lord so i prophesied as i was commanded and as i prophesied therewas a noise and behold a shaking and the bones came together boneto his bone and when i beheld lo the sinews and the flesh came up uponthem and the skin covered them above but there was no breath inthem then said he unto me prophesy unto the wind prophesy son ofman and say to the wind thus saith the lord god come from the fourwinds o breath and breathe upon these slain that they may live so i prophesied as he commanded me and the breath came intothem and they lived and stood up upon their feet an exceeding greatarmy then he said unto me son of man these bones are the wholehouse of israel behold they say our bones are dried and our hopeis lost we are cut off for our parts therefore prophesy and say unto them thus saith the lord godbehold o my people i will open your graves and cause you to come upout of your graves and bring you into the land of israel and ye shall know that i am the lord when i have opened yourgraves o my people and brought you up out of your graves  andshall put my spirit in you and ye shall live and i shall place youin your own land then shall ye know that i the lord have spoken itand performed it saith the lord the word of the lord came again unto me saying  moreoverthou son of man take thee one stick and write upon it for judahand for the children of israel his companions then take anotherstick and write upon it for joseph the stick of ephraim and for allthe house of israel his companions  and join them one to anotherinto one stick and they shall become one in thine hand and when the children of thy people shall speak unto theesaying wilt thou not shew us what thou meanest by these   sayunto them thus saith the lord god behold i will take the stick ofjoseph which is in the hand of ephraim and the tribes of israel hisfellows and will put them with him even with the stick of judah andmake them one stick and they shall be one in mine hand and the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thine handbefore their eyes and say unto them thus saith the lord god behold i will takethe children of israel from among the heathen whither they be goneand will gather them on every side and bring them into their ownland  and i will make them one nation in the land upon themountains of israel and one king shall be king to them all and theyshall be no more two nations neither shall they be divided into twokingdoms any more at all neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idolsnor with their detestable things nor with any of theirtransgressions but i will save them out of all their dwellingplaceswherein they have sinned and will cleanse them so shall they be mypeople and i will be their god and david my servant shall be king over them and they all shallhave one shepherd they shall also walk in my judgments and observemy statutes and do them and they shall dwell in the land that i have given unto jacob myservant wherein your fathers have dwelt and they shall dwelltherein even they and their children and their childrens childrenfor ever and my servant david shall be their prince for ever moreover i will make a covenant of peace with them it

the reign of jehoiakim king of judah camenebuchadnezzar king of babylon unto jerusalem and besieged it and the lord gave jehoiakim king of judah into his hand with partof the vessels of the house of god which he carried into the land ofshinar to the house of his god and he brought the vessels into thetreasure house of his god and the king spake unto ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs thathe should bring certain of the children of israel and of the kingsseed and of the princes  children in whom was no blemish butwell favoured and skilful in all wisdom and cunning in knowledgeand understanding science and such as had ability in them to stand inthe kings palace and whom they might teach the learning and thetongue of the chaldeans and the king appointed them a daily provision of the kings meatand of the wine which he drank so nourishing them three years thatat the end thereof they might stand before the king now among these were of the children of judah daniel hananiahmishael and azariah  unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gavenames for he gave unto daniel the name of belteshazzar and tohananiah of shadrach and to mishael of meshach and to azariah ofabednego but daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himselfwith the portion of the kings meat nor with the wine which he dranktherefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might notdefile himself now god had brought daniel into favour and tender love with theprince of the eunuchs and the prince of the eunuchs said unto daniel i fear my lordthe king who hath appointed your meat and your drink for why shouldhe see your faces worse liking than the children which are of yoursort then shall ye make me endanger my head to the king then said daniel to melzar whom the prince of the eunuchs hadset over daniel hananiah mishael and azariah  prove thyservants i beseech thee ten days and let them give us pulse to eatand water to drink then let our countenances be looked upon before thee and thecountenance of the children that eat of the portion of the kingsmeat and as thou seest deal with thy servants so he consented to them in this matter and proved them ten days and at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer andfatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of thekings meat thus melzar took away the portion of their meat and the winethat they should drink and gave them pulse as for these four children god gave them knowledge and skill inall learning and wisdom and daniel had understanding in all visionsand dreams now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bringthem in then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in beforenebuchadnezzar and the king communed with them and among them all was foundnone like daniel hananiah mishael and azariah therefore stood theybefore the king and in all matters of wisdom and understanding that the kingenquired of them he found them ten times better than all themagicians and astrologers that were in all his realm and daniel continued even unto the first year of king cyrus and in the second year of the reign of nebuchadnezzarnebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams wherewith his spirit was troubled andhis sleep brake from him then the king commanded to call the magicians and theastrologers and the sorcerers and the chaldeans for to shew theking his dreams so they came and stood before the king and the king said unto them i have dreamed a dream and my spiritwas troubled to know the dream then spake the chaldeans to the king in syriack o king live forever tell thy servants the dream and we will shew theinterpretation the king answered and said to the chaldeans the thing is gonefrom me if ye will not make known unto me the dream with theinterpretation thereof ye shall be cut in pieces and your housesshall be made a dunghill but if ye shew the dream and the interpretation thereof ye shallreceive of me gifts and rewards and great honour therefore shew methe dream and the interpretation thereof they answered again and said let the king tell his servants thedream and we will shew the interpretation of it the king answered and said i know of certainty that ye would gainthe time because ye see the thing is gone from me but if ye will not make known unto me the dream there is but onedecree for you for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speakbefore me till the time be changed therefore tell me the dream andi shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof the chaldeans answered before the king and said there is not aman upon the earth that can shew the kings matter therefore there isno king lord nor ruler that asked such things at any magician orastrologer or chaldean and it is a rare thing that the king requireth and there is noneother that can shew it before the king except the gods whosedwelling is not with flesh for this cause the king was angry and very furious and commandedto destroy all the wise men of babylon and the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain andthey sought daniel and his fellows to be slain then daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to arioch thecaptain of the kings guard which was gone forth to slay the wise menof babylon  he answered and said to arioch the kings captainwhy is the decree so hasty from the king then arioch made the thingknown to daniel then daniel went in and desired of the king that he would givehim time and that he would shew the king the interpretation then daniel went to his house and made the thing known tohananiah mishael and azariah his companions  that they woulddesire mercies of the god of heaven concerning this secret thatdaniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise menof babylon then was the secret revealed unto daniel in a night vision thendaniel blessed the god of heaven daniel answered and said blessed be the name of god for ever andever for wisdom and might are his  and he changeth the times andthe seasons he removeth kings and setteth up kings he giveth wisdomunto the wise and knowledge to them that know understanding  herevealeth the deep and secret things he knoweth what is in thedarkness and the light dwelleth with him i thank thee and praise thee o thou god of my fathers who hastgiven me wisdom and might and hast made known unto me now what wedesired of thee for thou hast now made known unto us the kingsmatter therefore daniel went in unto arioch whom the king had ordainedto destroy the wise men of babylon he went and said thus unto himdestroy not the wise men of babylon bring me in before the king andi will shew unto the king the interpretation then arioch brought in daniel before the king in haste and saidthus unto him i have found a man of the captives of judah that willmake known unto the king the interpretation the king answered and said to daniel whose name wasbelteshazzar art thou able to make known unto me the dream which ihave seen and the interpretation thereof   daniel answered inthe presence of the king and said the secret which the king hathdemanded cannot the wise men the astrologers the magicians thesoothsayers shew unto the king  but there is a god in heaventhat revealeth secrets and maketh known to the king nebuchadnezzarwhat shall be in the latter days thy dream and the visions of thyhead upon thy bed are these  as for thee o king thy thoughtscame into thy mind upon thy bed what should come to pass hereafterand he that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come topass but as for me this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdomthat i have more than any living but for their sakes that shall makeknown the interpretation to the king and that thou mightest know thethoughts of thy heart thou o king sawest and behold a great image this great imagewhose brightness was excellent stood before thee and the formthereof was terrible this images head was of fine gold his breast and his arms ofsilver his belly and his thighs of brass  his legs of iron hisfeet part of iron and part of clay thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands whichsmote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay and brakethem to pieces then was the iron the clay the brass the silver and the goldbroken to pieces together and became like the chaff of the summerthreshingfloors and the wind carried them away that no place wasfound for them and the stone that smote the image became a greatmountain and filled the whole earth this is the dream and we will tell the interpretation thereofbefore the king thou o king art a king of kings for the god of heaven hathgiven thee a kingdom power and strength and glory and wheresoever the children of men dwell the beasts of thefield and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand andhath made thee ruler over them all thou art this head of gold and after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee andanother third kingdom of brass which shall bear rule over all theearth and the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron forasmuch as ironbreaketh in pieces and subdueth all things and as iron that breakethall these shall it break in pieces and bruise and whereas thou sawest the feet and toes part of potters clayand part of iron the kingdom shall be divided but there shall be init of the strength of the iron forasmuch as thou sawest the ironmixed with miry clay and as the toes of the feet were part of iron and part of clayso the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly broken and whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay they shallmingle themselves with the seed of men but they shall not cleave oneto another even as iron is not mixed with clay and in the days of these kings shall the god of heaven set up akingdom which shall never be destroyed and the kingdom shall not beleft to other people but it shall break in pieces and consume allthese kingdoms and it shall stand for ever forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of themountain without hands and that it brake in pieces the iron thebrass the clay the silver and the gold the great god hath madeknown to the king what shall come to pass hereafter and the dream iscertain and the interpretation thereof sure then the king nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face and worshippeddaniel and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweetodours unto him the king answered unto daniel and said of a truth it is thatyour god is a god of gods and a lord of kings and a revealer ofsecrets seeing thou couldest reveal this secret then the king made daniel a great man and gave him many greatgifts and made him ruler over the whole province of babylon andchief of the governors over all the wise men of babylon then daniel requested of the king and he set shadrach meshachand abednego over the affairs of the province of babylon but danielsat in the gate of the king nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold whose height wasthreescore cubits and the breadth thereof six cubits he set it up inthe plain of dura in the province of babylon then nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princesthe governors and the captains the judges the treasurers thecounsellors the sheriffs and all the rulers of the provinces tocome to the dedication of the image which nebuchadnezzar the king hadset up then the princes the governors and captains the judges thetreasurers the counsellors the sheriffs and all the rulers of theprovinces were gathered together unto the dedication of the imagethat nebuchadnezzar the king had set up and they stood before theimage that nebuchadnezzar had set up then an herald cried aloud to you it is commanded o peoplenations and languages  that at what time ye hear the sound of thecornet flute harp sackbut psaltery dulcimer and all kinds ofmusick ye fall down and worship the golden image that nebuchadnezzarthe king hath set up  and whoso falleth not down and worshippethshall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace therefore at that time when all the people heard the sound of thecornet flute harp sackbut psaltery and all kinds of musick allthe people the nations and the languages fell down and worshippedthe golden image that nebuchadnezzar the king had set up wherefore at that time certain chaldeans came near and accusedthe jews they spake and said to the king nebuchadnezzar o king live forever thou o king hast made a decree that every man that shall hearthe sound of the cornet flute harp sackbut psaltery and dulcimerand all kinds of musick shall fall down and worship the golden image and whoso falleth not down and worshippeth that he should becast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace there are certain jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of theprovince of babylon shadrach meshach and abednego these men oking have not regarded thee they serve not thy gods nor worship thegolden image which thou hast set up then nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bringshadrach meshach and abednego then they brought these men beforethe king nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them is it true o shadrachmeshach and abednego do not ye serve my gods nor worship the goldenimage which i have set up   now if ye be ready that at what timeye hear the sound of the cornet flute harp sackbut psaltery anddulcimer and all kinds of musick ye fall down and worship the imagewhich i have made well but if ye worship not ye shall be cast thesame hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace and who is thatgod that shall deliver you out of my hands   shadrach meshachand abednego answered and said to the king o nebuchadnezzar we arenot careful to answer thee in this matter if it be so our god whom we serve is able to deliver us from theburning fiery furnace and he will deliver us out of thine hand oking but if not be it known unto thee o king that we will not servethy gods nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up then was nebuchadnezzar full of fury and the form of his visagewas changed against shadrach meshach and abednego therefore hespake and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven timesmore than it was wont to be heated and he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army tobind shadrach meshach and abednego and to cast them into theburning fiery furnace then these men were bound in their coats their hosen and theirhats and their other garments and were cast into the midst of theburning fiery furnace therefore because the kings commandment was urgent and thefurnace exceeding hot the flames of the fire slew those men that tookup shadrach meshach and abednego and these three men shadrach meshach and abednego fell downbound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace then nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied and rose up in hasteand spake and said unto his counsellors did not we cast three menbound into the midst of the fire they answered and said unto theking true o king he answered and said lo i see four men loose walking in themidst of the fire and they have no hurt and the form of the fourthis like the son of god then nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fieryfurnace and spake and said shadrach meshach and abednego yeservants of the most high god come forth and come hither thenshadrach meshach and abednego came forth of the midst of the fire and the princes governors and captains and the kingscounsellors being gathered together saw these men upon whose bodiesthe fire had no power nor was an hair of their head singed neitherwere their coats changed nor the smell of fire had passed on them then nebuchadnezzar spake and said blessed be the god ofshadrach meshach and abednego who hath sent his angel anddelivered his servants that trusted in him and have changed thekings word and yielded their bodies that they might not serve norworship any god except their own god therefore i make a decree that every people nation andlanguage which speak any thing amiss against the god of shadrachmeshach and abednego shall be cut in pieces and their houses shallbe made a dunghill because there is no other god that can deliverafter this sort then the king promoted shadrach meshach and abednego in theprovince of babylon nebuchadnezzar the king unto all people nations and languagesthat dwell in all the earth peace be multiplied unto you i thought it good to shew the signs and wonders that the high godhath wrought toward me how great are his signs and how mighty are his wonders hiskingdom is an everlasting kingdom and his dominion is from generationto generation i nebuchadnezzar was at rest in mine house and flourishing in mypalace  i saw a dream which made me afraid and the thoughts uponmy bed and the visions of my head troubled me therefore made i a decree to bring in all the wise men of babylonbefore me that they might make known unto me the interpretation ofthe dream then came in the magicians the astrologers the chaldeans andthe soothsayers and i told the dream before them but they did notmake known unto me the interpretation thereof but at the last daniel came in before me whose name wasbelteshazzar according to the name of my god and in whom is thespirit of the holy gods and before him i told the dream saying o belteshazzar master of the magicians because i know that thespirit of the holy gods is in thee and no secret troubleth thee tellme the visions of my dream that i have seen and the interpretationthereof thus were the visions of mine head in my bed i saw and behold atree in the midst of the earth and the height thereof was great the tree grew and was strong and the height thereof reachedunto heaven and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth the leaves thereof were fair and the fruit thereof much and in itwas meat for all the beasts of the field had shadow under it and thefowls of the heaven dwelt in the boughs thereof and all flesh was fedof it i saw in the visions of my head upon my bed and behold awatcher and an holy one came down from heaven  he cried aloudand said thus hew down the tree and cut off his branches shake offhis leaves and scatter his fruit let the beasts get away from underit and the fowls from his branches  nevertheless leave the stumpof his roots in the earth even with a band of iron and brass in thetender grass of the field and let it be wet with the dew of heavenand let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth let his heart be changed from mans and let a beasts heart be givenunto him and let seven times pass over him this matter is by the decree of the watchers and the demand bythe word of the holy ones to the intent that the living may know thatthe most high ruleth in the kingdom of men and giveth it towhomsoever he will and setteth up over it the basest of men this dream i king nebuchadnezzar have seen now thou obelteshazzar declare the interpretation thereof forasmuch as all thewise men of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me theinterpretation but thou art able for the spirit of the holy gods isin thee then daniel whose name was belteshazzar was astonied for onehour and his thoughts troubled him the king spake and saidbelteshazzar let not the dream or the interpretation thereoftrouble thee belteshazzar answered and said my lord the dream be tothem that hate thee and the interpretation thereof to thine enemies the tree that thou sawest which grew and was strong whoseheight reached unto the heaven and the sight thereof to all theearth  whose leaves were fair and the fruit thereof much and init was meat for all under which the beasts of the field dwelt andupon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation it is thou o king that art grown and become strong for thygreatness is grown and reacheth unto heaven and thy dominion to theend of the earth and whereas the king saw a watcher and an holy one coming downfrom heaven and saying hew the tree down and destroy it yet leavethe stump of the roots thereof in the earth even with a band of ironand brass in the tender grass of the field and let it be wet withthe dew of heaven and let his portion be with the beasts of thefield till seven times pass over him  this is theinterpretation o king and this is the decree of the most high whichis come upon my lord the king  that they shall drive thee frommen and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field and theyshall make thee to eat grass as oxen and they shall wet thee with thedew of heaven and seven times shall pass over thee till thou knowthat the most high ruleth in the kingdom of men and giveth it towhomsoever he will and whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree rootsthy kingdom shall be sure unto thee after that thou shalt have knownthat the heavens do rule wherefore o king let my counsel be acceptable unto thee andbreak off thy sins by righteousness and thine iniquities by shewingmercy to the poor if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity all this came upon the king nebuchadnezzar at the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of thekingdom of babylon the king spake and said is not this great babylon that i havebuilt for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power and forthe honour of my majesty   while the word was in the kingsmouth there fell a voice from heaven saying o king nebuchadnezzarto thee it is spoken the kingdom is departed from thee and they shall drive thee from men and thy dwelling shall bewith the beasts of the field they shall make thee to eat grass asoxen and seven times shall pass over thee until thou know that themost high ruleth in the kingdom of men and giveth it to whomsoever hewill the same hour was the thing fulfilled upon nebuchadnezzar and hewas driven from men and did eat grass as oxen and his body was wetwith the dew of heaven till his hairs were grown like eaglesfeathers and his nails like birds claws and at the end of the days i nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyesunto heaven and mine understanding returned unto me and i blessedthe most high and i praised and honoured him that liveth for everwhose dominion is an everlasting dominion and his kingdom is fromgeneration to generation  and all the inhabitants of the earthare reputed as nothing and he doeth according to his will in the armyof heaven and among the inhabitants of the earth and none can stayhis hand or say unto him what doest thou   at the same time myreason returned unto me and for the glory of my kingdom mine honourand brightness returned unto me and my counsellors and my lordssought unto me and i was established in my kingdom and excellentmajesty was added unto me now i nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the king ofheaven all whose works are truth and his ways judgment and thosethat walk in pride he is able to abase belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lordsand drank wine before the thousand belshazzar whiles he tasted the wine commanded to bring thegolden and silver vessels which his father nebuchadnezzar had takenout of the temple which was in jerusalem that the king and hisprinces his wives and his concubines might drink therein then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of thetemple of the house of god which was at jerusalem and the king andhis princes his wives and his concubines drank in them they drank wine and praised the gods of gold and of silver ofbrass of iron of wood and of stone in the same hour came forth fingers of a mans hand and wroteover against the candlestick upon the plaister of the wall of thekings palace and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote then the kings countenance was changed and his thoughts troubledhim so that the joints of his loins were loosed and his knees smoteone against another the king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers the chaldeansand the soothsayers and the king spake and said to the wise men ofbabylon whosoever shall read this writing and shew me theinterpretation thereof shall be clothed with scarlet and have achain of gold about his neck and shall be the third ruler in thekingdom then came in all the kings wise men but they could not read thewriting nor make known to the king the interpretation thereof then was king belshazzar greatly troubled and his countenance waschanged in him and his lords were astonied now the queen by reason of the words of the king and his lordscame into the banquet house and the queen spake and said o kinglive for ever let not thy thoughts trouble thee nor let thycountenance be changed  there is a man in thy kingdom in whom isthe spirit of the holy gods and in the days of thy father light andunderstanding and wisdom like the wisdom of the gods was found inhim whom the king nebuchadnezzar thy father the king i say thyfather made master of the magicians astrologers chaldeans andsoothsayers  forasmuch as an excellent spirit and knowledge andunderstanding interpreting of dreams and shewing of hard sentencesand dissolving of doubts were found in the same daniel whom the kingnamed belteshazzar now let daniel be called and he will shew theinterpretation then was daniel brought in before the king and the king spakeand said unto daniel art thou that daniel which art of the childrenof the captivity of judah whom the king my father brought out ofjewry   i have even heard of thee that the spirit of the gods isin thee and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom isfound in thee and now the wise men the astrologers have been brought inbefore me that they should read this writing and make known unto methe interpretation thereof but they could not shew the interpretationof the thing  and i have heard of thee that thou canst makeinterpretations and dissolve doubts now if thou canst read thewriting and make known to me the interpretation thereof thou shaltbe clothed with scarlet and have a chain of gold about thy neck andshalt be the third ruler in the kingdom then daniel answered and said before the king let thy gifts beto thyself and give thy rewards to another yet i will read thewriting unto the king and make known to him the interpretation o thou king the most high god gave nebuchadnezzar thy father akingdom and majesty and glory and honour  and for the majestythat he gave him all people nations and languages trembled andfeared before him whom he would he slew and whom he would he keptalive and whom he would he set up and whom he would he put down but when his heart was lifted up and his mind hardened in pridehe was deposed from his kingly throne and they took his glory fromhim  and he was driven from the sons of men and his heart wasmade like the beasts and his dwelling was with the wild asses theyfed him with grass like oxen and his body was wet with the dew ofheaven till he knew that the most high god ruled in the kingdom ofmen and that he appointeth over it whomsoever he will and thou his son o belshazzar hast not humbled thine heartthough thou knewest all this  but hast lifted up thyself againstthe lord of heaven and they have brought the vessels of his housebefore thee and thou and thy lords thy wives and thy concubineshave drunk wine in them and thou hast praised the gods of silver andgold of brass iron wood and stone which see not nor hear norknow and the god in whose hand thy breath is and whose are all thyways hast thou not glorified  then was the part of the hand sentfrom him and this writing was written and this is the writing that was written mene mene tekelupharsin this is the interpretation of the thing mene god hath numberedthy kingdom and finished it tekel thou art weighed in the balances and art found wanting peres thy kingdom is divided and given to the medes andpersians then commanded belshazzar and they clothed daniel with scarletand put a chain of gold about his neck and made a proclamationconcerning him that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom in that night was belshazzar the king of the chaldeans slain and darius the median took the kingdom being about threescoreand two years old it pleased darius to set over the kingdom an hundred and twentyprinces which should be over the whole kingdom  and over thesethree presidents of whom daniel was first that the princes mightgive accounts unto them and the king should have no damage then this daniel was preferred above the presidents and princesbecause an excellent spirit was in him and the king thought to sethim over the whole realm then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion againstdaniel concerning the kingdom but they could find none occasion norfault forasmuch as he was faithful neither was there any error orfault found in him then said these men we shall not find any occasion against thisdaniel except we find it against him concerning the law of his god then these presidents and princes assembled together to the kingand said thus unto him king darius live for ever all the presidents of the kingdom the governors and the princesthe counsellors and the captains have consulted together toestablish a royal statute and to make a firm decree that whosoevershall ask a petition of any god or man for thirty days save of theeo king he shall be cast into the den of lions now o king establish the decree and sign the writing that itbe not changed according to the law of the medes and persians whichaltereth not wherefore king darius signed the writing and the decree now when daniel knew that the writing was signed he went intohis house and his windows being open in his chamber toward jerusalemhe kneeled upon his knees three times a day and prayed and gavethanks before his god as he did aforetime then these men assembled and found daniel praying and makingsupplication before his god then they came near and spake before the king concerning thekings decree hast thou not signed a decree that every man thatshall ask a petition of any god or man within thirty days save ofthee o king shall be cast into the den of lions the king answeredand said the thing is true according to the law of the medes andpersians which altereth not then answered they and said before the king that daniel whichis of the children of the captivity of judah regardeth not thee oking nor the decree that thou hast signed but maketh his petitionthree times a day then the king when he heard these words was sore displeasedwith himself and set his heart on daniel to deliver him and helaboured till the going down of the sun to deliver him then these men assembled unto the king and said unto the kingknow o king that the law of the medes and persians is that nodecree nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed then the king commanded and they brought daniel and cast himinto the den of lions now the king spake and said unto daniel thygod whom thou servest continually he will deliver thee and a stone was brought and laid upon the mouth of the den andthe king sealed it with his own signet and with the signet of hislords that the purpose might not be changed concerning daniel then the king went to his palace and passed the night fastingneither were instruments of musick brought before him and his sleepwent from him then the king arose very early in the morning and went in hasteunto the den of lions and when he came to the den he cried with a lamentable voiceunto daniel and the king spake and said to daniel o daniel servantof the living god is thy god whom thou servest continually able todeliver thee from the lions   then said daniel unto the king oking live for ever my god hath sent his angel and hath shut the lions mouths thatthey have not hurt me forasmuch as before him innocency was found inme and also before thee o king have i done no hurt then was the king exceedingly glad for him and commanded thatthey should take daniel up out of the den so daniel was taken up outof the den and no manner of hurt was found upon him because hebelieved in his god and the king commanded and they brought those men which hadaccused daniel and they cast them into the den of lions them theirchildren and their wives and the lions had the mastery of them andbrake all their bones in pieces or ever they came at the bottom of theden then king darius wrote unto all people nations and languagesthat dwell in all the earth peace be multiplied unto you i make a decree that in every dominion of my kingdom men trembleand fear before the god of daniel for he is the living god andstedfast for ever and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyedand his dominion shall be even unto the end he delivereth and rescueth and he worketh signs and wonders inheaven and in earth who hath delivered daniel from the power of thelions so this daniel prospered in the reign of darius and in the reignof cyrus the persian in the first year of belshazzar king of babylon daniel had a dreamand visions of his head upon his bed then he wrote the dream andtold the sum of the matters daniel spake and said i saw in my vision by night and beholdthe four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea and four great beasts came up from the sea diverse one fromanother the first was like a lion and had eagles wings i beheld tillthe wings thereof were plucked and it was lifted up from the earthand made stand upon the feet as a man and a mans heart was given toit and behold another beast a second like to a bear and it raisedup itself on one side and it had three ribs in the mouth of itbetween the teeth of it and they said thus unto it arise devourmuch flesh after this i beheld and lo another like a leopard which hadupon the back of it four wings of a fowl the beast had also fourheads and dominion was given to it after this i saw in the night visions and behold a fourth beastdreadful and terrible and strong exceedingly and it had great ironteeth it devoured and brake in pieces and stamped the residue withthe feet of it and it was diverse from all the beasts that werebefore it and it had ten horns i considered the horns and behold there came up among themanother little horn before whom there were three of the first hornsplucked up by the roots and behold in this horn were eyes like theeyes of man and a mouth speaking great things i beheld till the thrones were cast down and the ancient of daysdid sit whose garment was white as snow and the hair of his headlike the pure wool his throne was like the fiery flame and hiswheels as burning fire a fiery stream issued and came forth from before him thousandthousands ministered unto him and ten thousand times ten thousandstood before him the judgment was set and the books were opened i beheld then because of the voice of the great words which thehorn spake i beheld even till the beast was slain and his bodydestroyed and given to the burning flame as concerning the rest of the beasts they had their dominiontaken away yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time i saw in the night visions and behold one like the son of mancame with the clouds of heaven and came to the ancient of days andthey brought him near before him and there was given him dominion and glory and a kingdom thatall people nations and languages should serve him his dominion isan everlasting dominion which shall not pass away and his kingdomthat which shall not be destroyed i daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body andthe visions of my head troubled me i came near unto one of them that stood by and asked him thetruth of all this so he told me and made me know the interpretationof the things these great beasts which are four are four kings which shallarise out of the earth but the saints of the most high shall take the kingdom andpossess the kingdom for ever even for ever and ever then i would know the truth of the fourth beast which wasdiverse from all the others exceeding dreadful whose teeth were ofiron and his nails of brass which devoured brake in pieces andstamped the residue with his feet  and of the ten horns that werein his head and of the other which came up and before whom threefell even of that horn that had eyes and a mouth that spake verygreat things whose look was more stout than his fellows i beheld and the same horn made war with the saints andprevailed against them  until the ancient of days came andjudgment was given to the saints of the most high and the time camethat the saints possessed the kingdom thus he said the fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom uponearth which shall be diverse from all kingdoms and shall devour thewhole earth and shall tread it down and break it in pieces and the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shallarise and another shall rise after them and he shall be diverse fromthe first and he shall subdue three kings and he shall speak great words against the most high and shallwear out the saints of the most high and think to change times andlaws and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times andthe dividing of time but the judgment shall sit and they shall take away hisdominion to consume and to destroy it unto the end and the kingdom and dominion and the greatness of the kingdomunder the whole heaven shall be given to the people of the saints ofthe most high whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom and alldominions shall serve and obey him hitherto is the end of the matter as for me daniel mycogitations much troubled me and my countenance changed in me but ikept the matter in my heart in the third year of the reign of king belshazzar a visionappeared unto me even unto me daniel after that which appeared untome at the first and i saw in a vision and it came to pass when i saw that i wasat shushan in the palace which is in the province of elam and i sawin a vision and i was by the river of ulai then i lifted up mine eyes and saw and behold there stoodbefore the river a ram which had two horns and the two horns werehigh but one was higher than the other and the higher came up last i saw the ram pushing westward and northward and southward sothat no beasts might stand before him neither was there any thatcould deliver out of his hand but he did according to his will andbecame great and as i was considering behold an he goat came from the west onthe face of the whole earth and touched not the ground and the goathad a notable horn between his eyes and he came to the ram that had two horns which i had seenstanding before the river and ran unto him in the fury of his power and i saw him come close unto the ram and he was moved withcholer against him and smote the ram and brake his two horns andthere was no power in the ram to stand before him but he cast himdown to the ground and stamped upon him and there was none thatcould deliver the ram out of his hand therefore the he goat waxed very great and when he was strongthe great horn was broken and for it came up four notable ones towardthe four winds of heaven and out of one of them came forth a little horn which waxedexceeding great toward the south and toward the east and toward thepleasant land and it waxed great even to the host of heaven and it cast downsome of the host and of the stars to the ground and stamped uponthem yea he magnified himself even to the prince of the host and byhim the daily sacrifice was taken away and the place of the sanctuarywas cast down and an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reasonof transgression and it cast down the truth to the ground and itpractised and prospered then i heard one saint speaking and another saint said unto thatcertain saint which spake how long shall be the vision concerning thedaily sacrifice and the transgression of desolation to give both thesanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot   and he saidunto me unto two thousand and three hundred days then shall thesanctuary be cleansed and it came to pass when i even i daniel had seen the visionand sought for the meaning then behold there stood before me as theappearance of a man and i heard a mans voice between the banks of ulai whichcalled and said gabriel make this man to understand the vision so he came near where i stood and when he came i was afraidand fell upon my face but he said unto me understand o son of manfor at the time of the end shall be the vision now as he was speaking with me i was in a deep sleep on my facetoward the ground but he touched me and set me upright and he said behold i will make thee know what shall be in thelast end of the indignation for at the time appointed the end shallbe the ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of mediaand persia and the rough goat is the king of grecia and the great horn thatis between his eyes is the first king now that being broken whereas four stood up for it fourkingdoms shall stand up out of the nation but not in his power and in the latter time of their kingdom when the transgressorsare come to the full a king of fierce countenance and understandingdark sentences shall stand up and his power shall be mighty but not by his own power and heshall destroy wonderfully and shall prosper and practise and shalldestroy the mighty and the holy people and through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper inhis hand and he shall magnify himself in his heart and by peaceshall destroy many he shall also stand up against the prince ofprinces but he shall be broken without hand and the vision of the evening and the morning which was told istrue wherefore shut thou up the vision for it shall be for manydays and i daniel fainted and was sick certain days afterward i roseup and did the kings business and i was astonished at the visionbut none understood it in the first year of darius the son of ahasuerus of the seed ofthe medes which was made king over the realm of the chaldeans  inthe first year of his reign i daniel understood by books the number ofthe years whereof the word of the lord came to jeremiah the prophetthat he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations ofjerusalem and i set my face unto the lord god to seek by prayer andsupplications with fasting and sackcloth and ashes  and iprayed unto the lord my god and made my confession and said o lordthe great and dreadful god keeping the covenant and mercy to themthat love him and to them that keep his commandments  we havesinned and have committed iniquity and have done wickedly and haverebelled even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets whichspake in thy name to our kings our princes and our fathers and toall the people of the land o lord righteousness belongeth unto thee but unto us confusionof faces as at this day to the men of judah and to the inhabitantsof jerusalem and unto all israel that are near and that are faroff through all the countries whither thou hast driven them becauseof their trespass that they have trespassed against thee o lord to us belongeth confusion of face to our kings to ourprinces and to our fathers because we have sinned against thee to the lord our god belong mercies and forgivenesses though wehave rebelled against him  neither have we obeyed the voice ofthe lord our god to walk in his laws which he set before us by hisservants the prophets yea all israel have transgressed thy law even by departingthat they might not obey thy voice therefore the curse is poured uponus and the oath that is written in the law of moses the servant ofgod because we have sinned against him and he hath confirmed his words which he spake against us andagainst our judges that judged us by bringing upon us a great evilfor under the whole heaven hath not been done as hath been done uponjerusalem as it is written in the law of moses all this evil is come uponus yet made we not our prayer before the lord our god that we mightturn from our iniquities and understand thy truth therefore hath the lord watched upon the evil and brought itupon us for the lord our god is righteous in all his works which hedoeth for we obeyed not his voice and now o lord our god that hast brought thy people forth outof the land of egypt with a mighty hand and hast gotten thee renownas at this day we have sinned we have done wickedly o lord according to all thy righteousness i beseech thee letthine anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city jerusalem thyholy mountain because for our sins and for the iniquities of ourfathers jerusalem and thy people are become a reproach to all thatare about us now therefore o our god hear the prayer of thy servant and hissupplications and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that isdesolate for the lords sake o my god incline thine ear and hear open thine eyes andbehold our desolations and the city which is called by thy name forwe do not present our supplications before thee for ourrighteousnesses but for thy great mercies o lord hear o lord forgive o lord hearken and do defer notfor thine own sake o my god for thy city and thy people are calledby thy name and whiles i was speaking and praying and confessing my sin andthe sin of my people israel and presenting my supplication before thelord my god for the holy mountain of my god  yea whiles i wasspeaking in prayer even the man gabriel whom i had seen in thevision at the beginning being caused to fly swiftly touched me aboutthe time of the evening oblation and he informed me and talked with me and said o daniel i amnow come forth to give thee skill and understanding at the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came forthand i am come to shew thee for thou art greatly beloved thereforeunderstand the matter and consider the vision seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holycity to finish the transgression and to make an end of sins and tomake reconciliation for iniquity and to bring in everlastingrighteousness and to seal up the vision and prophecy and to anointthe most holy know therefore and understand that from the going forth of thecommandment to restore and to build jerusalem unto the messiah theprince shall be seven weeks and threescore and two weeks the streetshall be built again and the wall even in troublous times and after threescore and two weeks shall messiah be cut off butnot for himself and the people of the prince that shall come shalldestroy the city and the sanctuary and the end thereof shall be witha flood and unto the end of the war desolations are determined and he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week and inthe midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation tocease and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make itdesolate even until the consummation and that determined shall bepoured upon the desolate in the third year of cyrus king of persia a thing was revealedunto daniel whose name was called belteshazzar and the thing wastrue but the time appointed was long and he understood the thingand had understanding of the vision in those days i daniel was mourning three full weeks i ate no pleasant bread neither came flesh nor wine in my mouthneither did i anoint myself at all till three whole weeks werefulfilled and in the four and twentieth day of the first month as i was bythe side of the great river which is hiddekel  then i lifted upmine eyes and looked and behold a certain man clothed in linenwhose loins were girded with fine gold of uphaz  his body alsowas like the beryl and his face as the appearance of lightning andhis eyes as lamps of fire and his arms and his feet like in colour topolished brass and the voice of his words like the voice of amultitude and i daniel alone saw the vision for the men that were with mesaw not the vision but a great quaking fell upon them so that theyfled to hide themselves therefore i was left alone and saw this great vision and thereremained no strength in me for my comeliness was turned in me intocorruption and i retained no strength yet heard i the voice of his words and when i heard the voice ofhis words then was i in a deep sleep on my face and my face towardthe ground and behold an hand touched me which set me upon my knees andupon the palms of my hands and he said unto me o daniel a man greatly beloved understandthe words that i speak unto thee and stand upright for unto thee ami now sentand when he had spoken this word unto me i stood trembling then said he unto me fear not daniel for from the first daythat thou didst set thine heart to understand and to chasten thyselfbefore thy god thy words were heard and i am come for thy words but the prince of the kingdom of persia withstood me one andtwenty days but lo michael one of the chief princes came to helpme and i remained there with the kings of persia now i am come to make thee understand what shall befall thypeople in the latter days for yet the vision is for many days and when he had spoken such words unto me i set my face towardthe ground and i became dumb and behold one like the similitude of the sons of men touchedmy lips then i opened my mouth and spake and said unto him thatstood before me o my lord by the vision my sorrows are turned uponme and i have retained no strength for how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lordfor as for me straightway there remained no strength in me neitheris there breath left in me then there came again and touched me one like the appearance ofa man and he strengthened me  and said o man greatly belovedfear not peace be unto thee be strong yea be strong and when hehad spoken unto me i was strengthened and said let my lord speakfor thou hast strengthened me then said he knowest thou wherefore i come unto thee and nowwill i return to fight with the prince of persia and when i am goneforth lo the prince of grecia shall come but i will shew thee that which is noted in the scripture oftruth and there is none that holdeth with me in these things butmichael your prince also i in the first year of darius the mede even i stood toconfirm and to strengthen him and now will i shew thee the truth behold there shall stand upyet three kings in persia and the fourth shall be far richer thanthey all and by his strength through his riches he shall stir up allagainst the realm of grecia and a mighty king shall stand up that shall rule with greatdominion and do according to his will and when he shall stand up his kingdom shall be broken andshall be divided toward the four winds of heaven and not to hisposterity nor according to his dominion which he ruled for hiskingdom shall be plucked up even for others beside those and the king of the south shall be strong and one of hisprinces and he shall be strong above him and have dominion hisdominion shall be a great dominion and in the end of years they shall join themselves together forthe kings daughter of the south shall come to the king of the northto make an agreement but she shall not retain the power of the armneither shall he stand nor his arm but she shall be given up andthey that brought her and he that begat her and he that strengthenedher in these times but out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up in hisestate which shall come with an army and shall enter into thefortress of the king of the north and shall deal against them andshall prevail  and shall also carry captives into egypt theirgods with their princes and with their precious vessels of silverand of gold and he shall continue more years than the king of thenorth so the king of the south shall come into his kingdom and shallreturn into his own land but his sons shall be stirred up and shall assemble a multitudeof great forces and one shall certainly come and overflow and passthrough then shall he return and be stirred up even to hisfortress and the king of the south shall be moved with choler and shallcome forth and fight with him even with the king of the north and heshall set forth a great multitude but the multitude shall be giveninto his hand and when he hath taken away the multitude his heart shall belifted up and he shall cast down many ten thousands but he shall notbe strengthened by it for the king of the north shall return and shall set forth amultitude greater than the former and shall certainly come aftercertain years with a great army and with much riches and in those times there shall many stand up against the king ofthe south also the robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves toestablish the vision but they shall fall so the king of the north shall come and cast up a mount andtake the most fenced cities and the arms of the south shall notwithstand neither his chosen people neither shall there be anystrength to withstand but he that cometh against him shall do according to his ownwill and none shall stand before him and he shall stand in theglorious land which by his hand shall be consumed he shall also set his face to enter with the strength of hiswhole kingdom and upright ones with him thus shall he do and heshall give him the daughter of women corrupting her but she shallnot stand on his side neither be for him after this shall he turn his face unto the isles and shall takemany but a prince for his own behalf shall cause the reproach offeredby him to cease without his own reproach he shall cause it to turnupon him then he shall turn his face toward the fort of his own land buthe shall stumble and fall and not be found then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes in the gloryof the kingdom but within few days he shall be destroyed neither inanger nor in battle and in his estate shall stand up a vile person to whom theyshall not give the honour of the kingdom but he shall come inpeaceably and obtain the kingdom by flatteries and with the arms of a flood shall they be overflown from beforehim and shall be broken yea also the prince of the covenant and after the league made with him he shall work deceitfullyfor he shall come up and shall become strong with a small people he shall enter peaceably even upon the fattest places of theprovince and he shall do that which his fathers have not done norhis fathers fathers he shall scatter among them the prey and spoiland riches yea and he shall forecast his devices against the strongholds even for a time and he shall stir up his power and his courage against the kingof the south with a great army and the king of the south shall bestirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army but he shallnot stand for they shall forecast devices against him yea they that feed of the portion of his meat shall destroyhim and his army shall overflow and many shall fall down slain and both of these kings hearts shall be to do mischief andthey shall speak lies at one table but it shall not prosper for yetthe end shall be at the time appointed then shall he return into his land with great riches and hisheart shall be against the holy covenant and he shall do exploitsand return to his own land at the time appointed he shall return and come toward thesouth but it shall not be as the former or as the latter for the ships of chittim shall come against him therefore heshall be grieved and return and have indignation against the holycovenant so shall he do he shall even return and have intelligencewith them that forsake the holy covenant and arms shall stand on his part and they shall pollute thesanctuary of strength and shall take away the daily sacrifice andthey shall place the abomination that maketh desolate and such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt byflatteries but the people that do know their god shall be strong anddo exploits and they that understand among the people shall instruct manyyet they shall fall by the sword and by flame by captivity and byspoil many days now when they shall fall they shall be holpen with a littlehelp but many shall cleave to them with flatteries and some of them of understanding shall fall to try them andto purge and to make them white even to the time of the end becauseit is yet for a time appointed and the king shall do according to his will and he shall exalthimself and magnify himself above every god and shall speakmarvellous things against the god of gods and shall prosper till theindignation be accomplished for that that is determined shall bedone neither shall he regard the god of his fathers nor the desireof women nor regard any god for he shall magnify himself above all but in his estate shall he honour the god of forces and a godwhom his fathers knew not shall he honour with gold and silver andwith precious stones and pleasant things thus shall he do in the most strong holds with a strange godwhom he shall acknowledge and increase with glory and he shall causethem to rule over many and shall divide the land for gain and at the time of the end shall the king of the south push athim and the king of the north shall come against him like awhirlwind with chariots and with horsemen and with many ships andhe shall enter into the countries and shall overflow and pass over he shall enter also into the glorious land and many countriesshall be overthrown but these shall escape out of his hand evenedom and moab and the chief of the children of ammon he shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries and theland of egypt shall not escape but he shall have power over the treasures of gold and ofsilver and over all the precious things of egypt and the libyans andthe ethiopians shall be at his steps but tidings out of the east and out of the north shall troublehim therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy andutterly to make away many and he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between theseas in the glorious holy mountain yet he shall come to his end andnone shall help him and at that time shall michael stand up the great prince whichstandeth for the children of thy people and there shall be a time oftrouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that sametime and at that time thy people shall be delivered every one thatshall be found written in the book and many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awakesome to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting contempt and they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of thefirmament and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars forever and ever but thou o daniel shut up the words and seal the book even tothe time of the end many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall beincreased then i daniel looked and behold there stood other two the oneon this side of the bank of the river and the other on that side ofthe bank of the river and one said to the man clothed in linen which was upon thewaters of the river how long shall it be to the end of these wonders and i heard the man clothed in linen which was upon the watersof the river when he held up his right hand and his left hand untoheaven and sware by him that liveth for ever that it shall be for atime times and an half and when he shall have accomplished toscatter the power of the holy people all these things shall befinished and i heard but i understood not then said i o my lord whatshall be the end of these things   and he said go thy waydaniel for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of theend many shall be purified and made white and tried but thewicked shall do wickedly and none of the wicked shall understand butthe wise shall understand and from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken awayand the abomination that maketh desolate set up there shall be athousand two hundred and ninety days blessed is he that waiteth and cometh to the thousand threehundred and five and thirty days but go thou thy way till the end be for thou shalt restand stand in thy lot at the end of the dayshosea the word of the lord that came unto hosea the son of beeri inthe days of uzziah jotham ahaz and hezekiah kings of judah and inthe days of jeroboam the son of joash king of israel the beginning of the word of the lord by hosea and the lord saidto hosea go take unto thee a wife of whoredoms and children ofwhoredoms for the land hath committed great whoredom departing fromthe lord so he went and took gomer the daughter of diblaim whichconceived and bare him a son and the lord said unto him call his name jezreel for yet alittle while and i will avenge the blood of jezreel upon the house ofjehu and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of israel and it shall come to pass at that day that i will break the bowof israel in the valley of jezreel and she conceived again and bare a daughter and god said untohim call her name loruhamah for i will no more have mercy upon thehouse of israel but i will utterly take them away but i will have mercy upon the house of judah and will save themby the lord their god and will not save them by bow nor by swordnor by battle by horses nor by horsemen now when she had weaned loruhamah she conceived and bare a son then said god call his name loammi for ye are not my people andi will not be your god yet the number of the children of israel shall be as the sand ofthe sea which cannot be measured nor numbered and it shall come topass that in the place where it was said unto them ye are not mypeople there it shall be said unto them ye are the sons of theliving god then shall the children of judah and the children of israel begathered together and appoint themselves one head and they shallcome up out of the land for great shall be the day of jezreel say ye unto your brethren ammi and to your sisters ruhamah plead with your mother plead for she is not my wife neither ami her husband let her therefore put away her whoredoms out of hersight and her adulteries from between her breasts  lest i stripher naked and set her as in the day that she was born and make heras a wilderness and set her like a dry land and slay her withthirst and i will not have mercy upon her children for they be thechildren of whoredoms for their mother hath played the harlot she that conceived themhath done shamefully for she said i will go after my lovers thatgive me my bread and my water my wool and my flax mine oil and mydrink therefore behold i will hedge up thy way with thorns and make awall that she shall not find her paths and she shall follow after her lovers but she shall not overtakethem and she shall seek them but shall not find them then shall shesay i will go and return to my first husband for then was it betterwith me than now for she did not know that i gave her corn and wine and oil andmultiplied her silver and gold which they prepared for baal therefore will i return and take away my corn in the timethereof and my wine in the season thereof and will recover my wooland my flax given to cover her nakedness and now will i discover her lewdness in the sight of her loversand none shall deliver her out of mine hand i will also cause all her mirth to cease her feast days her newmoons and her sabbaths and all her solemn feasts and i will destroy her vines and her fig trees whereof she hathsaid these are my rewards that my lovers have given me and i willmake them a forest and the beasts of the field shall eat them and i will visit upon her the days of baalim wherein she burnedincense to them and she decked herself with her earrings and herjewels and she went after her lovers and forgat me saith the lord therefore behold i will allure her and bring her into thewilderness and speak comfortably unto her and i will give her her vineyards from thence and the valley ofachor for a door of hope and she shall sing there as in the days ofher youth and as in the day when she came up out of the land ofegypt and it shall be at that day saith the lord that thou shalt callme ishi and shalt call me no more baali for i will take away the names of baalim out of her mouth andthey shall no more be remembered by their name and in that day will i make a covenant for them with the beastsof the field and with the fowls of heaven and with the creepingthings of the ground and i will break the bow and the sword and thebattle out of the earth and will make them to lie down safely and i will betroth thee unto me for ever yea i will betroththee unto me in righteousness and in judgment and in lovingkindnessand in mercies i will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness and thou shaltknow the lord and it shall come to pass in that day i will hear saith thelord i will hear the heavens and they shall hear the earth  andthe earth shall hear the corn and the wine and the oil and theyshall hear jezreel and i will sow her unto me in the earth and i will have mercyupon her that had not obtained mercy and i will say to them whichwere not my people thou art my people and they shall say thou artmy god then said the lord unto me go yet love a woman beloved of herfriend yet an adulteress according to the love of the lord towardthe children of israel who look to other gods and love flagons ofwine so i bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver and for anhomer of barley and an half homer of barley  and i said unto herthou shalt abide for me many days thou shalt not play the harlot andthou shalt not be for another man so will i also be for thee for the children of israel shall abide many days without a kingand without a prince and without a sacrifice and without an imageand without an ephod and without teraphim  afterward shall thechildren of israel return and seek the lord their god and davidtheir king and shall fear the lord and his goodness in the latterdays hear the word of the lord ye children of israel for the lordhath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land because there isno truth nor mercy nor knowledge of god in the land by swearing and lying and killing and stealing and committingadultery they break out and blood toucheth blood therefore shall the land mourn and every one that dwelleththerein shall languish with the beasts of the field and with thefowls of heaven yea the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away yet let no man strive nor reprove another for thy people are asthey that strive with the priest therefore shalt thou fall in the day and the prophet also shallfall with thee in the night and i will destroy thy mother my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge because thou hastrejected knowledge i will also reject thee that thou shalt be nopriest to me seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy god i willalso forget thy children as they were increased so they sinned against me therefore willi change their glory into shame they eat up the sin of my people and they set their heart ontheir iniquity and there shall be like people like priest and i will punishthem for their ways and reward them their doings for they shall eat and not have enough they shall commitwhoredom and shall not increase because they have left off to takeheed to the lord whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart my people ask counsel at their stocks and their staff declarethunto them for the spirit of whoredoms hath caused them to err andthey have gone a whoring from under their god they sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains and burn incenseupon the hills under oaks and poplars and elms because the shadowthereof is good therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom andyour spouses shall commit adultery i will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom noryour spouses when they commit adultery for themselves are separatedwith whores and they sacrifice with harlots therefore the peoplethat doth not understand shall fall though thou israel play the harlot yet let not judah offendand come not ye unto gilgal neither go ye up to bethaven nor swearthe lord liveth for israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer now the lordwill feed them as a lamb in a large place ephraim is joined to idols let him alone their drink is sour they have committed whoredom continuallyher rulers with shame do love give ye the wind hath bound her up in her wings and they shall beashamed because of their sacrifices hear ye this o priests and hearken ye house of israel and giveye ear o house of the king for judgment is toward you because yehave been a snare on mizpah and a net spread upon tabor and the revolters are profound to make slaughter though i havebeen a rebuker of them all i know ephraim and israel is not hid from me for now o ephraimthou committest whoredom and israel is defiled they will not frame their doings to turn unto their god for thespirit of whoredoms is in the midst of them and they have not knownthe lord and the pride of israel doth testify to his face therefore shallisrael and ephraim fall in their iniquity judah also shall fall withthem they shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek thelord but they shall not find him he hath withdrawn himself fromthem they have dealt treacherously against the lord for they havebegotten strange children now shall a month devour them with theirportions blow ye the cornet in gibeah and the trumpet in ramah cry aloudat bethaven after thee o benjamin ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke among the tribesof israel have i made known that which shall surely be the princes of judah were like them that remove the boundtherefore i will pour out my wrath upon them like water ephraim is oppressed and broken in judgment because he willinglywalked after the commandment therefore will i be unto ephraim as a moth and to the house ofjudah as rottenness when ephraim saw his sickness and judah saw his wound then wentephraim to the assyrian and sent to king jareb yet could he not healyou nor cure you of your wound for i will be unto ephraim as a lion and as a young lion to thehouse of judah i even i will tear and go away i will take awayand none shall rescue him i will go and return to my place till they acknowledge theiroffence and seek my face in their affliction they will seek meearly come and let us return unto the lord for he hath torn and hewill heal us he hath smitten and he will bind us up after two days will he revive us in the third day he will raiseus up and we shall live in his sight then shall we know if we follow on to know the lord his goingforth is prepared as the morning and he shall come unto us as therain as the latter and former rain unto the earth o ephraim what shall i do unto thee o judah what shall i dounto thee for your goodness is as a morning cloud and as the earlydew it goeth away therefore have i hewed them by the prophets i have slain them bythe words of my mouth and thy judgments are as the light that goethforth for i desired mercy and not sacrifice and the knowledge of godmore than burnt offerings but they like men have transgressed the covenant there have theydealt treacherously against me gilead is a city of them that work iniquity and is polluted withblood and as troops of robbers wait for a man so the company of priestsmurder in the way by consent for they commit lewdness i have seen an horrible thing in the house of israel there isthe whoredom of ephraim israel is defiled also o judah he hath set an harvest for thee when i returnedthe captivity of my people when i would have healed israel then the iniquity of ephraim wasdiscovered and the wickedness of samaria for they commit falsehoodand the thief cometh in and the troop of robbers spoileth without and they consider not in their hearts that i remember all theirwickedness now their own doings have beset them about they arebefore my face they make the king glad with their wickedness and the princeswith their lies they are all adulterers as an oven heated by the baker whoceaseth from raising after he hath kneaded the dough until it beleavened in the day of our king the princes have made him sick with bottlesof wine he stretched out his hand with scorners for they have made ready their heart like an oven whiles they liein wait their baker sleepeth all the night in the morning it burnethas a flaming fire they are all hot as an oven and have devoured their judges alltheir kings are fallen there is none among them that calleth unto me ephraim he hath mixed himself among the people ephraim is a cakenot turned strangers have devoured his strength and he knoweth it not yeagray hairs are here and there upon him yet he knoweth not and the pride of israel testifieth to his face and they do notreturn to the lord their god nor seek him for all this ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart they call toegypt they go to assyria when they shall go i will spread my net upon them i will bringthem down as the fowls of the heaven i will chastise them as theircongregation hath heard woe unto them for they have fled from me destruction unto thembecause they have transgressed against me though i have redeemedthem yet they have spoken lies against me and they have not cried unto me with their heart when theyhowled upon their beds they assemble themselves for corn and wineand they rebel against me though i have bound and strengthened their arms yet do theyimagine mischief against me they return but not to the most high they are like a deceitfulbow their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of theirtongue this shall be their derision in the land of egypt set the trumpet to thy mouth he shall come as an eagle againstthe house of the lord because they have transgressed my covenant andtrespassed against my law israel shall cry unto me my god we know thee israel hath cast off the thing that is good the enemy shallpursue him they have set up kings but not by me they have made princes andi knew it not of their silver and their gold have they made themidols that they may be cut off thy calf o samaria hath cast thee off mine anger is kindledagainst them how long will it be ere they attain to innocency  for from israel was it also the workman made it therefore it is notgod but the calf of samaria shall be broken in pieces for they have sown the wind and they shall reap the whirlwind ithath no stalk the bud shall yield no meal if so be it yield thestrangers shall swallow it up israel is swallowed up now shall they be among the gentiles as avessel wherein is no pleasure for they are gone up to assyria a wild ass alone by himselfephraim hath hired lovers yea though they have hired among the nations now will i gatherthem and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king ofprinces because ephraim hath made many altars to sin altars shall beunto him to sin i have written to him the great things of my law but they werecounted as a strange thing they sacrifice flesh for the sacrifices of mine offerings andeat it but the lord accepteth them not now will he remember theiriniquity and visit their sins they shall return to egypt for israel hath forgotten his maker and buildeth temples andjudah hath multiplied fenced cities but i will send a fire upon hiscities and it shall devour the palaces thereof rejoice not o israel for joy as other people for thou hastgone a whoring from thy god thou hast loved a reward upon everycornfloor the floor and the winepress shall not feed them and the new wineshall fail in her they shall not dwell in the lords land but ephraim shall returnto egypt and they shall eat unclean things in assyria they shall not offer wine offerings to the lord neither shallthey be pleasing unto him their sacrifices shall be unto them as thebread of mourners all that eat thereof shall be polluted for theirbread for their soul

bury them the pleasant places fortheir silver nettles shall possess them thorns shall be in theirtabernacles the days of visitation are come the days of recompence are comeisrael shall know it the prophet is a fool the spiritual man is madfor the multitude of thine iniquity and the great hatred the watchman of ephraim was with my god but the prophet is asnare of a fowler in all his ways and hatred in the house of his god they have deeply corrupted themselves as in the days of gibeahtherefore he will remember their iniquity he will visit their sins i found israel like grapes in the wilderness i saw your fathersas the firstripe in the fig tree at her first time but they went tobaalpeor and separated themselves unto that shame and theirabominations were according as they loved as for ephraim their glory shall fly away like a bird from thebirth and from the womb and from the conception though they bring up their children yet will i bereave themthat there shall not be a man left yea woe also to them when idepart from them   ephraim as i saw tyrus is planted in apleasant place but ephraim shall bring forth his children to themurderer give them o lord what wilt thou give give them a miscarryingwomb and dry breasts all their wickedness is in gilgal for there i hated them forthe wickedness of their doings i will drive them out of mine house iwill love them no more all their princes are revolters ephraim is smitten their root is dried up they shall bear nofruit yea though they bring forth yet will i slay even the belovedfruit of their womb my god will cast them away because they did not hearken untohim and they shall be wanderers among the nations israel is an empty vine he bringeth forth fruit unto himselfaccording to the multitude of his fruit he hath increased the altarsaccording to the goodness of his land they have made goodly images their heart is divided now shall they be found faulty he shallbreak down their altars he shall spoil their images for now they shall say we have no king because we feared notthe lord what then should a king do to us   they have spokenwords swearing falsely in making a covenant thus judgment springethup as hemlock in the furrows of the field the inhabitants of samaria shall fear because of the calves ofbethaven for the people thereof shall mourn over it and the prieststhereof that rejoiced on it for the glory thereof because it isdeparted from it it shall be also carried unto assyria for a present to kingjareb ephraim shall receive shame and israel shall be ashamed of hisown counsel as for samaria her king is cut off as the foam upon the water the high places also of aven the sin of israel shall bedestroyed the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altarsand they shall say to the mountains cover us and to the hills fallon us o israel thou hast sinned from the days of gibeah there theystood the battle in gibeah against the children of iniquity did notovertake them it is in my desire that i should chastise them and the peopleshall be gathered against them when they shall bind themselves intheir two furrows and ephraim is as an heifer that is taught and loveth to treadout the corn but i passed over upon her fair neck i will makeephraim to ride judah shall plow and jacob shall break his clods sow to yourselves in righteousness reap in mercy break up yourfallow ground for it is time to seek the lord till he come and rainrighteousness upon you ye have plowed wickedness ye have reaped iniquity ye haveeaten the fruit of lies because thou didst trust in thy way in themultitude of thy mighty men therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people and all thyfortresses shall be spoiled as shalman spoiled betharbel in the dayof battle the mother was dashed in pieces upon her children so shall bethel do unto you because of your great wickedness ina morning shall the king of israel utterly be cut off when israel was a child then i loved him and called my son outof egypt as they called them so they went from them they sacrificed untobaalim and burned incense to graven images i taught ephraim also to go taking them by their arms but theyknew not that i healed them i drew them with cords of a man with bands of love and i was tothem as they that take off the yoke on their jaws and i laid meatunto them he shall not return into the land of egypt and the assyrianshall be his king because they refused to return and the sword shall abide on his cities and shall consume hisbranches and devour them because of their own counsels and my people are bent to backsliding from me though they calledthem to the most high none at all would exalt him how shall i give thee up ephraim how shall i deliver theeisrael  how shall i make thee as admah how shall i set thee aszeboim mine heart is turned within me my repentings are kindledtogether i will not execute the fierceness of mine anger i will notreturn to destroy ephraim for i am god and not man the holy one inthe midst of thee and i will not enter into the city they shall walk after the lord he shall roar like a lion whenhe shall roar then the children shall tremble from the west they shall tremble as a bird out of egypt and as a dove out ofthe land of assyria and i will place them in their houses saith thelord ephraim compasseth me about with lies and the house of israelwith deceit but judah yet ruleth with god and is faithful with thesaints ephraim feedeth on wind and followeth after the east wind hedaily increaseth lies and desolation and they do make a covenant withthe assyrians and oil is carried into egypt the lord hath also a controversy with judah and will punishjacob according to his ways according to his doings will herecompense him he took his brother by the heel in the womb and by his strengthhe had power with god  yea he had power over the angel andprevailed he wept and made supplication unto him he found him inbethel and there he spake with us  even the lord god of hoststhe lord is his memorial therefore turn thou to thy god keep mercy and judgment and waiton thy god continually he is a merchant the balances of deceit are in his hand heloveth to oppress and ephraim said yet i am become rich i have found me outsubstance in all my labours they shall find none iniquity in me thatwere sin and i that am the lord thy god from the land of egypt will yetmake thee to dwell in tabernacles as in the days of the solemn feast i have also spoken by the prophets and i have multipliedvisions and used similitudes by the ministry of the prophets is there iniquity in gilead surely they are vanity theysacrifice bullocks in gilgal yea their altars are as heaps in thefurrows of the fields and jacob fled into the country of syria and israel served fora wife and for a wife he kept sheep and by a prophet the lord brought israel out of egypt and by aprophet was he preserved ephraim provoked him to anger most bitterly therefore shall heleave his blood upon him and his reproach shall his lord return untohim when ephraim spake trembling he exalted himself in israel butwhen he offended in baal he died and now they sin more and more and have made them molten imagesof their silver and idols according to their own understanding allof it the work of the craftsmen they say of them let the men thatsacrifice kiss the calves therefore they shall be as the morning cloud and as the early dewthat passeth away as the chaff that is driven with the whirlwind outof the floor and as the smoke out of the chimney yet i am the lord thy god from the land of egypt and thou shaltknow no god but me for there is no saviour beside me i did know thee in the wilderness in the land of great drought according to their pasture so were they filled they werefilled and their heart was exalted therefore have they forgotten me therefore i will be unto them as a lion as a leopard by the waywill i observe them  i will meet them as a bear that is bereavedof her whelps and will rend the caul of their heart and there will idevour them like a lion the wild beast shall tear them o israel thou hast destroyed thyself but in me is thine help i will be thy king where is any other that may save thee in allthy

thereof for they know not to do right saith the lord who store upviolence and robbery in their palaces therefore thus saith the lord god an adversary there shall beeven round about the land and he shall bring down thy strength fromthee and thy palaces shall be spoiled thus saith the lord as the shepherd taketh out of the mouth ofthe lion two legs or a piece of an ear so shall the children ofisrael be taken out that dwell in samaria in the corner of a bed andin damascus in a couch hear ye and testify in the house of jacob saith the lord godthe god of hosts  that in the day that i shall visit thetransgressions of israel upon him i will also visit the altars ofbethel and the horns of the altar shall be cut off and fall to theground and i will smite the winter house with the summer house and thehouses of ivory shall perish and the great houses shall have an endsaith the lord hear this word ye kine of bashan that are in the mountain ofsamaria which oppress the poor which crush the needy which say totheir masters bring and let us drink the lord god hath sworn by his holiness that lo the days shallcome upon you that he will take you away with hooks and yourposterity with fishhooks and ye shall go out at the breaches every cow at that which isbefore her and ye shall cast them into the palace saith the lord come to bethel and transgress at gilgal multiply transgressionand bring your sacrifices every morning and your tithes after threeyears  and offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving with leaven andproclaim and publish the free offerings for this liketh you o yechildren of israel saith the lord god and i also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your citiesand want of bread in all your places yet have ye not returned untome saith the lord and also i have withholden the rain from you when there were yetthree months to the harvest and i caused it to rain upon one cityand caused it not to rain upon another city one piece was rainedupon and the piece whereupon it rained not withered so two or three cities wandered unto one city to drink water butthey were not satisfied yet have ye not returned unto me saith thelord i have smitten you with blasting and mildew when your gardens andyour vineyards and your fig trees and your olive trees increased thepalmerworm devoured them yet have ye not returned unto me saith thelord i have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of egyptyour young men have i slain with the sword and have taken away yourhorses and i have made the stink of your camps to come up unto yournostrils yet have ye not returned unto me saith the lord i have overthrown some of you as god overthrew sodom andgomorrah and ye were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning yethave ye not returned unto me saith the lord therefore thus will i do unto thee o israel and because i willdo this unto thee prepare to meet thy god o israel for lo he that formeth the mountains and createth the windand declareth unto man what is his thought that maketh the morningdarkness and treadeth upon the high places of the earth the lordthe god of hosts is his name hear ye this word which i take up against you even a lamentationo house of israel the virgin of israel is fallen she shall no more rise she isforsaken upon her land there is none to raise her up for thus saith the lord god the city that went out by a thousandshall leave an hundred and that which went forth by an hundred shallleave ten to the house of israel for thus saith the lord unto the house of israel seek ye me andye shall live  but seek not bethel nor enter into gilgal andpass not to beersheba for gilgal shall surely go into captivity andbethel shall come to nought seek the lord and ye shall live lest he break out like fire inthe house of joseph and devour it and there be none to quench it inbethel ye who turn judgment to wormwood and leave off righteousness inthe earth  seek him that maketh the seven stars and orion andturneth the shadow of death into the morning and maketh the day darkwith night that calleth for the waters of the sea and poureth themout upon the face of the earth the lord is his name  thatstrengtheneth the spoiled against the strong so that the spoiledshall come against the fortress they hate him that rebuketh in the gate and they abhor him thatspeaketh uprightly forasmuch therefore as your treading is upon the poor and yetake from him burdens of wheat ye have built houses of hewn stonebut ye shall not dwell in them ye have planted pleasant vineyardsbut ye shall not drink wine of them for i know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sinsthey afflict the just they take a bribe and they turn aside the poorin the gate from their right therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time for it isan evil time seek good and not evil that ye may live and so the lord thegod of hosts shall be with you as ye have spoken hate the evil and love the good and establish judgment in thegate it may be that the lord god of hosts will be gracious unto theremnant of joseph therefore the lord the god of hosts the lord saith thuswailing shall be in all streets and they shall say in all thehighways alas alas  and they shall call the husbandman to mourningand such as are skilful of lamentation to wailing and in all vineyards shall be wailing for i will pass throughthee saith the lord woe unto you that desire the day of the lord to what end is itfor you the day of the lord is darkness and not light as if a man did flee from a lion and a bear met him or wentinto the house and leaned his hand on the wall and a serpent bithim shall not the day of the lord be darkness and not light evenvery dark and no brightness in it   i hate i despise your feastdays and i will not smell in your solemn assemblies though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings iwill not accept them neither will i regard the peace offerings ofyour fat beasts take thou away from me the noise of thy songs for i will nothear the melody of thy viols but let judgment run down as waters and righteousness as amighty stream have ye offered unto me sacrifices and offerings in thewilderness forty years o house of israel   but ye have borne thetabernacle of your moloch and chiun your images the star of your godwhich ye made to yourselves therefore will i cause you to go into captivity beyond damascussaith the lord whose name is the god of hosts woe to them that are at ease in zion and trust in the mountain ofsamaria which are named chief of the nations to whom the house ofisrael came   pass ye unto calneh and see and from thence go yeto hamath the great then go down to gath of the philistines be theybetter than these kingdoms or their border greater than your border ye that put far away the evil day and cause the seat of violenceto come near  that lie upon beds of ivory and stretch themselvesupon their couches and eat the lambs out of the flock and the calvesout of the midst of the stall  that chant to the sound of theviol and invent to themselves instruments of musick like david that drink wine in bowls and anoint themselves with the chiefointments but they are not grieved for the affliction of joseph therefore now shall they go captive with the first that gocaptive and the banquet of them that stretched themselves shall beremoved the lord god hath sworn by himself saith the lord the god ofhosts i abhor the excellency of jacob and hate his palacestherefore will i deliver up the city with all that is therein and it shall come to pass if there remain ten men in one housethat they shall die and a mans uncle shall take him up and he that burneth him tobring out the bones out of the house and shall say unto him that isby the sides of the house is there yet any with thee and he shallsay no then shall he say hold thy tongue for we may not makemention of the name of the lord for behold the lord commandeth and he will smite the greathouse with breaches and the little house with clefts shall horses run upon the rock will one plow there with oxenfor ye have turned judgment into gall and the fruit of righteousnessinto hemlock  ye which rejoice in a thing of nought which sayhave we not taken to us horns by our own strength   but beholdi will raise up against you a nation o house of israel saith thelord the god of hosts and they shall afflict you from the entering inof hemath unto the river of the wilderness thus hath the lord god shewed unto me and behold he formedgrasshoppers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growthand lo it was the latter growth after the kings mowings and it came to pass that when they had made an end of eating thegrass of the land then i said o lord god forgive i beseech theeby whom shall jacob arise for he is small the lord repented for this it shall not be saith the lord thus hath the lord god shewed unto me and behold the lord godcalled to contend by fire and it devoured the great deep and did eatup a part then said i o lord god cease i beseech thee by whom shalljacob arise for he is small the lord repented for this this also shall not be saith the lordgod thus he shewed me and behold the lord stood upon a wall made bya plumbline with a plumbline in his hand and the lord said unto me amos what seest thou and i said aplumbline then said the lord behold i will set a plumbline in themidst of my people israel i will not again pass by them any more and the high places of isaac shall be desolate and the sanctuaries ofisrael shall be laid waste and i will rise against the house ofjeroboam with the sword then amaziah the priest of bethel sent to jeroboam king ofisrael saying amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of thehouse of israel the land is not able to bear all his words for thus amos saith jeroboam shall die by the sword and israelshall surely be led away captive out of their own land also amaziah said unto amos o thou seer go flee thee away intothe land of judah and there eat bread and prophesy there  butprophesy not again any more at bethel for it is the kings chapeland it is the kings court then answered amos and said to amaziah i was no prophetneither was i a prophets son but i was an herdman and a gatherer ofsycomore fruit  and the lord took me as i followed the flock andthe lord said unto me go prophesy unto my people israel now therefore hear thou the word of the lord thou sayestprophesy not against israel and drop not thy word against the houseof isaac therefore thus saith the lord thy wife shall be an harlot in thecity and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword and thyland shall be divided by line and thou shalt die in a polluted landand israel shall surely go into captivity forth of his land thus hath the lord god shewed unto me and behold a basket ofsummer fruit and he said amos what seest thou and i said a basket of summerfruit then said the lord unto me the end is come upon my people ofisrael i will not again pass by them any more and the songs of the temple shall be howlings in that day saiththe lord god there shall be many dead bodies in every place theyshall cast them forth with silence hear this o ye that swallow up the needy even to make the poorof the land to fail  saying when will the new moon be gone thatwe may sell corn and the sabbath that we may set forth wheat makingthe ephah small and the shekel great and falsifying the balances bydeceit   that we may buy the poor for silver and the needy for apair of shoes yea and sell the refuse of the wheat   the lordhath sworn by the excellency of jacob surely i will never forget anyof their works shall not the land tremble for this and every one mourn thatdwelleth therein and it shall rise up wholly as a flood and it shallbe cast out and drowned as by the flood of egypt and it shall come to pass in that day saith the lord god that iwill cause the sun to go down at noon and i will darken the earth inthe clear day  and i will turn your feasts into mourning and allyour songs into lamentation and i will bring up sackcloth upon allloins and baldness upon every head and i will make it as themourning of an only son and the end thereof as a bitter day behold the days come saith the lord god that i will send afamine in the land not a famine of bread nor a thirst for water butof hearing the words of the lord  and they shall wander from seato sea and from the north even to the east they shall run to and froto seek the word of the lord and shall not find it in that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint forthirst they that swear by the sin of samaria and say thy god o danliveth and the manner of beersheba liveth even they shall fall andnever rise up again i saw the lord standing upon the altar and he said smite thelintel of the door that the posts may shake and cut them in thehead all of them and i will slay the last of them with the sword hethat fleeth of them shall not flee away and he that escapeth of themshall not be delivered though they dig into hell thence shall mine hand take themthough they climb up to heaven thence will i bring them down  andthough they hide themselves in the top of carmel i will search andtake them out thence and though they be hid from my sight in thebottom of the sea thence will i command the serpent and he shallbite them  and though they go into captivity before their enemiesthence will i command the sword and it shall slay them and i willset mine eyes upon them for evil and not for good and the lord god of hosts is he that toucheth the land and itshall melt and all that dwell therein shall mourn and it shall riseup wholly like a flood and shall be drowned as by the flood ofegypt it is he that buildeth his stories in the heaven and hath foundedhis troop in the earth he that calleth for the waters of the sea andpoureth them out upon the face of the earth the lord is his name are ye not as children of the ethiopians unto me o children ofisrael saith the lord have not i brought up israel out of the landof egypt and the philistines from caphtor and the syrians from kir behold the eyes of the lord god are upon the sinful kingdom andi will destroy it from off the face of the earth saving that i willnot utterly destroy the house of jacob saith the lord for lo i will command and i will sift the house of israel amongall nations like as corn is sifted in a sieve yet shall not theleast grain fall upon the earth all the sinners of my people shall die by the sword which saythe evil shall not overtake nor prevent us in that day will i raise up the tabernacle of david that isfallen and close up the breaches thereof and i will raise up hisruins and i will build it as in the days of old  that they maypossess the remnant of edom and of all the heathen which are calledby my name saith the lord that doeth this behold the days come saith the lord that the plowman shallovertake the reaper and the treader of grapes him that soweth seedand the

jacob shame shall coverthee and thou shalt be cut off for ever in the day that thou stoodest on the other side in the day thatthe strangers carried away captive his forces and foreigners enteredinto his gates and cast lots upon jerusalem even thou wast as one ofthem but thou shouldest not have looked on the day of thy brother inthe day that he became a stranger neither shouldest thou haverejoiced over the children of judah in the day of their destructionneither shouldest thou have spoken proudly in the day of distress thou shouldest not have entered into the gate of my people in theday of

amittaisaying  arise go to nineveh that great city and cry against itfor their wickedness is come up before me but jonah rose up to flee unto tarshish from the presence of thelord and went down to joppa and he found a ship going to tarshishso he paid the fare thereof and went down into it to go with themunto tarshish from the presence of the lord but the lord sent out a great wind into the sea and there was amighty tempest in the sea so that the ship was like to be broken then the mariners were afraid and cried every man unto his godand cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea tolighten it of them but jonah was gone down into the sides of theship and he lay and was fast asleep so the shipmaster came to him and said unto him what meanestthou o sleeper arise call upon thy god if so be that god willthink upon us that we perish not and they said every one to his fellow come and let us cast lotsthat we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us so they castlots and the lot fell upon jonah then said they unto him tell us we pray thee for whose causethis evil is upon us what is thine occupation and whence comestthou what is thy country and of what people art thou   and hesaid unto them i am an hebrew and i fear the lord the god ofheaven which hath made the sea and the dry land then were the men exceedingly afraid and said unto him why hastthou done this for the men knew that he fled from the presence of thelord because he had told them then said they unto him what shall we do unto thee that the seamay be calm unto us for the sea wrought and was tempestuous and he said unto them take me up and cast me forth into thesea so shall the sea be calm unto you for i know that for my sakethis great tempest is upon you nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring it to the land but theycould not for the sea wrought and was tempestuous against them wherefore they cried unto the lord and said we beseech thee olord we beseech thee let us not perish for this mans life and laynot upon us innocent blood for thou o lord hast done as it pleasedthee so they look up jonah and cast him forth into the sea and thesea ceased from her raging then the men feared the lord exceedingly and offered a sacrificeunto the lord and made vows now the lord had prepared a great fish to swallow up jonah andjonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights then jonah prayed unto the lord his god out of the fishs belly and said i cried by reason of mine affliction unto the lord andhe heard me out of the belly of hell cried i and thou heardest myvoice for thou hadst cast me into the deep in the midst of the seasand the floods compassed me about all thy billows and thy wavespassed over me then i said i am cast out of thy sight yet i will look againtoward thy holy temple the waters compassed me about even to the soul the depth closedme round about the weeds were wrapped about my head i went down to the bottoms of the mountains the earth with herbars was about me for ever yet hast thou brought up my life fromcorruption o lord my god when my soul fainted within me i remembered the lord and myprayer came in unto thee into thine holy temple they that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy but i will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving iwill pay that that i have vowed salvation is of the lord and the lord spake unto the fish and it vomited out jonah uponthe dry land and the word of the lord came unto jonah the second time saying arise go unto nineveh that great city and preach unto it thepreaching that i bid thee so jonah arose and went unto nineveh according to the word ofthe lord now nineveh was an exceeding great city of three daysjourney and jonah began to enter into the city a days journey and hecried and said yet forty days and nineveh shall be overthrown so the people of nineveh believed god and proclaimed a fast andput on sackcloth from the greatest of them even to the least of them for word came unto the king of nineveh and he arose from histhrone and he laid his robe from him and covered him with sackclothand sat in ashes and he caused it to be proclaimed and published through nineveh bythe decree of the king and his nobles saying let neither man norbeast herd nor flock taste any thing let them not feed nor drinkwater  but let man and beast be covered with sackcloth and crymightily unto god yea let them turn every one from his evil way andfrom the violence that is in their hands who can tell if god will turn and repent and turn away from hisfierce anger that we perish not   and god saw their works thatthey turned from their evil way and god repented of the evil that hehad said that he would do unto them and he did it not but it displeased jonah exceedingly and he was very angry and he prayed unto the lord and said i pray thee o lord wasnot this my saying when i was yet in my country therefore i fledbefore unto tarshish for i knew that thou art a gracious god andmerciful slow to anger and of great kindness and repentest thee ofthe evil therefore now o lord take i beseech thee my life from me forit is better for me to die than to live then said the lord doest thou well to be angry   so jonahwent out of the city and sat on the east side of the city and theremade him a booth and sat under it in the shadow till he might seewhat would become of the city and the lord god prepared a gourd and made it to come up overjonah that it might be a shadow over his head to deliver him fromhis grief so jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd but god prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day and itsmote the gourd that it withered and it came to pass when the sun did arise that god prepared avehement east wind and the sun beat upon the head of jonah that hefainted and wished in himself to die and said it is better for meto die than to live and god said to jonah doest thou well to be angry for the gourdand he said i do well to be angry even unto death then said the lord thou hast had pity on the gourd for thewhich thou hast not laboured neither madest it grow which came up ina night and perished in a night  and should not i spare ninevehthat great city wherein are more then sixscore thousand persons thatcannot discern between their right hand and their left hand and alsomuch cattlemicah the word of the lord that came to micah the morasthite in thedays of jotham ahaz and hezekiah kings of judah which he sawconcerning samaria and jerusalem hear all ye people hearken o earth and all that therein isand let the lord god be witness against you the lord from

as wax before the fire and as the waters that are poureddown a steep place for the transgression of jacob is all this and for the sins ofthe house of israel what is the transgression of jacob is it notsamaria and what are the high places of judah are they notjerusalem   therefore i will make samaria as an heap of the fieldand as plantings of a vineyard and i will pour down the stonesthereof into the valley and i will discover the foundations thereof and all the graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces andall the hires thereof shall be burned with the fire and all the idolsthereof will i lay desolate for she gathered it of the hire of anharlot and they shall return to the hire of an harlot therefore i will wail and howl i will go stripped and naked iwill make a wailing like the

house of godsherezer and regemmelech and their men to pray before the lord and to speak unto the priests which were in the house of the lord ofhosts and to the prophets saying should i weep in the fifth monthseparating myself as i have done these so many years   then camethe word of the lord of hosts unto me saying  speak unto all thepeople of the land and to the priests saying when ye fasted andmourned in the fifth and seventh month even those seventy years didye at all fast unto me even to me   and when ye did eat and whenye did drink did not ye eat for yourselves and drink for

lord is contemptible and if ye offer the blind for sacrifice is it not evil and if yeoffer the lame and sick is it not evil offer it now unto thygovernor will he be pleased with thee or accept thy person saiththe lord of hosts and now i pray you beseech god that he will be gracious unto usthis hath been by your means will he regard your persons saith thelord of hosts who is there even among you that would shut the doors for noughtneither do ye kindle fire on mine altar for nought i have no pleasurein you saith the lord of hosts neither will i accept an offering atyour hand for from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of thesame my name shall be great among the gentiles and in every placeincense shall be offered unto my name and a pure offering for myname shall be great among the heathen saith the lord of hosts but ye have profaned it in that ye say the table of the lord ispolluted and the fruit thereof even his meat is contemptible ye said also behold what a weariness is it and ye have snuffedat it saith the lord of hosts and ye brought that which was tornand the lame and the sick thus ye brought an offering should iaccept this of your hand saith the lord but cursed be the deceiver which hath in his flock a male andvoweth and sacrificeth unto the lord a corrupt thing for i am agreat king saith the lord of hosts and my name is dreadful among theheathen and now o ye priests this commandment is for you if ye will not hear and if ye will not lay it to heart to giveglory unto my name saith the lord of hosts i will even send a curseupon you and i will curse your blessings yea i have cursed themalready because ye do not lay it to heart behold i will corrupt your seed and spread dung upon your faceseven the dung of your solemn feasts and one shall take you away withit and ye shall know that i have sent this commandment unto you thatmy covenant might be with levi saith the lord of hosts my covenant was with him of life and peace and i gave them to himfor the fear wherewith he feared me and was afraid before my name the law of truth was in his mouth and iniquity was not found inhis lips he walked with me in peace and equity and did turn manyaway from iniquity for the priests lips should keep knowledge and they should seekthe law at his mouth for he is the messenger of the lord of hosts but ye are departed out of the way ye have caused many to stumbleat the law ye have corrupted the covenant of levi saith the lord ofhosts therefore have i also made you contemptible and base before allthe people according as ye have not kept my ways but have beenpartial in the law have we not all one father hath not one god created us why dowe deal treacherously every man against his brother by profaning thecovenant of our fathers   judah hath dealt treacherously and anabomination is committed in israel and in jerusalem for judah hathprofaned the holiness of the lord which he loved and hath married thedaughter of a strange god the lord will cut off the man that doeth this the master and thescholar out of the tabernacles of jacob and him that offereth anoffering unto the lord of hosts and this have ye done again covering the altar of the lord withtears with weeping and with crying out insomuch that he regardethnot the offering any more or receiveth it with good will at yourhand yet ye say wherefore because the lord hath been witness betweenthee and the wife of thy youth against whom thou hast dealttreacherously yet is she thy companion and the wife of thy covenant and did not he make one yet had he the residue of the spiritand wherefore one that he might seek a godly seed therefore takeheed to your spirit and let none deal treacherously against the wifeof his youth for the lord the god of israel saith that he hateth puttingaway for one covereth violence with his garment saith the lord ofhosts therefore take heed to your spirit that ye deal nottreacherously ye have wearied the lord with your words yet ye say whereinhave we wearied him when ye say every one that doeth evil is good inthe sight of the lord and he delighteth in them or where is the godof judgment   behold i will send my messenger and he shallprepare the way before me and the lord whom ye seek shall suddenlycome to his temple even the messenger of the covenant whom yedelight in behold he shall come saith the lord of hosts but who may abide the day of his coming and who shall stand whenhe appeareth for he is like a refiners fire and like fullers soap and he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver and he shallpurify the sons of levi and purge them as gold and silver that theymay offer unto the lord an offering in righteousness then shall the offering of judah and jerusalem be pleasant untothe lord as in the days of old and as in former years and i will come near to you to judgment and i will be a swiftwitness against the sorcerers and against the adulterers and againstfalse swearers and against those that oppress the hireling in hiswages the widow and the fatherless and that turn aside the strangerfrom his right and fear not me saith the lord of hosts for i am the lord i change not therefore ye sons of jacob arenot consumed even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mineordinances and have not kept them return unto me and i will returnunto you saith the lord of hosts but ye said wherein shall wereturn   will a man rob god yet ye have robbed me but ye saywherein have we robbed thee in tithes and offerings ye are cursed with a curse for ye have robbed me even this wholenation bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse that there may bemeat in mine house and prove me now herewith saith the lord ofhosts if i will not open you the windows of heaven and pour you outa blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it and i will rebuke the devourer for your sakes and he shall notdestroy the fruits of your ground neither shall your vine cast herfruit before the time in the field saith the lord of hosts and all nations shall call you blessed for ye shall be adelightsome land saith the lord of hosts your words have been stout against me saith the lord yet yesay what have we spoken so much against thee   ye have said itis vain to serve god and what profit is it that we have kept hisordinance and that we have walked mournfully before the lord ofhosts   and now we call the proud happy yea they that workwickedness are set up yea they that tempt god are even delivered then they that feared the lord spake often one to another andthe lord hearkened and heard it and a book of remembrance waswritten before him for them that feared the lord and that thoughtupon his name and they shall be mine saith the lord of hosts in that day wheni make up my jewels and i will spare them as a man spareth his ownson that serveth him then shall ye return and discern between the righteous and thewicked between him that serveth god and him that serveth him not for behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and allthe proud yea and all that do wickedly shall be stubble and theday that cometh shall burn them up saith the lord of hosts that itshall leave them neither root nor branch but unto you that fear my name shall the sun of righteousnessarise with healing in his wings and ye shall go forth and grow up ascalves of the stall and ye shall tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes underthe soles of your feet in the day that i shall do this saith the lordof hosts remember ye the law of moses my servant which i commanded untohim in horeb for all israel with the statutes and judgments behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming ofthe great and dreadful day of the lord  and he shall turn theheart of the fathers to the children and the

of whom was born jesus who is calledchrist so all the generations from abraham to david are fourteengenerations and from david until the carrying away into babylon arefourteen generations and from the carrying away into babylon untochrist are fourteen generations now the birth of jesus christ was on this wise when as hismother mary was espoused to joseph before they came together she wasfound with child of the holy ghost then joseph her husband being a just man and not willing tomake her a publick example was minded to put her away privily but while he thought on these things behold the angel of thelord appeared unto him in a dream saying joseph thou son of davidfear not to take unto thee mary thy wife for that which is conceivedin her is of the holy ghost and she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his namejesus for he shall save his people from their sins now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which wasspoken of the lord by the prophet saying  behold a virgin shallbe with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call hisname emmanuel which being interpreted is god with us then joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the lordhad bidden him and took unto him his wife  and knew her not tillshe had brought forth her firstborn son and he called his name jesus now when jesus was born in bethlehem of judaea in the days ofherod the king behold there came wise men from the east tojerusalem  saying where is he that is born king of the jews forwe have seen his star in the east and are come to worship him when herod the king had heard these things he was troubled andall jerusalem with him and when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of thepeople together he demanded of them where christ should be born and they said unto him in bethlehem of judaea for thus it iswritten by the prophet  and thou bethlehem in the land of judaart not the least among the princes of juda for out of thee shallcome a governor that shall rule my people israel then herod when he had privily called the wise men enquired ofthem diligently what time the star appeared and he sent them to bethlehem and said go and search diligentlyfor the young child and when ye have found him bring me word againthat i may come and worship him also when they had heard the king they departed and lo the starwhich they saw in the east went before them till it came and stoodover where the young child was when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy and when they were come into the house they saw the young childwith mary his mother and fell down and worshipped him and when theyhad opened their treasures they presented unto him gifts gold andfrankincense and myrrh and being warned of god in a dream that they should not return toherod they departed into their own country another way and when they were departed behold the angel of the lordappeareth to joseph in a dream saying arise and take the youngchild and his mother and flee into egypt and be thou there until ibring thee word for herod will seek the young child to destroy him when he arose he took the young child and his mother by nightand departed into egypt  and was there until the death of herodthat it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the lord by theprophet saying out of egypt have i called my son then herod when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men wasexceeding wroth and sent forth and slew all the children that werein bethlehem and in all the coasts thereof from two years old andunder according to the time which he had diligently enquired of thewise men then was fulfilled that which was spoken by jeremy the prophetsaying  in rama was there a voice heard lamentation andweeping and great mourning rachel weeping for her children andwould not be comforted because they are not but when herod was dead behold an angel of the lord appearethin a dream to joseph in egypt  saying arise and take the youngchild and his mother and go into the land of israel for they aredead which sought the young childs life and he arose and took the young child and his mother and cameinto the land of israel but when he heard that archelaus did reign in judaea in the roomof his father herod he was afraid to go thither notwithstandingbeing warned of god in a dream he turned aside into the parts ofgalilee  and he came and dwelt in a city called nazareth that itmight be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets he shall becalled a nazarene in those days came john the baptist preaching in the wildernessof judaea  and saying repent ye for the kingdom of heaven is athand for this is he that was spoken of by the prophet esaias sayingthe voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of thelord make his paths straight and the same john had his raiment of camels hair and a leatherngirdle about his loins and his meat was locusts and wild honey then went out to him jerusalem and all judaea and all the regionround about jordan  and were baptized of him in jordan confessingtheir sins but when he saw many of the pharisees and sadducees come to hisbaptism he said unto them o generation of vipers who hath warnedyou to flee from the wrath to come   bring forth therefore fruitsmeet for repentance  and think not to say within yourselves wehave abraham to our father for i say unto you that god is able ofthese stones to raise up children unto abraham and now also the axe is laid unto the root of the treestherefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn downand cast into the fire i indeed baptize you with water unto repentance but he thatcometh after me is mightier than i whose shoes i am not worthy tobear he shall baptize you with the holy ghost and with fire whose fan is in his hand and he will throughly purge his floor andgather his wheat into the garner but he will burn up the chaff withunquenchable fire then cometh jesus from galilee to jordan unto john to bebaptized of him but john forbad him saying i have need to be baptized of theeand comest thou to me   and jesus answering said unto him sufferit to be so now for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousnessthen he suffered him and jesus when he was baptized went up straightway out of thewater and lo the heavens were opened unto him and he saw thespirit of god descending like a dove and lighting upon him  andlo a voice from heaven saying this is my beloved son in whom i amwell pleased then was jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to betempted of the devil and when he had fasted forty days and forty nights he wasafterward an hungred and when the tempter came to him he said if thou be the son ofgod command that these stones be made bread but he answered and said it is written man shall not live bybread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth ofgod then the devil taketh him up into the holy city and setteth himon a pinnacle of the temple  and saith unto him if thou be theson of god cast thyself down for it is written he shall give hisangels charge concerning thee and in their hands they shall bear theeup lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone jesus said unto him it is written again thou shalt not tempt thelord thy god again the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountainand sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them and saith unto him all these things will i give thee if thouwilt fall down and worship me then saith jesus unto him get thee hence satan for it iswritten thou shalt worship the lord thy god and him only shalt thouserve then the devil leaveth him and behold angels came andministered unto him now when jesus had heard that john was cast into prison hedeparted into galilee  and leaving nazareth he came and dwelt incapernaum which is upon the sea coast in the borders of zabulon andnephthalim  that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by esaiasthe prophet saying  the land of zabulon and the land ofnephthalim by the way of the sea beyond jordan galilee of thegentiles  the people which sat in darkness saw great light andto them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprungup from that time jesus began to preach and to say repent for thekingdom of heaven is at hand and jesus walking by the sea of galilee saw two brethren simoncalled peter and andrew his brother casting a net into the sea forthey were fishers and he saith unto them follow me and i will make you fishers ofmen and they straightway left their nets and followed him and going on from thence he saw other two brethren james theson of zebedee and john his brother in a ship with zebedee theirfather mending their nets and he called them and they immediately left the ship and their father and followedhim and jesus went about all galilee teaching in their synagoguesand preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing all manner ofsickness and all manner of disease among the people and his fame went throughout all syria and they brought unto himall sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments andthose which were possessed with devils and those which were lunatickand those that had the palsy and he healed them and there followed him great multitudes of people from galileeand from decapolis and from jerusalem and from judaea and frombeyond jordan and seeing the multitudes he went up into a mountain and when hewas set his disciples came unto him  and he opened his mouth andtaught them saying  blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs isthe kingdom of heaven blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousnessfor they shall be filled blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see god blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the childrenof god blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sakefor theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you andshall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your reward inheaven for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you ye are the salt of the earth but if the salt have lost hissavour wherewith shall it be salted it is thenceforth good fornothing but to be cast out and to be trodden under foot of men ye are the light of the world a city that is set on an hillcannot be hid neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but ona candlestick and it giveth light unto all that are in the house let your light so shine before men that they may see your goodworks and glorify your father which is in heaven think not that i am come to destroy the law or the prophets iam not come to destroy but to fulfil for verily i say unto you till heaven and earth pass one jot orone tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandmentsand shall teach men so he shall be called the least in the kingdom ofheaven but whosoever shall do and teach them the same shall becalled great in the kingdom of heaven for i say unto you that except your righteousness shall exceedthe righteousness of the scribes and pharisees ye shall in no caseenter into the kingdom of heaven ye have heard that it was said by them of old time thou shaltnot kill and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment but i say unto you that whosoever is angry with his brotherwithout a cause shall be in danger of the judgment and whosoevershall say to his brother raca shall be in danger of the council butwhosoever shall say thou fool shall be in danger of hell fire therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar and thererememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee  leave therethy gift before the altar and go thy way first be reconciled to thybrother and then come and offer thy gift agree with thine adversary quickly whiles thou art in the waywith him lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judgeand the judge deliver thee to the officer and thou be cast intoprison verily i say unto thee thou shalt by no means come out thencetill thou hast paid the uttermost farthing ye have heard that it was said by them of old time thou shaltnot commit adultery  but i say unto you that whosoever lookethon a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her alreadyin his heart and if thy right eye offend thee pluck it out and cast it fromthee for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members shouldperish and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell and if thy right hand offend thee cut it off and cast it fromthee for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members shouldperish and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell it hath been said whosoever shall put away his wife let himgive her a writing of divorcement  but i say unto you thatwhosoever shall put away his wife saving for the cause offornication causeth her to commit adultery and whosoever shall marryher that is divorced committeth adultery again ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old timethou shalt not forswear thyself but shalt perform unto the lord thineoaths  but i say unto you swear not at all neither by heavenfor it is gods throne  nor by the earth for it is hisfootstool neither by jerusalem for it is the city of the great king neither shalt thou swear by thy head because thou canst not makeone hair white or black but let your communication be yea yea nay nay for whatsoeveris more than these cometh of evil ye have heard that it hath been said an eye for an eye and atooth for a tooth  but i say unto you that ye resist not evilbut whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn to him theother also and if any man will sue thee at the law and take away thy coatlet him have thy cloak also and whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile go with him twain give to him that asketh thee and from him that would borrow ofthee turn not thou away ye have heard that it hath been said thou shalt love thyneighbour and hate thine enemy but i say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse youdo good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefullyuse you and persecute you  that ye may be the children of yourfather which is in heaven for he maketh his sun to rise on the eviland on the good and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust for if ye love them which love you what reward have ye do noteven the publicans the same   and if ye salute your brethrenonly what do ye more than others do not even the publicans so  be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven isperfect take heed that ye do not your alms before men to be seen of themotherwise ye have no reward of your father which is in heaven therefore when thou doest thine alms do not sound a trumpetbefore thee as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in thestreets that they may have glory of men verily i say unto you theyhave their reward but when thou doest alms let not thy left hand know what thyright hand doeth  that thine alms may be in secret and thy fatherwhich seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly and when thou prayest thou shalt not be as the hypocrites arefor they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners ofthe streets that they may be seen of men verily i say unto you theyhave their reward but thou when thou prayest enter into thy closet and when thouhast shut thy door pray to thy father which is in secret and thyfather which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly but when ye pray use not vain repetitions as the heathen do forthey think that they shall be heard for their much speaking be not ye therefore like unto them for your father knoweth whatthings ye have need of before ye ask him after this manner therefore pray ye our father which art inheaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil forthine is the kingdom and the power and the glory for ever amen for if ye forgive men their trespasses your heavenly father willalso forgive you  but if ye forgive not men their trespassesneither will your father forgive your trespasses moreover when ye fast be not as the hypocrites of a sadcountenance for they disfigure their faces that they may appear untomen to fast verily i say unto you they have their reward but thou when thou fastest anoint thine head and wash thyface  that thou appear not unto men to fast but unto thy fatherwhich is in secret and thy father which seeth in secret shallreward thee openly lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth where moth andrust doth corrupt and where thieves break through and steal  butlay up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rustdoth corrupt and where thieves do not break through nor steal for where your treasure is there will your heart be also the light of the body is the eye if therefore thine eye besingle thy whole body shall be full of light but if thine eye be evil thy whole body shall be full ofdarknessif therefore the light that is in thee be darkness how great is thatdarkness   no man can serve two masters for either he will hatethe one and love the other or else he will hold to the one anddespise the other ye cannot serve god and mammon therefore i say unto you take no thought for your life what yeshall eat or what ye shall drink nor yet for your body what yeshall put on is not the life more than meat and the body thanraiment   behold the fowls of the air for they sow not neitherdo they reap nor gather into barns yet your heavenly father feedeththem are ye not much better than they   which of you by takingthought can add one cubit unto his stature   and why take yethought for raiment consider the lilies of the field how they growthey toil not neither do they spin  and yet i say unto you thateven solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these wherefore if god so clothe the grass of the field which to dayis and to morrow is cast into the oven shall he not much more clotheyou o ye of little faith   therefore take no thought sayingwhat shall we eat or what shall we drink or wherewithal shall webe clothed   for after all these things do the gentiles seekfor your heavenly father knoweth that ye have need of all thesethings but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness andall these things shall be added unto you take therefore no thought for the morrow for the morrow shalltake thought for the things of itself sufficient unto the day is theevil thereof judge not that ye be not judged for with what judgment ye judge ye shall be judged and with whatmeasure ye mete it shall be measured to you again and why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brothers eye butconsiderest not the beam that is in thine own eye   or how wiltthou say to thy brother let me pull out the mote out of thine eyeand behold a beam is in thine own eye   thou hypocrite firstcast out the beam out of thine own eye and then shalt thou seeclearly to cast out the mote out of thy brothers eye give not that which is holy unto the dogs neither cast ye yourpearls before swine lest they trample them under their feet and turnagain and rend you ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knockand it shall be opened unto you  for every one that askethreceiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh itshall be opened or what man is there of you whom if his son ask bread will hegive him a stone   or if he ask a fish will he give him aserpent   if ye then being evil know how to give good giftsunto your children how much more shall your father which is in heavengive good things to them that ask him   therefore all thingswhatsoever ye would that men should do to you do ye even so to themfor this is the law and the prophets enter ye in at the strait gate for wide is the gate and broadis the way that leadeth to destruction and many there be which go inthereat  because strait is the gate and narrow is the way whichleadeth unto life and few there be that find it beware of false prophets which come to you in sheeps clothingbut inwardly they are ravening wolves ye shall know them by their fruits do men gather grapes ofthorns or figs of thistles   even so every good tree bringethforth good fruit but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupttree bring forth good fruit every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down andcast into the fire wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them not every one that saith unto me lord lord shall enter intothe kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father whichis in heaven many will say to me in that day lord lord have we notprophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and inthy name done many wonderful works   and then will i profess untothem i never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and doeththem i will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon arock  and the rain descended and the floods came and the windsblew and beat upon that house and it fell not for it was foundedupon a rock and every one that heareth these sayings of mine and doeth themnot shall be likened unto a foolish man which built his house uponthe sand  and the rain descended and the floods came and thewinds blew and beat upon that house and it fell and great was thefall of it and it came to pass when jesus had ended these sayings thepeople were astonished at his doctrine  for he taught them as onehaving authority and not as the scribes when he was come down from the mountain great multitudes followedhim and behold there came a leper and worshipped him saying lordif thou wilt thou canst make me clean and jesus put forth his hand and touched him saying i will bethou clean and immediately his leprosy was cleansed and jesus saith unto him see thou tell no man but go thy wayshew thyself to the priest and offer the gift that moses commandedfor a testimony unto them and when jesus was entered into capernaum there came unto him acenturion beseeching him  and saying lord my servant lieth athome sick of the palsy grievously tormented and jesus saith unto him i will come and heal him the centurion answered and said lord i am not worthy that thoushouldest come under my roof but speak the word only and my servantshall be healed for i am a man under authority having soldiers under me and isay to this man go and he goeth and to another come and hecometh and to my servant do this and he doeth it when jesus heard it he marvelled and said to them thatfollowed verily i say unto you i have not found so great faith nonot in israel and i say unto you that many shall come from the east and westand shall sit down with abraham and isaac and jacob in the kingdomof heaven but the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outerdarkness there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth and jesus said unto the centurion go thy way and as thou hastbelieved so be it done unto thee and his servant was healed in theselfsame hour and when jesus was come into peters house he saw his wifesmother laid and sick of a fever and he touched her hand and the fever left her and she aroseand ministered unto them when the even was come they brought unto him many that werepossessed with devils and he cast out the spirits with his word andhealed all that were sick  that it might be fulfilled which wasspoken by esaias the prophet saying himself took our infirmitiesand bare our sicknesses now when jesus saw great multitudes about him he gavecommandment to depart unto the other side and a certain scribe came and said unto him master i willfollow thee whithersoever thou goest and jesus saith unto him the foxes have holes and the birds ofthe air have nests but the son of man hath not where to lay his head and another of his disciples said unto him lord suffer me firstto go and bury my father but jesus said unto him follow me and let the dead bury theirdead and when he was entered into a ship his disciples followed him and behold there arose a great tempest in the sea insomuchthat the ship was covered with the waves but he was asleep and his disciples came to him and awoke him saying lord saveus we perish and he saith unto them why are ye fearful o ye of little faiththen he arose and rebuked the winds and the sea and there was agreat calm but the men marvelled saying what manner of man is this thateven the winds and the sea obey him   and when he was come to theother side into the country of the gergesenes there met him twopossessed with devils coming out of the tombs exceeding fierce sothat no man might pass by that way and behold they cried out saying what have we to do withthee jesus thou son of god art thou come hither to torment usbefore the time   and there was a good way off from them an herdof many swine feeding so the devils besought him saying if thou cast us out sufferus to go away into the herd of swine and he said unto them go and when they were come out they wentinto the herd of swine and behold the whole herd of swine ranviolently down a steep place into the sea and perished in the waters and they that kept them fled and went their ways into the cityand told every thing and what was befallen to the possessed of thedevils and behold the whole city came out to meet jesus and when theysaw him they besought him that he would depart out of their coasts and he entered into a ship and passed over and came into his owncity and behold they brought to him a man sick of the palsy lying ona bed and jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsyson be of good cheer thy sins be forgiven thee and behold certain of the scribes said within themselves thisman blasphemeth and jesus knowing their thoughts said wherefore think ye evil inyour hearts   for whether is easier to say thy sins be forgiventhee or to say arise and walk   but that ye may know that theson of man hath power on earth to forgive sins then saith he to thesick of the palsy arise take up thy bed and go unto thine house and he arose and departed to his house but when the multitudes saw it they marvelled and glorified godwhich had given such power unto men and as jesus passed forth from thence he saw a man namedmatthew sitting at the receipt of custom and he saith unto himfollow me and he arose and followed him and it came to pass as jesus sat at meat in the house beholdmany publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and hisdisciples and when the pharisees saw it they said unto his disciples whyeateth your master with publicans and sinners   but when jesusheard that he said unto them they that be whole need not aphysician but they that are sick but go ye and learn what that meaneth i will have mercy and notsacrifice for i am not come to call the righteous but sinners torepentance then came to him the disciples of john saying why do we and thepharisees fast oft but thy disciples fast not   and jesus saidunto them can the children of the bridechamber mourn as long as thebridegroom is with them but the days will come when the bridegroomshall be taken from them and then shall they fast no man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment for thatwhich is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment and the rent ismade worse neither do men put new wine into old bottles else the bottlesbreak and the wine runneth out and the bottles perish but they putnew wine into new bottles and both are preserved while he spake these things unto them behold there came acertain ruler and worshipped him saying my daughter is even nowdead but come and lay thy hand upon her and she shall live and jesus arose and followed him and so did his disciples and behold a woman which was diseased with an issue of bloodtwelve years came behind him and touched the hem of his garment for she said within herself if i may but touch his garment ishall be whole but jesus turned him about and when he saw her he saiddaughter be of good comfort thy faith hath made thee whole and thewoman was made whole from that hour and when jesus came into the rulers house and saw the minstrelsand the people making a noise  he said unto them give place forthe maid is not dead but sleepeth and they laughed him to scorn but when the people were put forth he went in and took her bythe hand and the maid arose and the fame hereof went abroad into all that land and when jesus departed thence two blind men followed himcrying and saying thou son of david have mercy on us and when he was come into the house the blind men came to himand jesus saith unto them believe ye that i am able to do this theysaid unto him yea lord then touched he their eyes saying according to your faith be itunto you and their eyes were opened and jesus straitly charged themsaying see that no man know it but they when they were departed spread abroad his fame in allthat country as they went out behold they brought to him a dumb manpossessed with a devil and when the devil was cast out the dumb spake and themultitudes marvelled saying it was never so seen in israel but the pharisees said he casteth out devils through the princeof the devils and jesus went about all the cities and villages teaching intheir synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healingevery sickness and every disease among the people but when he saw the multitudes he was moved with compassion onthem because they fainted and were scattered abroad as sheep havingno shepherd then saith he unto his disciples the harvest truly is plenteousbut the labourers are few  pray ye therefore the lord of theharvest that he will send forth labourers into his harvest and when he had called unto him his twelve disciples he gavethem power against unclean spirits to cast them out and to heal allmanner of sickness and all manner of disease now the names of the twelve apostles are these the first simonwho is called peter and andrew his brother james the son of zebedeeand john his brother  philip and bartholomew thomas andmatthew the publican james the son of alphaeus and lebbaeus whosesurname was thaddaeus  simon the canaanite and judas iscariotwho also betrayed him these twelve jesus sent forth and commanded them saying go notinto the way of the gentiles and into any city of the samaritansenter ye not  but go rather to the lost sheep of the house ofisrael and as ye go preach saying the kingdom of heaven is at hand heal the sick cleanse the lepers raise the dead cast outdevils freely ye have received freely give provide neither gold nor silver nor brass in your purses nor scrip for your journey neither two coats neither shoes nor yetstaves for the workman is worthy of his meat and into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter enquire who init is worthy and there abide till ye go thence and when ye come into an house salute it and if the house be worthy let your peace come upon it but ifit be not worthy let your peace return to you and whosoever shall not receive you nor hear your words whenye depart out of that house or city shake off the dust of your feet verily i say unto you it shall be more tolerable for the landof sodom and gomorrha in the day of judgment than for that city behold i send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves be yetherefore wise as serpents and harmless as doves but beware of men for they will deliver you up to the councilsand they will scourge you in their synagogues  and ye shall bebrought before governors and kings for my sake for a testimonyagainst them and the gentiles but when they deliver you up take no thought how or what yeshall speak for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shallspeak for it is not ye that speak but the spirit of your father whichspeaketh in you and the brother shall deliver up the brother to death and thefather the child and the children shall rise up against theirparents and cause them to be put to death and ye shall be hated of all men for my names sake but he thatendureth to the end shall be saved but when they persecute you in this city flee ye into anotherfor verily i say unto you ye shall not have gone over the cities ofisrael till the son of man be come the disciple is not above his master nor the servant above hislord it is enough for the disciple that he be as his master and theservant as his lord if they have called the master of the housebeelzebub how much more shall they call them of his household  fear them not therefore for there is nothing covered that shall notbe revealed and hid that shall not be known what i tell you in darkness that speak ye in light and what yehear in the ear that preach ye upon the housetops and fear not them which kill the body but are not able to killthe soul but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul andbody in hell are not two sparrows sold for a farthing and one of them shallnot fall on the ground without your father but the very hairs of your head are all numbered fear ye not therefore ye are of more value than many sparrows whosoever therefore shall confess me before men him will iconfess also before my father which is in heaven but whosoever shall deny me before men him will i also denybefore my father which is in heaven think not that i am come to send peace on earth i came not tosend peace but a sword for i am come to set a man at variance against his father andthe daughter against her mother and the daughter in law against hermother in law and a mans foes shall be they of his own household he that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy ofme and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy ofme and he that taketh not his cross and followeth after me is notworthy of me he that findeth his life shall lose it and he that loseth hislife for my sake shall find it he that receiveth you receiveth me and he that receiveth mereceiveth him that sent me he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shallreceive a prophets reward and he that receiveth a righteous man inthe name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous mans reward and whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little onesa cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple verily i say untoyou he shall in no wise lose his reward and it came to pass when jesus had made an end of commanding histwelve disciples he departed thence to teach and to preach in theircities now when john had heard in the prison the works of christ hesent two of his disciples  and said unto him art thou he thatshould come or do we look for another   jesus answered and saidunto them go and shew john again those things which ye do hear andsee  the blind receive their sight and the lame walk the lepersare cleansed and the deaf hear the dead are raised up and the poorhave the gospel preached to them and blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me and as they departed jesus began to say unto the multitudesconcerning john what went ye out into the wilderness to see a reedshaken with the wind   but what went ye out for to see a manclothed in soft raiment  behold they that wear soft clothing are inkings houses but what went ye out for to see a prophet yea i say unto youand more than a prophet for this is he of whom it is written behold i send mymessenger before thy face which shall prepare thy way before thee verily i say unto you among them that are born of women therehath not risen a greater than john the baptist notwithstanding hethat is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he and from the days of john the baptist until now the kingdom ofheaven suffereth violence and the violent take it by force for all the prophets and the law prophesied until john and if ye will receive it this is elias which was for to come he that hath ears to hear let him hear but whereunto shall i liken this generation it is like untochildren sitting in the markets and calling unto their fellows and saying we have piped unto you and ye have not danced we havemourned unto you and ye have not lamented for john came neither eating nor drinking and they say he hatha devil the son of man came eating and drinking and they say behold aman gluttonous and a winebibber a friend of publicans and sinnersbut wisdom is justified of her children then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mightyworks were done because they repented not  woe unto theechorazin woe unto thee bethsaida for if the mighty works whichwere done in you had been done in tyre and sidon they would haverepented long ago in sackcloth and ashes but i say unto you it shall be more tolerable for tyre andsidon at the day of judgment than for you and thou capernaum which art exalted unto heaven shalt bebrought down to hell for if the mighty works which have been done inthee had been done in sodom it would have remained until this day but i say unto you that it shall be more tolerable for the landof sodom in the day of judgment than for thee at that time jesus answered and said i thank thee o fatherlord of heaven and earth because thou hast hid these things from thewise and prudent and hast revealed them unto babes even so father for so it seemed good in thy sight all things are delivered unto me of my father and no manknoweth the son but the father neither knoweth any man the fathersave the son and he to whomsoever the son will reveal him come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden and i willgive you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for i am meek and lowlyin heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light at that time jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn andhis disciples were an hungred and began to pluck the ears of corn andto eat but when the pharisees saw it they said unto him behold thydisciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath day but he said unto them have ye not read what david did when hewas an hungred and they that were with him  how he entered intothe house of god and did eat the shewbread which was not lawful forhim to eat neither for them which were with him but only for thepriests   or have ye not read in the law how that on the sabbathdays the priests in the temple profane the sabbath and are blameless but i say unto you that in this place is one greater than thetemple but if ye had known what this meaneth i will have mercy and notsacrifice ye would not have condemned the guiltless for the son of man is lord even of the sabbath day and when he was departed thence he went into their synagogue and behold there was a man which had his hand withered andthey asked him saying is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days thatthey might accuse him and he said unto them what man shall there be among you thatshall have one sheep and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath daywill he not lay hold on it and lift it out   how much then is aman better than a sheep wherefore it is lawful to do well on thesabbath days then saith he to the man stretch forth thine hand and hestretched it forth and it was restored whole like as the other then the pharisees went out and held a council against him howthey might destroy him but when jesus knew it he withdrew himself from thence andgreat multitudes followed him and he healed them all  andcharged them that they should not make him known  that it mightbe fulfilled which was spoken by esaias the prophet saying behold my servant whom i have chosen my beloved in whom my soul iswell pleased i will put my spirit upon him and he shall shewjudgment to the gentiles he shall not strive nor cry neither shall any man hear hisvoice in the streets a bruised reed shall he not break and smoking flax shall he notquench till he send forth judgment unto victory and in his name shall the gentiles trust then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil blind anddumb and he healed him insomuch that the blind and dumb both spakeand saw and all the people were amazed and said is not this the son ofdavid   but when the pharisees heard it they said this fellowdoth not cast out devils but by beelzebub the prince of the devils and jesus knew their thoughts and said unto them every kingdomdivided against itself is brought to desolation and every city orhouse divided against itself shall not stand  and if satan castout satan he is divided against himself how shall then his kingdomstand   and if i by beelzebub cast out devils by whom do yourchildren cast them out therefore they shall be your judges but if i cast out devils by the spirit of god then the kingdomof god is come unto you or else how can one enter into a strong mans house and spoilhis goods except he first bind the strong man and then he will spoilhis house he that is not with me is against me and he that gathereth notwith me scattereth abroad wherefore i say unto you all manner of sin and blasphemy shallbe forgiven unto men but the blasphemy against the holy ghost shallnot be forgiven unto men and whosoever speaketh a word against the son of man it shallbe forgiven him but whosoever speaketh against the holy ghost itshall not be forgiven him neither in this world neither in the worldto come either make the tree good and his fruit good or else make thetree corrupt and his fruit corrupt for the tree is known by hisfruit o generation of vipers how can ye being evil speak goodthings  for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh a good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forthgood things and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forthevil things but i say unto you that every idle word that men shall speakthey shall give account thereof in the day of judgment for by thy words thou shalt be justified and by thy words thoushalt be condemned then certain of the scribes and of the pharisees answeredsaying master we would see a sign from thee but he answered and said unto them an evil and adulterousgeneration seeketh after a sign and there shall no sign be given toit but the sign of the prophet jonas  for as jonas was threedays and three nights in the whales belly so shall the son of man bethree days and three nights in the heart of the earth the men of nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generationand shall condemn it because they repented at the preaching of jonasand behold a greater than jonas is here the queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with thisgeneration and shall condemn it for she came from the uttermostparts of the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon and behold agreater than solomon is here when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man he walketh throughdry places seeking rest and findeth none then he saith i will return into my house from whence i cameout and when he is come he findeth it empty swept and garnished then goeth he and taketh with himself seven other spirits morewicked than himself and they enter in and dwell there and the laststate of that man is worse than the first even so shall it be alsounto this wicked generation while he yet talked to the people behold his mother and hisbrethren stood without desiring to speak with him then one said unto him behold thy mother and thy brethrenstand without desiring to speak with thee but he answered and said unto him that told him who is mymother  and who are my brethren   and he stretched forth hishand toward his disciples and said behold my mother and my brethren for whosoever shall do the will of my father which is in heaventhe same is my brother and sister and mother the same day went jesus out of the house and sat by the seaside and great multitudes were gathered together unto him so that hewent into a ship and sat and the whole multitude stood on the shore and he spake many things unto them in parables saying behold asower went forth to sow  and when he sowed some seeds fell bythe way side and the fowls came and devoured them up  some fellupon stony places where they had not much earth and forthwith theysprung up because they had no deepness of earth  and when thesun was up they were scorched and because they had no root theywithered away and some fell among thorns and the thorns sprung up and chokedthem  but other fell into good ground and brought forth fruitsome an hundredfold some sixtyfold some thirtyfold who hath ears to hear let him hear and the disciples came and said unto him why speakest thouunto them in parables   he answered and said unto them becauseit is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heavenbut to them it is not given for whosoever hath to him shall be given and he shall havemore abundance but whosoever hath not from him shall be taken awayeven that he hath therefore speak i to them in parables because they seeing seenot and hearing they hear not neither do they understand and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of esaias which saith byhearing ye shall hear and shall not understand and seeing ye shallsee and shall not perceive  for this peoples heart is waxedgross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes they haveclosed lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear withtheir ears and should understand with their heart and should beconverted and i should heal them but blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for theyhear for verily i say unto you that many prophets and righteous menhave desired to see those things which ye see and have not seen themand to hear those things which ye hear and have not heard them hear ye therefore the parable of the sower when any one heareth the word of the kingdom and understandethit not then cometh the wicked one and catcheth away that which wassown in his heart this is he which received seed by the way side but he that received the seed into stony places the same is hethat heareth the word and anon with joy receiveth it  yet hathhe not root in himself but dureth for a while for when tribulationor persecution ariseth because of the word by and by he is offended he also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareththe word and the care of this world and the deceitfulness of richeschoke the word and he becometh unfruitful but he that received seed into the good ground is he thatheareth the word and understandeth it which also beareth fruit andbringeth forth some an hundredfold some sixty some thirty another parable put he forth unto them saying the kingdom ofheaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field but while men slept his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheatand went his way but when the blade was sprung up and brought forth fruit thenappeared the tares also so the servants of the householder came and said unto him sirdidst not thou sow good seed in thy field from whence then hath ittares   he said unto them an enemy hath done this the servantssaid unto him wilt thou then that we go and gather them up  but he said nay lest while ye gather up the tares ye root up alsothe wheat with them let both grow together until the harvest and in the time ofharvest i will say to the reapers gather ye together first the taresand bind them in bundles to burn them but gather the wheat into mybarn another parable put he forth unto them saying the kingdom ofheaven is like to a grain of mustard seed which a man took and sowedin his field  which indeed is the least of all seeds but whenit is grown it is the greatest among herbs and becometh a tree sothat the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof another parable spake he unto them the kingdom of heaven islike unto leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures ofmeal till the whole was leavened all these things spake jesus unto the multitude in parables andwithout a parable spake he not unto them  that it might befulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying i will open mymouth in parables i will utter things which have been kept secretfrom the foundation of the world then jesus sent the multitude away and went into the house andhis disciples came unto him saying declare unto us the parable ofthe tares of the field he answered and said unto them he that soweth the good seed isthe son of man  the field is the world the good seed are thechildren of the kingdom but the tares are the children of the wickedone  the enemy that sowed them is the devil the harvest is theend of the world and the reapers are the angels as therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire soshall it be in the end of this world the son of man shall send forth his angels and they shallgather out of his kingdom all things that offend and them which doiniquity  and shall cast them into a furnace of fire thereshall be wailing and gnashing of teeth then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdomof their father who hath ears to hear let him hear again the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in afield the which when a man hath found he hideth and for joy thereofgoeth and selleth all that he hath and buyeth that field again the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant manseeking goodly pearls  who when he had found one pearl of greatprice went and sold all that he had and bought it again the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net that was castinto the sea and gathered of every kind  which when it wasfull they drew to shore and sat down and gathered the good intovessels but cast the bad away so shall it be at the end of the world the angels shall comeforth and sever the wicked from among the just  and shall castthem into the furnace of fire there shall be wailing and gnashing ofteeth jesus saith unto them have ye understood all these things theysay unto him yea lord then said he unto them therefore every scribe which isinstructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is anhouseholder which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new andold and it came to pass that when jesus had finished theseparables he departed thence and when he was come into his own country he taught them intheir synagogue insomuch that they were astonished and said whencehath this man this wisdom and these mighty works   is not thisthe carpenters son is not his mother called mary and his brethrenjames and joses and simon and judas   and his sisters arethey not all with us whence then hath this man all these things and they were offended in him but jesus said unto them aprophet is not without honour save in his own country and in his ownhouse and he did not many mighty works there because of theirunbelief at that time herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of jesus and said unto his servants this is john the baptist he is risen fromthe dead and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him for herod had laid hold on john and bound him and put him inprison for herodias sake his brother philips wife for john said unto him it is not lawful for thee to have her and when he would have put him to death he feared the multitudebecause they counted him as a prophet but when herods birthday was kept the daughter of herodiasdanced before them and pleased herod whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever shewould ask and she being before instructed of her mother said give mehere john baptists head in a charger and the king was sorry nevertheless for the oaths sake andthem which sat with him at meat he commanded it to be given her and he sent and beheaded john in the prison and his head was brought in a charger and given to the damseland she brought it to her mother and his disciples came and took up the body and buried it andwent and told jesus when jesus heard of it he departed thence by ship into a desertplace apart and when the people had heard thereof they followed himon foot out of the cities and jesus went forth and saw a great multitude and was movedwith compassion toward them and he healed their sick and when it was evening his disciples came to him saying thisis a desert place and the time is now past send the multitude awaythat they may go into the villages and buy themselves victuals but jesus said unto them they need not depart give ye them toeat and they say unto him we have here but five loaves and twofishes he said bring them hither to me and he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass andtook the five loaves and the two fishes and looking up to heaven heblessed and brake and gave the loaves to his disciples and thedisciples to the multitude and they did all eat and were filled and they took up of thefragments that remained twelve baskets full and they that had eaten were about five thousand men besidewomen and children and straightway jesus constrained his disciples to get into aship and to go before him unto the other side while he sent themultitudes away and when he had sent the multitudes away he went up into amountain apart to pray and when the evening was come he was therealone but the ship was now in the midst of the sea tossed with wavesfor the wind was contrary and in the fourth watch of the night jesus went unto themwalking on the sea and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they weretroubled saying it is a spirit and they cried out for fear but straightway jesus spake unto them saying be of good cheerit is i be not afraid and peter answered him and said lord if it be thou bid mecome unto thee on the water and he said come and when peter was come down out of the shiphe walked on the water to go to jesus but when he saw the wind boisterous he was afraid andbeginning to sink he cried saying lord save me and immediately jesus stretched forth his hand and caught himand said unto him o thou of little faith wherefore didst thou doubt and when they were come into the ship the wind ceased then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him sayingof a truth thou art the son of god and when they were gone over they came into the land ofgennesaret and when the men of that place had knowledge of him they sentout into all that country round about and brought unto him all thatwere diseased  and besought him that they might only touch thehem of his garment and as many as touched were made perfectly whole then came to jesus scribes and pharisees which were ofjerusalem saying  why do thy disciples transgress the traditionof the elders for they wash not their hands when they eat bread but he answered and said unto them why do ye also transgress thecommandment of god by your tradition   for god commanded sayinghonour thy father and mother and he that curseth father or motherlet him die the death but ye say whosoever shall say to his father or his mother itis a gift by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me  andhonour not his father or his mother he shall be free thus have yemade the commandment of god of none effect by your tradition ye hypocrites well did esaias prophesy of you saying  thispeople draweth nigh unto me with their mouth and honoureth me withtheir lips but their heart is far from me but in vain they do worship me teaching for doctrines thecommandments of men and he called the multitude and said unto them hear andunderstand  not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a manbut that which cometh out of the mouth this defileth a man then came his disciples and said unto him knowest thou thatthe pharisees were offended after they heard this saying   buthe answered and said every plant which my heavenly father hath notplanted shall be rooted up let them alone they be blind leaders of the blind and if theblind lead the blind both shall fall into the ditch then answered peter and said unto him declare unto us thisparable and jesus said are ye also yet without understanding   donot ye yet understand that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goethinto the belly and is cast out into the draught   but thosethings which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart andthey defile the man for out of the heart proceed evil thoughts murders adulteriesfornications thefts false witness blasphemies  these are thethings which defile a man but to eat with unwashen hands defileth nota man then jesus went thence and departed into the coasts of tyre andsidon and behold a woman of canaan came out of the same coasts andcried unto him saying have mercy on me o lord thou son of davidmy daughter is grievously vexed with a devil but he answered her not a word and his disciples came andbesought him saying send her away for she crieth after us but he answered and said i am not sent but unto the lost sheepof the house of israel then came she and worshipped him saying lord help me but he answered and said it is not meet to take the childrensbread and to cast it to dogs and she said truth lord yet the dogs eat of the crumbs whichfall from their masters table then jesus answered and said unto her o woman great is thyfaith be it unto thee even as thou wilt and her daughter was madewhole from that very hour and jesus departed from thence and came nigh unto the sea ofgalilee and went up into a mountain and sat down there and great multitudes came unto him having with them those thatwere lame blind dumb maimed and many others and cast them down atjesus feet and he healed them  insomuch that the multitudewondered when they saw the dumb to speak the maimed to be whole thelame to walk and the blind to see and they glorified the god ofisrael then jesus called his disciples unto him and said i havecompassion on the multitude because they continue with me now threedays and have nothing to eat and i will not send them away fastinglest they faint in the way and his disciples say unto him whence should we have so muchbread in the wilderness as to fill so great a multitude   andjesus saith unto them how many loaves have ye and they said sevenand a few little fishes and he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground and he took the seven loaves and the fishes and gave thanksand brake them and gave to his disciples and the disciples to themultitude and they did all eat and were filled and they took up of thebroken meat that was left seven baskets full and they that did eat were four thousand men beside women andchildren and he sent away the multitude and took ship and came into thecoasts of magdala the pharisees also with the sadducees came and tempting desiredhim that he would shew them a sign from heaven he answered and said unto them when it is evening ye say itwill be fair weather for the sky is red and in the morning it will be foul weather to day for the skyis red and lowering o ye hypocrites ye can discern the face of thesky but can ye not discern the signs of the times   a wicked andadulterous generation seeketh after a sign and there shall no sign begiven unto it but the sign of the prophet jonas and he left themand departed and when his disciples were come to the other side they hadforgotten to take bread then jesus said unto them take heed and beware of the leaven ofthe pharisees and of the sadducees and they reasoned among themselves saying it is because we havetaken no bread which when jesus perceived he said unto them o ye of littlefaith why reason ye among yourselves because ye have brought nobread   do ye not yet understand neither remember the fiveloaves of the five thousand and how many baskets ye took up  neither the seven loaves of the four thousand and how many baskets yetook up   how is it that ye do not understand that i spake itnot to you concerning bread that ye should beware of the leaven ofthe pharisees and of the sadducees   then understood they howthat he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread but of thedoctrine of the pharisees and of the sadducees when jesus came into the coasts of caesarea philippi he askedhis disciples saying whom do men say that i the son of man am and they said some say that thou art john the baptist someelias and others jeremias or one of the prophets he saith unto them but whom say ye that i am   and simonpeter answered and said thou art the christ the son of the livinggod and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simonbarjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but myfather which is in heaven and i say also unto thee that thou art peter and upon thisrock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevailagainst it and i will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven andwhatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven andwhatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man thathe was jesus the christ from that time forth began jesus to shew unto his disciples howthat he must go unto jerusalem and suffer many things of the eldersand chief priests and scribes and be killed and be raised again thethird day then peter took him and began to rebuke him saying be it farfrom thee lord this shall not be unto thee but he turned and said unto peter get thee behind me satanthou art an offence unto me for thou savourest not the things that beof god but those that be of men then said jesus unto his disciples if any man will come afterme let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it and whosoeverwill lose his life for my sake shall find it for what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole worldand lose his own soul or what shall a man give in exchange for hissoul   for the son of man shall come in the glory of his fatherwith his angels and then he shall reward every man according to hisworks verily i say unto you there be some standing here which shallnot taste of death till they see the son of man coming in hiskingdom and after six days jesus taketh peter james and john hisbrother and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart  andwas transfigured before them and his face did shine as the sun andhis raiment was white as the light and behold there appeared unto them moses and elias talkingwith him then answered peter and said unto jesus lord it is good for usto be here if thou wilt let us make here three tabernacles one forthee and one for moses and one for elias while he yet spake behold a bright cloud overshadowed them andbehold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved sonin whom i am well pleased hear ye him and when the disciples heard it they fell on their face andwere sore afraid and jesus came and touched them and said arise and be notafraid and when they had lifted up their eyes they saw no man savejesus only and as they came down from the mountain jesus charged themsaying tell the vision to no man until the son of man be risen againfrom the dead and his disciples asked him saying why then say the scribesthat elias must first come   and jesus answered and said untothem elias truly shall first come and restore all things but i say unto you that elias is come already and they knewhim not but have done unto him whatsoever they listed likewise shallalso the son of man suffer of them then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of johnthe baptist and when they were come to the multitude there came to him acertain man kneeling down to him and saying  lord have mercyon my son for he is lunatick and sore vexed for ofttimes he fallethinto the fire and oft into the water and i brought him to thy disciples and they could not cure him then jesus answered and said o faithless and perversegeneration how long shall i be with you how long shall i suffer youbring him hither to me and jesus rebuked the devil and he departed out of him and thechild was cured from that very hour then came the disciples to jesus apart and said why could notwe cast him out   and jesus said unto them because of yourunbelief for verily i say unto you if ye have faith as a grain ofmustard seed ye shall say unto this mountain remove hence to yonderplace and it shall remove and nothing shall be impossible unto you howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting and while they abode in galilee jesus said unto them the sonof man shall be betrayed into the hands of men  and they shallkill him and the third day he shall be raised againand they were exceeding sorry and when they were come to capernaum they that received tributemoney came to peter and said doth not your master pay tribute he saith yes and when he was come into the house jesusprevented him saying what thinkest thou simon of whom do the kingsof the earth take custom or tribute of their own children or ofstrangers   peter saith unto him of strangers jesus saith untohim then are the children free notwithstanding lest we should offend them go thou to the seaand cast an hook and take up the fish that first cometh up and whenthou hast opened his mouth thou shalt find a piece of money thattake and give unto them for me and thee at the same time came the disciples unto jesus saying who isthe greatest in the kingdom of heaven   and jesus called a littlechild unto him and set him in the midst of them  and saidverily i say unto you except ye be converted and become as littlechildren ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little childthe same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven and whoso shall receive one such little child in my namereceiveth me but whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe inme it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about hisneck and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea woe unto the world because of offences for it must needs be thatoffences come but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh  wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee cut them off and castthem from thee it is better for thee to enter into life halt ormaimed rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast intoeverlasting fire and if thine eye offend thee pluck it out and cast it fromthee it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye ratherthan having two eyes to be cast into hell fire take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones for isay unto you that in heaven their angels do always behold the face ofmy father which is in heaven for the son of man is come to save that which was lost how think ye if a man have an hundred sheep and one of them begone astray doth he not leave the ninety and nine and goeth into themountains and seeketh that which is gone astray   and if so bethat he find it verily i say unto you he rejoiceth more of thatsheep than of the ninety and nine which went not astray even so it is not the will of your father which is in heaventhat one of these little ones should perish moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee go and tellhim his fault between thee and him alone if he shall hear thee thouhast gained thy brother but if he will not hear thee then take with thee one or twomore that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may beestablished and if he shall neglect to hear them tell it unto the churchbut if he neglect to hear the church let him be unto thee as anheathen man and a publican verily i say unto you whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shallbe bound in heaven and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall beloosed in heaven again i say unto you that if two of you shall agree on earth astouching any thing that they shall ask it shall be done for them ofmy father which is in heaven for where two or three are gathered together in my name theream i in the midst of them then came peter to him and said lord how oft shall my brothersin against me and i forgive him till seven times   jesussaith unto him i say not unto thee until seven times but untilseventy times seven therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain kingwhich would take account of his servants and when he had begun to reckon one was brought unto him whichowed him ten thousand talents but forasmuch as he had not to pay his lord commanded him to besold and his wife and children and all that he had and payment tobe made the servant therefore fell down and worshipped him sayinglord have patience with me and i will pay thee all then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion andloosed him and forgave him the debt but the same servant went out and found one of hisfellowservants which owed him an hundred pence and he laid hands onhim and took him by the throat saying pay me that thou owest and his fellowservant fell down at his feet and besought himsaying have patience with me and i will pay thee all and he would not but went and cast him into prison till heshould pay the debt so when his fellowservants saw what was done they were verysorry and came and told unto their lord all that was done then his lord after that he had called him said unto him othou wicked servant i forgave thee all that debt because thoudesiredst me  shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thyfellowservant even as i had pity on thee   and his lord waswroth and delivered him to the tormentors till he should pay allthat was due unto him so likewise shall my heavenly father do also unto you if yefrom your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses and it came to pass that when jesus had finished these sayingshe departed from galilee and came into the coasts of judaea beyondjordan  and great multitudes followed him and he healed themthere the pharisees also came unto him tempting him and saying untohim is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause and he answered and said unto them have ye not read that hewhich made them at the beginning made them male and female  andsaid for this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shallcleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh   whereforethey are no more twain but one flesh what therefore god hath joinedtogether let not man put asunder they say unto him why did moses then command to give a writingof divorcement and to put her away   he saith unto them mosesbecause of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away yourwives but from the beginning it was not so and i say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife except itbe for fornication and shall marry another committeth adultery andwhoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery his disciples say unto him if the case of the man be so withhis wife it is not good to marry but he said unto them all men cannot receive this saying savethey to whom it is given for there are some eunuchs which were so born from theirmothers womb and there are some eunuchs which were made eunuchs ofmen and there be eunuchs which have made themselves eunuchs for thekingdom of heavens sake he that is able to receive it let himreceive it then were there brought unto him little children that he shouldput his hands on them and pray and the disciples rebuked them but jesus said suffer little children and forbid them not tocome unto me for of such is the kingdom of heaven and he laid his hands on them and departed thence and behold one came and said unto him good master what goodthing shall i do that i may have eternal life   and he saidunto him why callest thou me good there is none good but one thatis god but if thou wilt enter into life keep the commandments he saith unto him which jesus said thou shalt do no murderthou shalt not commit adultery thou shalt not steal thou shalt notbear false witness  honour thy father and thy mother and thoushalt love thy neighbour as thyself the young man saith unto him all these things have i kept frommy youth up what lack i yet   jesus said unto him if thou wiltbe perfect go and sell that thou hast and give to the poor and thoushalt have treasure in heaven and come and follow me but when the young man heard that saying he went awaysorrowful for he had great possessions then said jesus unto his disciples verily i say unto you thata rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven and again i say unto you it is easier for a camel to go throughthe eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom ofgod when his disciples heard it they were exceedingly amazedsaying who then can be saved   but jesus beheld them and saidunto them with men this is impossible but with god all things arepossible then answered peter and said unto him behold we have forsakenall and followed thee what shall we have therefore   and jesussaid unto them verily i say unto you that ye which have followed mein the regeneration when the son of man shall sit in the throne of hisglory ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones judging the twelvetribes of israel and every one that hath forsaken houses or brethren orsisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for mynames sake shall receive an hundredfold and shall inheriteverlasting life but many that are first shall be last and the last shall befirst for the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is anhouseholder which went out early in the morning to hire labourersinto his vineyard and when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day hesent them into his vineyard and he went out about the third hour and saw others standingidle in the marketplace  and said unto them go ye also into thevineyard and whatsoever is right i will give you and they went theirway again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour and didlikewise and about the eleventh hour he went out and found othersstanding idle and saith unto them why stand ye here all the dayidle   they say unto him because no man hath hired us he saithunto them go ye also into the vineyard and whatsoever is right thatshall ye receive so when even was come the lord of the vineyard saith unto hissteward call the labourers and give them their hire beginning fromthe last unto the first and when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour theyreceived every man a penny but when the first came they supposed that they should havereceived more and they likewise received every man a penny and when they had received it they murmured against the goodmanof the house  saying these last have wrought but one hour andthou hast made them equal unto us which have borne the burden andheat of the day but he answered one of them and said friend i do thee nowrong didst not thou agree with me for a penny   take thatthine is and go thy way i will give unto this last even as untothee is it not lawful for me to do what i will with mine own isthine eye evil because i am good   so the last shall be firstand the first last for many be called but few chosen and jesus going up to jerusalem took the twelve disciples apartin the way and said unto them  behold we go up to jerusalemand the son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and untothe scribes and they shall condemn him to death  and shalldeliver him to the gentiles to mock and to scourge and to crucifyhim and the third day he shall rise again then came to him the mother of zebedees children with her sonsworshipping him and desiring a certain thing of him and he said unto her what wilt thou she saith unto him grantthat these my two sons may sit the one on thy right hand and theother on the left in thy kingdom but jesus answered and said ye know not what ye ask are yeable to drink of the cup that i shall drink of and to be baptizedwith the baptism that i am baptized with they say unto him we areable and he saith unto them ye shall drink indeed of my cup and bebaptized with the baptism that i am baptized with but to sit on myright hand and on my left is not mine to give but it shall be givento them for whom it is prepared of my father and when the ten heard it they were moved with indignationagainst the two brethren but jesus called them unto him and said ye know that theprinces of the gentiles exercise dominion over them and they that aregreat exercise authority upon them but it shall not be so among you but whosoever will be greatamong you let him be your minister  and whosoever will be chiefamong you let him be your servant  even as the son of man camenot to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life aransom for many and as they departed from jericho a great multitude followedhim and behold two blind men sitting by the way side when theyheard that jesus passed by cried out saying have mercy on us olord thou son of david and the multitude rebuked them because they should hold theirpeace but they cried the more saying have mercy on us o lord thouson of david and jesus stood still and called them and said what will yethat i shall do unto you   they say unto him lord that oureyes may be opened so jesus had compassion on them and touched their eyes andimmediately their eyes received sight and they followed him and when they drew nigh unto jerusalem and were come tobethphage unto the mount of olives then sent jesus two disciples saying unto them go into the village over against you andstraightway ye shall find an ass tied and a colt with her loosethem and bring them unto me and if any man say ought unto you ye shall say the lord hathneed of them and straightway he will send them all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken bythe prophet saying  tell ye the daughter of sion behold thyking cometh unto thee meek and sitting upon an ass and a colt thefoal of an ass and the disciples went and did as jesus commanded them  andbrought the ass and the colt and put on them their clothes and theyset him thereon and a very great multitude spread their garments in the wayothers cut down branches from the trees and strawed them in the way and the multitudes that went before and that followed criedsaying hosanna to the son of david blessed is he that cometh in thename of the lord hosanna in the highest and when he was come into jerusalem all the city was movedsaying who is this   and the multitude said this is jesus theprophet of nazareth of galilee and jesus went into the temple of god and cast out all themthat sold and bought in the temple and overthrew the tables of themoneychangers and the seats of them that sold doves  and saidunto them it is written my house shall be called the house ofprayer but ye have made it a den of thieves and the blind and the lame came to him in the temple and hehealed them and when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful thingsthat he did and the children crying in the temple and sayinghosanna to the son of david they were sore displeased  and saidunto him hearest thou what these say and jesus saith unto them yeahave ye never read out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hastperfected praise   and he left them and went out of the cityinto bethany and he lodged there now in the morning as he returned into the city he hungered and when he saw a fig tree in the way he came to it and foundnothing thereon but leaves only and said unto it let no fruit growon thee henceforward for ever and presently the fig tree witheredaway and when the disciples saw it they marvelled saying how soonis the fig tree withered away   jesus answered and said untothem verily i say unto you if ye have faith and doubt not ye shallnot only do this which is done to the fig tree but also if ye shallsay unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into thesea it shall be done and all things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer believing yeshall receive and when he was come into the temple the chief priests and theelders of the people came unto him as he was teaching and said bywhat authority doest thou these things and who gave thee thisauthority   and jesus answered and said unto them i also willask you one thing which if ye tell me i in like wise will tell youby what authority i do these things the baptism of john whence was it from heaven or of men andthey reasoned with themselves saying if we shall say from heavenhe will say unto us why did ye not then believe him   but if weshall say of men we fear the people for all hold john as a prophet and they answered jesus and said we cannot tell and he saidunto them neither tell i you by what authority i do these things but what think ye a certain man had two sons and he came tothe first and said son go work to day in my vineyard he answered and said i will not but afterward he repented andwent and he came to the second and said likewise and he answeredand said i go sir and went not whether of them twain did the will of his father they say untohim the first jesus saith unto them verily i say unto you that thepublicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of god before you for john came unto you in the way of righteousness and yebelieved him not but the publicans and the harlots believed him andye when ye had seen it repented not afterward that ye might believehim hear another parable there was a certain householder whichplanted a vineyard and hedged it round about and digged a winepressin it and built a tower and let it out to husbandmen and went intoa far country  and when the time of the fruit drew near he senthis servants to the husbandmen that they might receive the fruits ofit and the husbandmen took his servants and beat one and killedanother and stoned another again he sent other servants more than the first and they didunto them likewise but last of all he sent unto them his son saying they willreverence my son but when the husbandmen saw the son they said among themselvesthis is the heir come let us kill him and let us seize on hisinheritance and they caught him and cast him out of the vineyard and slewhim when the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh what will he dounto those husbandmen   they say unto him he will miserablydestroy those wicked men and will let out his vineyard unto otherhusbandmen which shall render him the fruits in their seasons jesus saith unto them did ye never read in the scriptures thestone which the builders rejected the same is become the head of thecorner this is the lords doing and it is marvellous in our eyes therefore say i unto you the kingdom of god shall be taken fromyou and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof and whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken but onwhomsoever it shall fall it will grind him to powder and when the chief priests and pharisees had heard his parablesthey perceived that he spake of them but when they sought to lay hands on him they feared themultitude because they took him for a prophet and jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables andsaid  the kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king whichmade a marriage for his son  and sent forth his servants to callthem that were bidden to the wedding and they would not come again he sent forth other servants saying tell them which arebidden behold i have prepared my dinner my oxen and my fatlings arekilled and all things are ready come unto the marriage but they made light of it and went their ways one to his farmanother to his merchandise  and the remnant took his servantsand entreated them spitefully and slew them but when the king heard thereof he was wroth and he sent forthhis armies and destroyed those murderers and burned up their city then saith he to his servants the wedding is ready but theywhich were bidden were not worthy go ye therefore into the highways and as many as ye shall findbid to the marriage so those servants went out into the highways and gatheredtogether all as many as they found both bad and good and the weddingwas furnished with guests and when the king came in to see the guests he saw there a manwhich had not on a wedding garment  and he saith unto himfriend how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment and hewas speechless then said the king to the servants bind him hand and foot andtake him away and cast him into outer darkness there shall beweeping and gnashing of teeth for many are called but few are chosen then went the pharisees and took counsel how they mightentangle him in his talk and they sent out unto him their disciples with the herodianssaying master we know that thou art true and teachest the way ofgod in truth neither carest thou for any man for thou regardest notthe person of men tell us therefore what thinkest thou is it lawful to givetribute unto caesar or not   but jesus perceived theirwickedness and said why tempt ye me ye hypocrites   shew methe tribute money and they brought unto him a penny and he saith unto them whose is this image and superscription they say unto him caesars then saith he unto them rendertherefore unto caesar the things which are caesars and unto god thethings that are gods when they had heard these words they marvelled and left himand went their way the same day came to him the sadducees which say that there isno resurrection and asked him  saying master moses said if aman die having no children his brother shall marry his wife andraise up seed unto his brother now there were with us seven brethren and the first when hehad married a wife deceased and having no issue left his wife untohis brother  likewise the second also and the third unto theseventh and last of all the woman died also therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of theseven  for they all had her jesus answered and said unto them ye do err not knowing thescriptures nor the power of god for in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given inmarriage but are as the angels of god in heaven but as touching the resurrection of the dead have ye not readthat which was spoken unto you by god saying  i am the god ofabraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob  god is not thegod of the dead but of the living and when the multitude heard this they were astonished at hisdoctrine but when the pharisees had heard that he had put the sadduceesto silence they were gathered together then one of them which was a lawyer asked him a questiontempting him and saying  master which is the great commandmentin the law   jesus said unto him thou shalt love the lord thygod with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind this is the first and great commandment and the second is like unto it thou shalt love thy neighbour asthyself on these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets while the pharisees were gathered together jesus asked them saying what think ye of christ whose son is he they say untohim the son of david he saith unto them how then doth david in spirit call him lordsaying  the lord said unto my lord sit thou on my right handtill i make thine enemies thy footstool   if david then call himlord how is he his son   and no man was able to answer him aword neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any morequestions then spake jesus to the multitude and to his disciples saying the scribes and the pharisees sit in moses seat  alltherefore whatsoever they bid you observe that observe and do but donot ye after their works for they say and do not for they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne and laythem on mens shoulders but they themselves will not move them withone of their fingers but all their works they do for to be seen of men they makebroad their phylacteries and enlarge the borders of their garments and love the uppermost rooms at feasts and the chief seats inthe synagogues  and greetings in the markets and to be called ofmen rabbi rabbi but be not ye called rabbi for one is your master even christand all ye are brethren and call no man your father upon the earth for one is yourfather which is in heaven neither be ye called masters for one is your master evenchrist but he that is greatest among you shall be your servant and whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased and he thatshall humble himself shall be exalted but woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye shutup the kingdom of heaven against men for ye neither go in yourselvesneither suffer ye them that are entering to go in woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye devourwidows houses and for a pretence make long prayer therefore yeshall receive the greater damnation woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye compasssea and land to make one proselyte and when he is made ye make himtwofold more the child of hell than yourselves woe unto you ye blind guides which say whosoever shall swearby the temple it is nothing but whosoever shall swear by the gold ofthe temple he is a debtor   ye fools and blind for whether isgreater the gold or the temple that sanctifieth the gold  and whosoever shall swear by the altar it is nothing but whosoeversweareth by the gift that is upon it he is guilty ye fools and blind for whether is greater the gift or thealtar that sanctifieth the gift   whoso therefore shall swear bythe altar sweareth by it and by all things thereon and whoso shall swear by the temple sweareth by it and by himthat dwelleth therein and he that shall swear by heaven sweareth by the throne ofgod and by him that sitteth thereon woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye paytithe of mint and anise and cummin and have omitted the weightiermatters of the law judgment mercy and faith these ought ye to havedone and not to leave the other undone ye blind guides which strain at a gnat and swallow a camel woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye makeclean the outside of the cup and of the platter but within they arefull of extortion and excess thou blind pharisee cleanse first that which is within the cupand platter that the outside of them may be clean also woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye are likeunto whited sepulchres which indeed appear beautiful outward but arewithin full of dead mens bones and of all uncleanness even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men but withinye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites because yebuild the tombs of the prophets and garnish the sepulchres of therighteous  and say if we had been in the days of our fatherswe would not have been partakers with them in the blood of theprophets wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves that ye are thechildren of them which killed the prophets fill ye up then the measure of your fathers ye serpents ye generation of vipers how can ye escape thedamnation of hell   wherefore behold i send unto you prophetsand wise men and scribes and some of them ye shall kill and crucifyand some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues and persecutethem from city to city  that upon you may come all the righteousblood shed upon the earth from the blood of righteous abel unto theblood of zacharias son of barachias whom ye slew between the templeand the altar verily i say unto you all these things shall come upon thisgeneration o jerusalem jerusalem thou that killest the prophets andstonest them which are sent unto thee how often would i have gatheredthy children together even as a hen gathereth her chickens under herwings and ye would not   behold your house is left unto youdesolate for i say unto you ye shall not see me henceforth till yeshall say blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord and jesus went out and departed from the temple and hisdisciples came to him for to shew him the buildings of the temple and jesus said unto them see ye not all these things verily isay unto you there shall not be left here one stone upon anotherthat shall not be thrown down and as he sat upon the mount of olives the disciples came untohim privately saying tell us when shall these things be and whatshall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world  and jesus answered and said unto them take heed that no man deceiveyou for many shall come in my name saying i am christ and shalldeceive many and ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars see that ye be nottroubled for all these things must come to pass but the end is notyet for nation shall rise against nation and kingdom againstkingdom and there shall be famines and pestilences and earthquakesin divers places all these are the beginning of sorrows then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and shall killyou and ye shall be hated of all nations for my names sake and then shall many be offended and shall betray one anotherand shall hate one another and many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall waxcold but he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be saved and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all theworld for a witness unto all nations and then shall the end come when ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolationspoken of by daniel the prophet stand in the holy place whosoreadeth let him understand  then let them which be in judaeaflee into the mountains  let him which is on the housetop notcome down to take any thing out of his house  neither let himwhich is in the field return back to take his clothes and woe unto them that are with child and to them that givesuck in those days   but pray ye that your flight be not in thewinter neither on the sabbath day  for then shall be greattribulation such as was not since the beginning of the world to thistime no nor ever shall be and except those days should be shortened there should no fleshbe saved but for the elects sake those days shall be shortened then if any man shall say unto you lo here is christ orthere believe it not for there shall arise false christs and false prophets andshall shew great signs and wonders insomuch that if it werepossible they shall deceive the very elect behold i have told you before wherefore if they shall say unto you behold he is in thedesert go not forth behold he is in the secret chambers believe itnot for as the lightning cometh out of the east and shineth evenunto the west so shall also the coming of the son of man be for wheresoever the carcase is there will the eagles begathered together immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun bedarkened and the moon shall not give her light and the stars shallfall from heaven and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken and then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven and thenshall all the tribes of the earth mourn and they shall see the son ofman coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory and he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpetand they shall gather together his elect from the four winds from oneend of heaven to the other now learn a parable of the fig tree when his branch is yettender and putteth forth leaves ye know that summer is nigh so likewise ye when ye shall see all these things know that it isnear even at the doors verily i say unto you this generation shall not pass till allthese things be fulfilled heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not passaway but of that day and hour knoweth no man no not the angels ofheaven but my father only but as the days of noe were so shall also the coming of the sonof man be for as in the days that were before the flood they were eatingand drinking marrying and giving in marriage until the day that noeentered into the ark  and knew not until the flood came andtook them all away so shall also the coming of the son of man be then shall two be in the field the one shall be taken and theother left two women shall be grinding at the mill the one shall be takenand the other left watch therefore for ye know not what hour your lord doth come but know this that if the goodman of the house had known inwhat watch the thief would come he would have watched and would nothave suffered his house to be broken up therefore be ye also ready for in such an hour as ye think notthe son of man cometh who then is a faithful and wise servant whom his lord hath maderuler over his household to give them meat in due season  blessed is that servant whom his lord when he cometh shall find sodoing verily i say unto you that he shall make him ruler over all hisgoods but and if that evil servant shall say in his heart my lorddelayeth his coming  and shall begin to smite hisfellowservants and to eat and drink with the drunken  the lordof that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him andin an hour that he is not aware of  and shall cut him asunderand appoint him his portion with the hypocrites there shall beweeping and gnashing of teeth then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virginswhich took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom and five of them were wise and five were foolish they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil withthem  but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps while the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroomcometh go ye out to meet him then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps and the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil for ourlamps are gone out but the wise answered saying not so lest there be not enoughfor us and you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy foryourselves and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they thatwere ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut afterward came also the other virgins saying lord lord opento us but he answered and said verily i say unto you i know you not watch therefore for ye know neither the day nor the hourwherein the son of man cometh for the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a farcountry who called his own servants and delivered unto them hisgoods and unto one he gave five talents to another two and toanother one to every man according to his several ability andstraightway took his journey then he that had received the five talents went and traded withthe same and made them other five talents and likewise he that had received two he also gained other two but he that had received one went and digged in the earth andhid his lords money after a long time the lord of those servants cometh andreckoneth with them and so he that had received five talents came and brought otherfive talents saying lord thou deliveredst unto me five talentsbehold i have gained beside them five talents more his lord said unto him well done thou good and faithfulservant thou hast been faithful over a few things i will make theeruler over many things enter thou into the joy of thy lord he also that had received two talents came and said lord thoudeliveredst unto me two talents behold i have gained two othertalents beside them his lord said unto him well done good and faithful servantthou hast been faithful over a few things i will make thee ruler overmany things enter thou into the joy of thy lord then he which had received the one talent came and said lord iknew thee that thou art an hard man reaping where thou hast not sownand gathering where thou hast not strawed  and i was afraid andwent and hid thy talent in the earth lo there thou hast that isthine his lord answered and said unto him thou wicked and slothfulservant thou knewest that i reap where i sowed not and gather wherei have not strawed  thou oughtest therefore to have put my moneyto the exchangers and then at my coming i should have received mineown with usury take therefore the talent from him and give it unto him whichhath ten talents for unto every one that hath shall be given and he shall haveabundance but from him that hath not shall be taken away even thatwhich he hath and cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness thereshall be weeping and gnashing of teeth when the son of man shall come in his glory and all the holyangels with him then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory and before him shall be gathered all nations and he shall separatethem one from another as a shepherd divideth his sheep from thegoats  and he shall set the sheep on his right hand but thegoats on the left then shall the king say unto them on his right hand come yeblessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from thefoundation of the world  for i was an hungred and ye gave memeat i was thirsty and ye gave me drink i was a stranger and yetook me in  naked and ye clothed me i was sick and ye visitedme i was in prison and ye came unto me then shall the righteous answer him saying lord when saw wethee an hungred and fed thee or thirsty and gave thee drink  when saw we thee a stranger and took thee in or naked and clothedthee   or when saw we thee sick or in prison and came untothee   and the king shall answer and say unto them verily i sayunto you inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of thesemy brethren ye have done it unto me then shall he say also unto them on the left hand depart fromme ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and hisangels  for i was an hungred and ye gave me no meat i wasthirsty and ye gave me no drink  i was a stranger and ye tookme not in naked and ye clothed me not sick and in prison and yevisited me not then shall they also answer him saying lord when saw we theean hungred or athirst or a stranger or naked or sick or inprison and did not minister unto thee   then shall he answerthem saying verily i say unto you inasmuch as ye did it not to oneof the least of these ye did it not to me and these shall go away into everlasting punishment but therighteous into life eternal and it came to pass when jesus had finished all these sayingshe said unto his disciples  ye know that after two days is thefeast of the passover and the son of man is betrayed to be crucified then assembled together the chief priests and the scribes andthe elders of the people unto the palace of the high priest who wascalled caiaphas  and consulted that they might take jesus bysubtilty and kill him but they said not on the feast day lest there be an uproaramong the people now when jesus was in bethany in the house of simon the leper there came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of veryprecious ointment and poured it on his head as he sat at meat but when his disciples saw it they had indignation saying towhat purpose is this waste   for this ointment might have beensold for much and given to the poor when jesus understood it he said unto them why trouble ye thewoman for she hath wrought a good work upon me for ye have the poor always with you but me ye have not always for in that she hath poured this ointment on my body she did itfor my burial verily i say unto you wheresoever this gospel shall be preachedin the whole world there shall also this that this woman hath donebe told for a memorial of her then one of the twelve called judas iscariot went unto thechief priests  and said unto them what will ye give me and iwill deliver him unto you and they covenanted with him for thirtypieces of silver and from that time he sought opportunity to betray him now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciplescame to jesus saying unto him where wilt thou that we prepare forthee to eat the passover   and he said go into the city to sucha man and say unto him the master saith my time is at hand i willkeep the passover at thy house with my disciples and the disciples did as jesus had appointed them and they madeready the passover now when the even was come he sat down with the twelve and as they did eat he said verily i say unto you that one ofyou shall betray me and they were exceeding sorrowful and began every one of themto say unto him lord is it i   and he answered and said hethat dippeth his hand with me in the dish the same shall betray me the son of man goeth as it is written of him but woe unto thatman by whom the son of man is betrayed it had been good for that manif he had not been born then judas which betrayed him answered and said master is iti  he said unto him thou hast said and as they were eating jesus took bread and blessed it andbrake it and gave it to the disciples and said take eat this ismy body and he took the cup and gave thanks and gave it to themsaying drink ye all of it  for this is my blood of the newtestament which is shed for many for the remission of sins but i say unto you i will not drink henceforth of this fruit ofthe vine until that day when i drink it new with you in my fatherskingdom and when they had sung an hymn they went out into the mount ofolives then saith jesus unto them all ye shall be offended because ofme this night for it is written i will smite the shepherd and thesheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad but after i am risen again i will go before you into galilee peter answered and said unto him though all men shall beoffended because of thee yet will i never be offended jesus said unto him verily i say unto thee that this nightbefore the cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice peter said unto him though i should die with thee yet will inot deny thee likewise also said all the disciples then cometh jesus with them unto a place called gethsemane andsaith unto the disciples sit ye here while i go and pray yonder and he took with him peter and the two sons of zebedee andbegan to be sorrowful and very heavy then saith he unto them my soul is exceeding sorrowful evenunto death tarry ye here and watch with me and he went a little farther and fell on his face and prayedsaying o my father if it be possible let this cup pass from menevertheless not as i will but as thou wilt and he cometh unto the disciples and findeth them asleep andsaith unto peter what could ye not watch with me one hour  watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation the spirit indeedis willing but the flesh is weak he went away again the second time and prayed saying o myfather if this cup may not pass away from me except i drink it thywill be done and he came and found them asleep again for their eyes wereheavy and he left them and went away again and prayed the thirdtime saying the same words then cometh he to his disciples and saith unto them sleep onnow and take your rest behold the hour is at hand and the son ofman is betrayed into the hands of sinners rise let us be going behold he is at hand that doth betrayme and while he yet spake lo judas one of the twelve came andwith him a great multitude with swords and staves from the chiefpriests and elders of the people now he that betrayed him gave them a sign saying whomsoever ishall kiss that same is he hold him fast and forthwith he came to jesus and said hail master andkissed him and jesus said unto him friend wherefore art thou come thencame they and laid hands on jesus and took him and behold one of them which were with jesus stretched out hishand and drew his sword and struck a servant of the high priestsand smote off his ear then said jesus unto him put up again thy sword into his placefor all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword thinkest thou that i cannot now pray to my father and he shallpresently give me more than twelve legions of angels   but howthen shall the scriptures be fulfilled that thus it must be  in that same hour said jesus to the multitudes are ye come out asagainst a thief with swords and staves for to take me i sat dailywith you teaching in the temple and ye laid no hold on me but all this was done that the scriptures of the prophets mightbe fulfilled then all the disciples forsook him and fled and they that had laid hold on jesus led him away to caiaphasthe high priest where the scribes and the elders were assembled but peter followed him afar off unto the high priests palaceand went in and sat with the servants to see the end now the chief priests and elders and all the council soughtfalse witness against jesus to put him to death  but foundnone yea though many false witnesses came yet found they none atthe last came two false witnesses  and said this fellow said iam able to destroy the temple of god and to build it in three days and the high priest arose and said unto him answerest thounothing what is it which these witness against thee   but jesusheld his peace and the high priest answered and said unto him iadjure thee by the living god that thou tell us whether thou be thechrist the son of god jesus saith unto him thou hast said nevertheless i say untoyou hereafter shall ye see the son of man sitting on the right handof power and coming in the clouds of heaven then the high priest rent his clothes saying he hath spokenblasphemy what further need have we of witnesses behold now ye haveheard his blasphemy what think ye they answered and said he is guilty of death then did they spit in his face and buffeted him and otherssmote him with the palms of their hands  saying prophesy untous thou christ who is he that smote thee   now peter satwithout in the palace and a damsel came unto him saying thou alsowast with jesus of galilee but he denied before them all saying i know not what thousayest and when he was gone out into the porch another maid saw himand said unto them that were there this fellow was also with jesus ofnazareth and again he denied with an oath i do not know the man and after a while came unto him they that stood by and said topeter surely thou also art one of them for thy speech bewrayeththee then began he to curse and to swear saying i know not the manand immediately the cock crew and peter remembered the word of jesus which said unto himbefore the cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice and he went out andwept bitterly when the morning was come all the chief priests and elders ofthe people took counsel against jesus to put him to death  andwhen they had bound him they led him away and delivered him topontius pilate the governor then judas which had betrayed him when he saw that he wascondemned repented himself and brought again the thirty pieces ofsilver to the chief priests and elders  saying i have sinned inthat i have betrayed the innocent blood and they said what is thatto us see thou to that and he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple anddeparted and went and hanged himself and the chief priests took the silver pieces and said it is notlawful for to put them into the treasury because it is the price ofblood and they took counsel and bought with them the potters fieldto bury strangers in wherefore that field was called the field of blood unto thisday then was fulfilled that which was spoken by jeremy the prophetsaying and they took the thirty pieces of silver the price of himthat was valued whom they of the children of israel did value and gave them for the potters field as the lord appointed me and jesus stood before the governor and the governor asked himsaying art thou the king of the jews and jesus said unto him thousayest and when he was accused of the chief priests and elders heanswered nothing then said pilate unto him hearest thou not how many things theywitness against thee   and he answered him to never a wordinsomuch that the governor marvelled greatly now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto thepeople a prisoner whom they would and they had then a notable prisoner called barabbas therefore when they were gathered together pilate said untothem whom will ye that i release unto you barabbas or jesus whichis called christ   for he knew that for envy they had deliveredhim when he was set down on the judgment seat his wife sent untohim saying have thou nothing to do with that just man for i havesuffered many things this day in a dream because of him but the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude thatthey should ask barabbas and destroy jesus the governor answered and said unto them whether of the twainwill ye that i release unto you they said barabbas pilate saith unto them what shall i do then with jesus which iscalled christ they all say unto him let him be crucified and the governor said why what evil hath he done but theycried out the more saying let him be crucified when pilate saw that he could prevail nothing but that rather atumult was made he took water and washed his hands before themultitude saying i am innocent of the blood of this just person seeye to it then answered all the people and said his blood be on us andon our children then released he barabbas unto them and when he had scourgedjesus he delivered him to be crucified then the soldiers of the governor took jesus into the commonhall and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers and they stripped him and put on him a scarlet robe and when they had platted a crown of thorns they put it uponhis head and a reed in his right hand and they bowed the knee beforehim and mocked him saying hail king of the jews   and theyspit upon him and took the reed and smote him on the head and after that they had mocked him they took the robe off fromhim and put his own raiment on him and led him away to crucify him and as they came out they found a man of cyrene simon by namehim they compelled to bear his cross and when they were come unto a place called golgotha that is tosay a place of a skull  they gave him vinegar to drink mingledwith gall and when he had tasted thereof he would not drink and they crucified him and parted his garments casting lotsthat it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet theyparted my garments among them and upon my vesture did they cast lots and sitting down they watched him there  and set up overhis head his accusation written this is jesus the king of the jews then were there two thieves crucified with him one on the righthand and another on the left and they that passed by reviled him wagging their heads and saying thou that destroyest the temple and buildest it in threedays save thyself if thou be the son of god come down from thecross likewise also the chief priests mocking him with the scribesand elders said  he saved others himself he cannot save if hebe the king of israel let him now come down from the cross and wewill believe him he trusted in god let him deliver him now if he will have himfor he said i am the son of god the thieves also which were crucified with him cast the samein his teeth now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the landunto the ninth hour and about the ninth hour jesus cried with a loud voice sayingeli eli lama sabachthani that is to say my god my god why hastthou forsaken me   some of them that stood there when theyheard that said this man calleth for elias and straightway one of them ran and took a spunge and filledit with vinegar and put it on a reed and gave him to drink the rest said let be let us see whether elias will come tosave him jesus when he had cried again with a loud voice yielded up theghost and behold the veil of the temple was rent in twain from thetop to the bottom and the earth did quake and the rocks rent and the graves were opened and many bodies of the saints which sleptarose  and came out of the graves after his resurrection andwent into the holy city and appeared unto many now when the centurion and they that were with him watchingjesus saw the earthquake and those things that were done theyfeared greatly saying truly this was the son of god and many women were there beholding afar off which followedjesus from galilee ministering unto him  among which was marymagdalene and mary the mother of james and joses and the mother ofzebedees children when the even was come there came a rich man of arimathaeanamed joseph who also himself was jesus disciple  he went topilate and begged the body of jesus then pilate commanded the bodyto be delivered and when joseph had taken the body he wrapped it in a cleanlinen cloth  and laid it in his own new tomb which he had hewnout in the rock and he rolled a great stone to the door of thesepulchre and departed and there was mary magdalene and the other mary sitting overagainst the sepulchre now the next day that followed the day of the preparation thechief priests and pharisees came together unto pilate  sayingsir we remember that that deceiver said while he was yet aliveafter three days i will rise again command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until thethird day lest his disciples come by night and steal him away andsay unto the people he is risen from the dead so the last errorshall be worse than the first pilate said unto them ye have a watch go your way make it assure as ye can so they went and made the sepulchre sure sealing the stoneand setting a watch in the end of the sabbath as it began to dawn toward the firstday of the week came mary magdalene and the other mary to see thesepulchre and behold there was a great earthquake for the angel of thelord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone fromthe door and sat upon it his countenance was like lightning and his raiment white assnow  and for fear of him the keepers did shake and became asdead men and the angel answered and said unto the women fear not ye fori know that ye seek jesus which was crucified he is not here for he is risen as he said come see the placewhere the lord lay and go quickly and tell his disciples that he is risen from thedead and behold he goeth before you into galilee there shall yesee him lo i have told you and they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and greatjoy and did run to bring his disciples word and as they went to tell his disciples behold jesus met themsaying all hail and they came and held him by the feet andworshipped him then said jesus unto them be not afraid go tell my brethrenthat they go into galilee and there shall they see me now when they were going behold some of the watch came intothe city and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that weredone and when they were assembled with the elders and had takencounsel they gave large money unto the soldiers  saying sayye his disciples came by night and stole him away while we slept and if this come to the governors ears we will persuade himand secure you so they took the money and did as they were taught and thissaying is commonly reported among the jews until this day then the eleven disciples went away into galilee into amountain where jesus had appointed them and when they saw him they worshipped him but some doubted and jesus came and spake unto them saying all power is givenunto me in heaven and in earth go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in thename of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i have commanded youand lo i am with you alway even unto the end of the world amenthe gospel according to saint mark the beginning of the gospel of jesus christ the son of god as it is written in the prophets behold i send my messenger beforethy face which shall prepare thy way before thee the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way ofthe lord make his paths straight john did baptize in the wilderness and preach the baptism ofrepentance for the remission of sins and there went out unto him all the land of judaea and they ofjerusalem and were all baptized of him in the river of jordanconfessing their sins and john was clothed with camels hair and with a girdle of askin about his loins and he did eat locusts and wild honey  andpreached saying there cometh one mightier than i after me thelatchet of whose shoes i am not worthy to stoop down and unloose i indeed have baptized you with water but he shall baptize youwith the holy ghost and it came to pass in those days that jesus came from nazarethof galilee and was baptized of john in jordan and straightway coming up out of the water he saw the heavensopened and the spirit like a dove descending upon him  and therecame a voice from heaven saying thou art my beloved son in whom iam well pleased and immediately the spirit driveth him into the wilderness and he was there in the wilderness forty days tempted of satanand was with the wild beasts and the angels ministered unto him now after that john was put in prison jesus came into galileepreaching the gospel of the kingdom of god  and saying the timeis fulfilled and the kingdom of god is at hand repent ye andbelieve the gospel now as he walked by the sea of galilee he saw simon and andrewhis brother casting a net into the sea for they were fishers and jesus said unto them come ye after me and i will make youto become fishers of men and straightway they forsook their nets and followed him and when he had gone a little farther thence he saw james theson of zebedee and john his brother who also were in the shipmending their nets and straightway he called them and they left their fatherzebedee in the ship with the hired servants and went after him and they went into capernaum and straightway on the sabbath dayhe entered into the synagogue and taught and they were astonished at his doctrine for he taught them asone that had authority and not as the scribes and there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spiritand he cried out  saying let us alone what have we to do withthee thou jesus of nazareth art thou come to destroy us i know theewho thou art the holy one of god and jesus rebuked him saying hold thy peace and come out ofhim and when the unclean spirit had torn him and cried with a loudvoice he came out of him and they were all amazed insomuch that they questioned amongthemselves saying what thing is this what new doctrine is this forwith authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits and they doobey him and immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the regionround about galilee and forthwith when they were come out of the synagogue theyentered into the house of simon and andrew with james and john but simons wifes mother lay sick of a fever and anon they tellhim of her and he came and took her by the hand and lifted her up andimmediately the fever left her and she ministered unto them and at even when the sun did set they brought unto him all thatwere diseased and them that were possessed with devils and all the city was gathered together at the door and he healed many that were sick of divers diseases and castout many devils and suffered not the devils to speak because theyknew him and in the morning rising up a great while before day he wentout and departed into a solitary place and there prayed and simon and they that were with him followed after him and when they had found him they said unto him all men seek forthee and he said unto them let us go into the next towns that i maypreach there also for therefore came i forth and he preached in their synagogues throughout all galilee andcast out devils and there came a leper to him beseeching him and kneeling downto him and saying unto him if thou wilt thou canst make me clean and jesus moved with compassion put forth his hand and touchedhim and saith unto him i will be thou clean and as soon as he had spoken immediately the leprosy departedfrom him and he was cleansed and he straitly charged him and forthwith sent him away and saith unto him see thou say nothing to any man but go thy wayshew thyself to the priest and offer for thy cleansing those thingswhich moses commanded for a testimony unto them but he went out and began to publish it much and to blazeabroad the matter insomuch that jesus could no more openly enter intothe city but was without in desert places and they came to him fromevery quarter and again he entered into capernaum after some days and it wasnoised that he was in the house and straightway many were gathered together insomuch that therewas no room to receive them no not so much as about the door and hepreached the word unto them and they come unto him bringing one sick of the palsy which wasborne of four and when they could not come nigh unto him for the press theyuncovered the roof where he was and when they had broken it up theylet down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay when jesus saw their faith he said unto the sick of the palsyson thy sins be forgiven thee but there was certain of the scribes sitting there and reasoningin their hearts  why doth this man thus speak blasphemies who canforgive sins but god only   and immediately when jesus perceivedin his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves he said untothem why reason ye these things in your hearts   whether is iteasier to say to the sick of the palsy thy sins be forgiven thee orto say arise and take up thy bed and walk   but that ye mayknow that the son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins hesaith to the sick of the palsy  i say unto thee arise and takeup thy bed and go thy way into thine house and immediately he arose took up the bed and went forth beforethem all insomuch that they were all amazed and glorified godsaying we never saw it on this fashion and he went forth again by the sea side and all the multituderesorted unto him and he taught them and as he passed by he saw levi the son of alphaeus sitting atthe receipt of custom and said unto him follow me and he arose andfollowed him and it came to pass that as jesus sat at meat in his housemany publicans and sinners sat also together with jesus and hisdisciples for there were many and they followed him and when the scribes and pharisees saw him eat with publicans andsinners they said unto his disciples how is it that he eateth anddrinketh with publicans and sinners   when jesus heard it hesaith unto them they that are whole have no need of the physicianbut they that are sick i came not to call the righteous but sinnersto repentance and the disciples of john and of the pharisees used to fast andthey come and say unto him why do the disciples of john and of thepharisees fast but thy disciples fast not   and jesus said untothem can the children of the bridechamber fast while the bridegroomis with them as long as they have the bridegroom with them theycannot fast but the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken awayfrom them and then shall they fast in those days no man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment elsethe new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old and the rentis made worse and no man putteth new wine into old bottles else the new winedoth burst the bottles and the wine is spilled and the bottles willbe marred but new wine must be put into new bottles and it came to pass that he went through the corn fields on thesabbath day and his disciples began as they went to pluck the earsof corn and the pharisees said unto him behold why do they on thesabbath day that which is not lawful   and he said unto themhave ye never read what david did when he had need and was anhungred he and they that were with him   how he went into thehouse of god in the days of abiathar the high priest and did eat theshewbread which is not lawful to eat but for the priests and gavealso to them which were with him   and he said unto them thesabbath was made for man and not man for the sabbath  thereforethe son of man is lord also of the sabbath and he entered again into the synagogue and there was a man therewhich had a withered hand and they watched him whether he would heal him on the sabbathday that they might accuse him and he saith unto the man which had the withered hand standforth and he saith unto them is it lawful to do good on the sabbathdays or to do evil to save life or to kill but they held theirpeace and when he had looked round about on them with anger beinggrieved for the hardness of their hearts he saith unto the manstretch forth thine hand and he stretched it out and his hand wasrestored whole as the other and the pharisees went forth and straightway took counsel withthe herodians against him how they might destroy him but jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea and agreat multitude from galilee followed him and from judaea  andfrom jerusalem and from idumaea and from beyond jordan and theyabout tyre and sidon a great multitude when they had heard whatgreat things he did came unto him and he spake to his disciples that a small ship should wait onhim because of the multitude lest they should throng him for he had healed many insomuch that they pressed upon him forto touch him as many as had plagues and unclean spirits when they saw him fell down before him andcried saying thou art the son of god and he straitly charged them that they should not make him known and he goeth up into a mountain and calleth unto him whom hewould and they came unto him and he ordained twelve that they should be with him and that hemight send them forth to preach  and to have power to healsicknesses and to cast out devils  and simon he surnamed peter and james the son of zebedee and john the brother of james andhe surnamed them boanerges which is the sons of thunder  andandrew and philip and bartholomew and matthew and thomas andjames the son of alphaeus and thaddaeus and simon the canaanite and judas iscariot which also betrayed him and they went intoan house and the multitude cometh together again so that they could notso much as eat bread and when his friends heard of it they went out to lay hold onhim for they said he is beside himself and the scribes which came down from jerusalem said he hathbeelzebub and by the prince of the devils casteth he out devils and he called them unto him and said unto them in parables howcan satan cast out satan   and if a kingdom be divided againstitself that kingdom cannot stand and if a house be divided against itself that house cannotstand and if satan rise up against himself and be divided he cannotstand but hath an end no man can enter into a strong mans house and spoil his goodsexcept he will first bind the strong man and then he will spoil hishouse verily i say unto you all sins shall be forgiven unto the sonsof men and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme but he that shall blaspheme against the holy ghost hath neverforgiveness but is in danger of eternal damnation because they said he hath an unclean spirit there came then his brethren and his mother and standingwithout sent unto him calling him and the multitude sat about him and they said unto him beholdthy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee and he answered them saying who is my mother or my brethren and he looked round about on them which sat about him and saidbehold my mother and my brethren   for whosoever shall do thewill of god the same is my brother and my sister and mother and he began again to teach by the sea side and there wasgathered unto him a great multitude so that he entered into a shipand sat in the sea and the whole multitude was by the sea on theland and he taught them many things by parables and said unto them inhis doctrine  hearken behold there went out a sower to sow and it came to pass as he sowed some fell by the way side and thefowls of the air came and devoured it up and some fell on stony ground where it had not much earth andimmediately it sprang up because it had no depth of earth  butwhen the sun was up it was scorched and because it had no root itwithered away and some fell among thorns and the thorns grew up and choked itand it yielded no fruit and other fell on good ground and did yield fruit that sprang upand increased and brought forth some thirty and some sixty andsome an hundred and he said unto them he that hath ears to hear let him hear and when he was alone they that were about him with the twelveasked of him the parable and he said unto them unto you it is given to know the mysteryof the kingdom of god but unto them that are without all thesethings are done in parables  that seeing they may see and notperceive and hearing they may hear and not understand lest at anytime they should be converted and their sins should be forgiven them and he said unto them know ye not this parable and how thenwill ye know all parables   the sower soweth the word and these are they by the way side where the word is sown butwhen they have heard satan cometh immediately and taketh away theword that was sown in their hearts and these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground whowhen they have heard the word immediately receive it with gladness and have no root in themselves and so endure but for a timeafterward when affliction or persecution ariseth for the words sakeimmediately they are offended and these are they which are sown among thorns such as hear theword  and the cares of this world and the deceitfulness ofriches and the lusts of other things entering in choke the word andit becometh unfruitful and these are they which are sown on good ground such as hearthe word and receive it and bring forth fruit some thirtyfold somesixty and some an hundred and he said unto them is a candle brought to be put under abushel or under a bed and not to be set on a candlestick   forthere is nothing hid which shall not be manifested neither was anything kept secret but that it should come abroad if any man have ears to hear let him hear and he said unto them take heed what ye hear with what measureye mete it shall be measured to you and unto you that hear shallmore be given for he that hath to him shall be given and he that hath notfrom him shall be taken even that which he hath and he said so is the kingdom of god as if a man should castseed into the ground  and should sleep and rise night and dayand the seed should spring and grow up he knoweth not how for the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself first the bladethen the ear after that the full corn in the ear but when the fruit is brought forth immediately he putteth inthe sickle because the harvest is come and he said whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of god or withwhat comparison shall we compare it   it is like a grain ofmustard seed which when it is sown in the earth is less than allthe seeds that be in the earth  but when it is sown it growethup and becometh greater than all herbs and shooteth out greatbranches so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow ofit and with many such parables spake he the word unto them as theywere able to hear it but without a parable spake he not unto them and when they werealone he expounded all things to his disciples and the same day when the even was come he saith unto them letus pass over unto the other side and when they had sent away the multitude they took him even ashe was in the ship and there were also with him other little ships and there arose a great storm of wind and the waves beat intothe ship so that it was now full and he was in the hinder part of the ship asleep on a pillowand they awake him and say unto him master carest thou not that weperish   and he arose and rebuked the wind and said unto thesea peace be still and the wind ceased and there was a great calm and he said unto them why are ye so fearful how is it that yehave no faith   and they feared exceedingly and said one toanother what manner of man is this that even the wind and the seaobey him   and they came over unto the other side of the sea intothe country of the gadarenes and when he was come out of the ship immediately there met himout of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit  who had hisdwelling among the tombs and no man could bind him no not withchains  because that he had been often bound with fetters andchains and the chains had been plucked asunder by him and thefetters broken in pieces neither could any man tame him and always night and day he was in the mountains and in thetombs crying and cutting himself with stones but when he saw jesus afar off he ran and worshipped him  andcried with a loud voice and said what have i to do with thee jesusthou son of the most high god i adjure thee by god that thou tormentme not for he said unto him come out of the man thou unclean spirit and he asked him what is thy name and he answered saying myname is legion for we are many and he besought him much that he would not send them away out ofthe country now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swinefeeding and all the devils besought him saying send us into the swinethat we may enter into them and forthwith jesus gave them leave and the unclean spirits wentout and entered into the swine and the herd ran violently down asteep place into the sea they were about two thousand and werechoked in the sea and they that fed the swine fled and told it in the city and inthe country and they went out to see what it was that was done and they come to jesus and see him that was possessed with thedevil and had the legion sitting and clothed and in his rightmind and they were afraid and they that saw it told them how it befell to him that waspossessed with the devil and also concerning the swine and they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts and when he was come into the ship he that had been possessedwith the devil prayed him that he might be with him howbeit jesus suffered him not but saith unto him go home tothy friends and tell them how great things the lord hath done forthee and hath had compassion on thee and he departed and began to publish in decapolis how greatthings jesus had done for him and all men did marvel and when jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other sidemuch people gathered unto him and he was nigh unto the sea and behold there cometh one of the rulers of the synagoguejairus by name and when he saw him he fell at his feet  andbesought him greatly saying my little daughter lieth at the point ofdeath i pray thee come and lay thy hands on her that she may behealed and she shall live and jesus went with him and much people followed him andthronged him and a certain woman which had an issue of blood twelve years and had suffered many things of many physicians and had spentall that she had and was nothing bettered but rather grew worse when she had heard of jesus came in the press behind andtouched his garment for she said if i may touch but his clothes i shall be whole and straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up and shefelt in her body that she was healed of that plague and jesus immediately knowing in himself that virtue had goneout of him turned him about in the press and said who touched myclothes   and his disciples said unto him thou seest themultitude thronging thee and sayest thou who touched me   andhe looked round about to see her that had done this thing but the woman fearing and trembling knowing what was done inher came and fell down before him and told him all the truth and he said unto her daughter thy faith hath made thee wholego in peace and be whole of thy plague while he yet spake there came from the ruler of the synagogueshouse certain which said thy daughter is dead why troublest thou themaster any further   as soon as jesus heard the word that wasspoken he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue be not afraid onlybelieve and he suffered no man to follow him save peter and james andjohn the brother of james and he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue andseeth the tumult and them that wept and wailed greatly and when he was come in he saith unto them why make ye thisado and weep the damsel is not dead but sleepeth and they laughed him to scorn but when he had put them all outhe taketh the father and the mother of the damsel and them that werewith him and entereth in where the damsel was lying and he took the damsel by the hand and said unto her talithacumi which is being interpreted damsel i say unto thee arise and straightway the damsel arose and walked for she was of theage of twelve years and they were astonished with a greatastonishment and he charged them straitly that no man should know it andcommanded that something should be given her to eat and he went out from thence and came into his own country andhis disciples follow him and when the sabbath day was come he began to teach in thesynagogue and many hearing him were astonished saying from whencehath this man these things and what wisdom is this which is givenunto him that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands  is not this the carpenter the son of mary the brother of james andjoses and of juda and simon and are not his sisters here with usand they were offended at him but jesus said unto them a prophet is not without honour but inhis own country and among his own kin and in his own house and he could there do no mighty work save that he laid his handsupon a few sick folk and healed them and he marvelled because of their unbelief and he went roundabout the villages teaching and he called unto him the twelve and began to send them forth bytwo and two and gave them power over unclean spirits  andcommanded them that they should take nothing for their journey save astaff only no scrip no bread no money in their purse  but beshod with sandals and not put on two coats and he said unto them in what place soever ye enter into anhouse there abide till ye depart from that place and whosoever shall not receive you nor hear you when ye departthence shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony againstthemverily i say unto you it shall be more tolerable for sodom andgomorrha in the day of judgment than for that city and they went out and preached that men should repent and they cast out many devils and anointed with oil many thatwere sick and healed them and king herod heard of him for his name was spread abroadand he said that john the baptist was risen from the dead andtherefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him others said that it is elias and others said that it is aprophet or as one of the prophets but when herod heard thereof he said it is john whom ibeheaded he is risen from the dead for herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon john andbound him in prison for herodias sake his brother philips wife forhe had married her for john had said unto herod it is not lawful for thee to havethy brothers wife therefore herodias had a quarrel against him and would havekilled him but she could not  for herod feared john knowingthat he was a just man and an holy and observed him and when heheard him he did many things and heard him gladly and when a convenient day was come that herod on his birthdaymade a supper to his lords high captains and chief estates ofgalilee  and when the daughter of the said herodias came in anddanced and pleased herod and them that sat with him the king saidunto the damsel ask of me whatsoever thou wilt and i will give itthee and he sware unto her whatsoever thou shalt ask of me i willgive it thee unto the half of my kingdom and she went forth and said unto her mother what shall i askand she said the head of john the baptist and she came in straightway with haste unto the king and askedsaying i will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head ofjohn the baptist and the king was exceeding sorry yet for his oaths sake andfor their sakes which sat with him he would not reject her and immediately the king sent an executioner and commanded hishead to be brought and he went and beheaded him in the prison and brought his head in a charger and gave it to the damsel and thedamsel gave it to her mother and when his disciples heard of it they came and took up hiscorpse and laid it in a tomb and the apostles gathered themselves together unto jesus andtold him all things both what they had done and what they hadtaught and he said unto them come ye yourselves apart into a desertplace and rest a while for there were many coming and going andthey had no leisure so much as to eat and they departed into a desert place by ship privately and the people saw them departing and many knew him and ranafoot thither out of all cities and outwent them and came togetherunto him and jesus when he came out saw much people and was moved withcompassion toward them because they were as sheep not having ashepherd and he began to teach them many things and when the day was now far spent his disciples came unto himand said this is a desert place and now the time is far passed send them away that they may go into the country round about andinto the villages and buy themselves bread for they have nothing toeat he answered and said unto them give ye them to eat and they sayunto him shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread andgive them to eat   he saith unto them how many loaves have yego and see and when they knew they say five and two fishes and he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon thegreen grass and they sat down in ranks by hundreds and by fifties and when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes helooked up to heaven and blessed and brake the loaves and gave themto his disciples to set before them and the two fishes divided heamong them all and they did all eat and were filled and they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments and of thefishes and they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men and straightway he constrained his disciples to get into theship and to go to the other side before unto bethsaida while he sentaway the people and when he had sent them away he departed into a mountain topray and when even was come the ship was in the midst of the sea andhe alone on the land and he saw them toiling in rowing for the wind was contrary untothem and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto themwalking upon the sea and would have passed by them but when they saw him walking upon the sea they supposed it hadbeen a spirit and cried out  for they all saw him and weretroubled and immediately he talked with them and saith unto them beof good cheer it is i be not afraid and he went up unto them into the ship and the wind ceased andthey were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure and wondered for they considered not the miracle of the loaves for theirheart was hardened and when they had passed over they came into the land ofgennesaret and drew to the shore and when they were come out of the ship straightway they knewhim  and ran through that whole region round about and began tocarry about in beds those that were sick where they heard he was and whithersoever he entered into villages or cities orcountry they laid the sick in the streets and besought him that theymight touch if it were but the border of his garment and as many astouched him were made whole then came together unto him the pharisees and certain of thescribes which came from jerusalem and when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiledthat is to say with unwashen hands they found fault for the pharisees and all the jews except they wash their handsoft eat not holding the tradition of the elders and when they come from the market except they wash they eatnotand many other things there be which they have received to hold asthe washing of cups and pots brasen vessels and of tables then the pharisees and scribes asked him why walk not thydisciples according to the tradition of the elders but eat bread withunwashen hands   he answered and said unto them well hath esaiasprophesied of you hypocrites as it is written this people honourethme with their lips but their heart is far from me howbeit in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrines thecommandments of men for laying aside the commandment of god ye hold the tradition ofmen as the washing of pots and cups and many other such like thingsye do and he said unto them full well ye reject the commandment of godthat ye may keep your own tradition for moses said honour thy father and thy mother and whosocurseth father or mother let him die the death  but ye say if aman shall say to his father or mother it is corban that is to say agift by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me he shall be free and ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or hismother  making the word of god of none effect through yourtradition which ye have delivered and many such like things do ye and when he had called all the people unto him he said untothem hearken unto me every one of you and understand  there isnothing from without a man that entering into him can defile him butthe things which come out of him those are they that defile the man if any man have ears to hear let him hear and when he was entered into the house from the people hisdisciples asked him concerning the parable and he saith unto them are ye so without understanding also doye not perceive that whatsoever thing from without entereth into theman it cannot defile him  because it entereth not into hisheart but into the belly and goeth out into the draught purging allmeats   and he said that which cometh out of the man thatdefileth the man for from within out of the heart of men proceed evil thoughtsadulteries fornications murders  thefts covetousnesswickedness deceit lasciviousness an evil eye blasphemy pridefoolishness  all these evil things come from within and defilethe man and from thence he arose and went into the borders of tyre andsidon and entered into an house and would have no man know it buthe could not be hid for a certain woman whose young daughter had an unclean spiritheard of him and came and fell at his feet  the woman was agreek a syrophenician by nation and she besought him that he wouldcast forth the devil out of her daughter but jesus said unto her let the children first be filled for itis not meet to take the childrens bread and to cast it unto thedogs and she answered and said unto him yes lord yet the dogs underthe table eat of the childrens crumbs and he said unto her for this saying go thy way the devil isgone out of thy daughter and when she was come to her house she found the devil gone outand her daughter laid upon the bed and again departing from the coasts of tyre and sidon he cameunto the sea of galilee through the midst of the coasts of decapolis and they bring unto him one that was deaf and had an impedimentin his speech and they beseech him to put his hand upon him and he took him aside from the multitude and put his fingersinto his ears and he spit and touched his tongue  and lookingup to heaven he sighed and saith unto him ephphatha that is beopened and straightway his ears were opened and the string of histongue was loosed and he spake plain and he charged them that they should tell no man but the more hecharged them so much the more a great deal they published it and were beyond measure astonished saying he hath done all thingswell he maketh both the deaf to hear and the dumb to speak in those days the multitude being very great and having nothingto eat jesus called his disciples unto him and saith unto them i have compassion on the multitude because they have now been with methree days and have nothing to eat  and if i send them awayfasting to their own houses they will faint by the way for divers ofthem came from far and his disciples answered him from whence can a man satisfythese men with bread here in the wilderness   and he asked themhow many loaves have ye and they said seven and he commanded the people to sit down on the ground and he tookthe seven loaves and gave thanks and brake and gave to hisdisciples to set before them and they did set them before the people and they had a few small fishes and he blessed and commanded toset them also before them so they did eat and were filled and they took up of the brokenmeat that was left seven baskets and they that had eaten were about four thousand and he sent themaway and straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples andcame into the parts of dalmanutha and the pharisees came forth and began to question with himseeking of him a sign from heaven tempting him and he sighed deeply in his spirit and saith why doth thisgeneration seek after a sign verily i say unto you there shall nosign be given unto this generation and he left them and entering into the ship again departed tothe other side now the disciples had forgotten to take bread neither had theyin the ship with them more than one loaf and he charged them saying take heed beware of the leaven ofthe pharisees and of the leaven of herod and they reasoned among themselves saying it is because we haveno bread and when jesus knew it he saith unto them why reason yebecause ye have no bread perceive ye not yet neither understandhave ye your heart yet hardened   having eyes see ye not andhaving ears hear ye not and do ye not remember   when i brakethe five loaves among five thousand how many baskets full offragments took ye up they say unto him twelve and when the seven among four thousand how many baskets full offragments took ye up and they said seven and he said unto them how is it that ye do not understand  and he cometh to bethsaida and they bring a blind man unto him andbesought him to touch him and he took the blind man by the hand and led him out of thetown and when he had spit on his eyes and put his hands upon him heasked him if he saw ought and he looked up and said i see men as trees walking after that he put his hands again upon his eyes and made himlook up and he was restored and saw every man clearly and he sent him away to his house saying neither go into thetown nor tell it to any in the town and jesus went out and his disciples into the towns of caesareaphilippi and by the way he asked his disciples saying unto themwhom do men say that i am   and they answered john the baptistbut some say elias and others one of the prophets and he saith unto them but whom say ye that i am and peteranswereth and saith unto him thou art the christ and he charged them that they should tell no man of him and he began to teach them that the son of man must suffer manythings and be rejected of the elders and of the chief priests andscribes and be killed and after three days rise again and he spake that saying openly and peter took him and began torebuke him but when he had turned about and looked on his disciples herebuked peter saying get thee behind me satan for thou savourestnot the things that be of god but the things that be of men and when he had called the people unto him with his disciplesalso he said unto them whosoever will come after me let him denyhimself and take up his cross and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoevershall lose his life for my sake and the gospels the same shall saveit for what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole worldand lose his own soul   or what shall a man give in exchange forhis soul   whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of mywords in this adulterous and sinful generation of him also shall theson of man be ashamed when he cometh in the glory of his father withthe holy angels and he said unto them verily i say unto you that there be someof them that stand here which shall not taste of death till theyhave seen the kingdom of god come with power and after six days jesus taketh with him peter and james andjohn and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselvesand he was transfigured before them and his raiment became shining exceeding white as snow so as nofuller on earth can white them and there appeared unto them elias with moses and they weretalking with jesus and peter answered and said to jesus master it is good for us tobe here and let us make three tabernacles one for thee and one formoses and one for elias for he wist not what to say for they were sore afraid and there was a cloud that overshadowed them and a voice came outof the cloud saying this is my beloved son hear him and suddenly when they had looked round about they saw no manany more save jesus only with themselves and as they came down from the mountain he charged them that theyshould tell no man what things they had seen till the son of man wererisen from the dead and they kept that saying with themselves questioning one withanother what the rising from the dead should mean and they asked him saying why say the scribes that elias mustfirst come   and he answered and told them elias verily comethfirst and restoreth all things and how it is written of the son ofman that he must suffer many things and be set at nought but i say unto you that elias is indeed come and they have doneunto him whatsoever they listed as it is written of him and when he came to his disciples he saw a great multitude aboutthem and the scribes questioning with them and straightway all the people when they beheld him weregreatly amazed and running to him saluted him and he asked the scribes what question ye with them   andone of the multitude answered and said master i have brought untothee my son which hath a dumb spirit  and wheresoever he takethhim he teareth him and he foameth and gnasheth with his teeth andpineth away and i spake to thy disciples that they should cast himout and they could not he answereth him and saith o faithless generation how longshall i be with you how long shall i suffer you bring him unto me and they brought him unto him and when he saw him straightwaythe spirit tare him and he fell on the ground and wallowed foaming and he asked his father how long is it ago since this came untohim  and he said of a child and ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire and into the watersto destroy him but if thou canst do any thing have compassion on usand help us jesus said unto him if thou canst believe all things arepossible to him that believeth and straightway the father of the child cried out and said withtears lord i believe help thou mine unbelief when jesus saw that the people came running together he rebukedthe foul spirit saying unto him thou dumb and deaf spirit i chargethee come out of him and enter no more into him and the spirit cried and rent him sore and came out of him andhe was as one dead insomuch that many said he is dead but jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up and he arose and when he was come into the house his disciples asked himprivately why could not we cast him out   and he said unto themthis kind can come forth by nothing but by prayer and fasting and they departed thence and passed through galilee and hewould not that any man should know it for he taught his disciples and said unto them the son of manis delivered into the hands of men and they shall kill him and afterthat he is killed he shall rise the third day but they understood not that saying and were afraid to ask him and he came to capernaum and being in the house he asked themwhat was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way   butthey held their peace for by the way they had disputed amongthemselves who should be the greatest and he sat down and called the twelve and saith unto them ifany man desire to be first the same shall be last of all and servantof all and he took a child and set him in the midst of them and whenhe had taken him in his arms he said unto them  whosoever shallreceive one of such children in my name receiveth me and whosoevershall receive me receiveth not me but him that sent me and john answered him saying master we saw one casting outdevils in thy name and he followeth not us and we forbad himbecause he followeth not us but jesus said forbid him not for there is no man which shalldo a miracle in my name that can lightly speak evil of me for he that is not against us is on our part for whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my namebecause ye belong to christ verily i say unto you he shall not losehis reward and whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believein me it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about hisneck and he were cast into the sea and if thy hand offend thee cut it off it is better for thee toenter into life maimed than having two hands to go into hell intothe fire that never shall be quenched  where their worm diethnot and the fire is not quenched and if thy foot offend thee cut it off it is better for thee toenter halt into life than having two feet to be cast into hell intothe fire that never shall be quenched  where their worm diethnot and the fire is not quenched and if thine eye offend thee pluck it out it is better for theeto enter into the kingdom of god with one eye than having two eyes tobe cast into hell fire  where their worm dieth not and the fireis not quenched for every one shall be salted with fire and every sacrificeshall be salted with salt salt is good but if the salt have lost his saltness wherewithwill ye season it have salt in yourselves and have peace one withanother and he arose from thence and cometh into the coasts of judaea bythe farther side of jordan and the people resort unto him again andas he was wont he taught them again and the pharisees came to him and asked him is it lawful for aman to put away his wife tempting him and he answered and said unto them what did moses command you and they said moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement andto put her away and jesus answered and said unto them for the hardness of yourheart he wrote you this precept but from the beginning of the creation god made them male andfemale for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother andcleave to his wife  and they twain shall be one flesh so thenthey are no more twain but one flesh what therefore god hath joined together let not man put asunder and in the house his disciples asked him again of the samematter and he saith unto them whosoever shall put away his wife andmarry another committeth adultery against her and if a woman shall put away her husband and be married toanother she committeth adultery and they brought young children to him that he should touchthem and his disciples rebuked those that brought them but when jesus saw it he was much displeased and said untothem suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them notfor of such is the kingdom of god verily i say unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingdomof god as a little child he shall not enter therein and he took them up in his arms put his hands upon them andblessed them and when he was gone forth into the way there came one runningand kneeled to him and asked him good master what shall i do that imay inherit eternal life   and jesus said unto him why callestthou me good there is none good but one that is god thou knowest the commandments do not commit adultery do notkill do not steal do not bear false witness defraud not honour thyfather and mother   and he answered and said unto him masterall these have i observed from my youth then jesus beholding him loved him and said unto him one thingthou lackest go thy way sell whatsoever thou hast and give to thepoor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come take up thecross and follow me and he was sad at that saying and went away grieved for he hadgreat possessions and jesus looked round about and saith unto his disciples howhardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of god and the disciples were astonished at his words but jesusanswereth again and saith unto them children how hard is it forthem that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of god   itis easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for arich man to enter into the kingdom of god and they were astonished out of measure saying amongthemselves who then can be saved   and jesus looking upon themsaith with men it is impossible but not with god for with god allthings are possible then peter began to say unto him lo we have left all and havefollowed thee and jesus answered and said verily i say unto you there is noman that hath left house or brethren or sisters or father ormother or wife or children or lands for my sake and the gospels but he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time housesand brethren and sisters and mothers and children and lands withpersecutions and in the world to come eternal life but many that are first shall be last and the last first and they were in the way going up to jerusalem and jesus wentbefore them and they were amazed and as they followed they wereafraidand he took again the twelve and began to tell them what thingsshould happen unto him  saying behold we go up to jerusalemand the son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests and untothe scribes and they shall condemn him to death and shall deliverhim to the gentiles  and they shall mock him and shall scourgehim and shall spit upon him and shall kill him and the third day heshall rise again and james and john the sons of zebedee come unto him sayingmaster we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shalldesire and he said unto them what would ye that i should do for you they said unto him grant unto us that we may sit one on thyright hand and the other on thy left hand in thy glory but jesus said unto them ye know not what ye ask can ye drinkof the cup that i drink of and be baptized with the baptism that i ambaptized with   and they said unto him we can and jesus saidunto them ye shall indeed drink of the cup that i drink of and withthe baptism that i am baptized withal shall ye be baptized  butto sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give butit shall be given to them for whom it is prepared and when the ten heard it they began to be much displeased withjames and john but jesus called them to him and saith unto them ye know thatthey which are accounted to rule over the gentiles exercise lordshipover them and their great ones exercise authority upon them but so shall it not be among you but whosoever will be greatamong you shall be your minister  and whosoever of you will bethe chiefest shall be servant of all for even the son of man came not to be ministered unto but tominister and to give his life a ransom for many and they came to jericho and as he went out of jericho with hisdisciples and a great number of people blind bartimaeus the son oftimaeus sat by the highway side begging and when he heard that it was jesus of nazareth he began to cryout and say jesus thou son of david have mercy on me and many charged him that he should hold his peace but he criedthe more a great deal thou son of david have mercy on me and jesus stood still and commanded him to be called and theycall the blind man saying unto him be of good comfort rise hecalleth thee and he casting away his garment rose and came to jesus and jesus answered and said unto him what wilt thou that ishould do unto thee the blind man said unto him lord that i mightreceive my sight and jesus said unto him go thy way thy faith hath made theewholeand immediately he received his sight and followed jesus in the way and when they came nigh to jerusalem unto bethphage and bethanyat the mount of olives he sendeth forth two of his disciples and saith unto them go your way into the village over against youand as soon as ye be entered into it ye shall find a colt tiedwhereon never man sat loose him and bring him and if any man say unto you why do ye this say ye that the lordhath need of him and straightway he will send him hither and they went their way and found the colt tied by the doorwithout in a place where two ways met and they loose him and certain of them that stood there said unto them what do yeloosing the colt   and they said unto them even as jesus hadcommanded and they let them go and they brought the colt to jesus and cast their garments onhim and he sat upon him and many spread their garments in the way and others cut downbranches off the trees and strawed them in the way and they that went before and they that followed cried sayinghosanna blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord blessed be the kingdom of our father david that cometh in the name ofthe lord hosanna in the highest and jesus entered into jerusalem and into the temple and whenhe had looked round about upon all things and now the eventide wascome he went out unto bethany with the twelve and on the morrow when they were come from bethany he washungry  and seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves he cameif haply he might find any thing thereon and when he came to it hefound nothing but leaves for the time of figs was not yet and jesus answered and said unto it no man eat fruit of theehereafter for ever and his disciples heard it and they come to jerusalem and jesus went into the temple andbegan to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple andoverthrew the tables of the moneychangers and the seats of them thatsold doves  and would not suffer that any man should carry anyvessel through the temple and he taught saying unto them is it not written my houseshall be called of all nations the house of prayer but ye have madeit a den of thieves and the scribes and chief priests heard it and sought how theymight destroy him for they feared him because all the people wasastonished at his doctrine and when even was come he went out of the city and in the morning as they passed by they saw the fig treedried up from the roots and peter calling to remembrance saith unto him master beholdthe fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away and jesus answering saith unto them have faith in god for verily i say unto you that whosoever shall say unto thismountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shallnot doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which hesaith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith therefore i say unto you what things soever ye desire when yepray believe that ye receive them and ye shall have them and when ye stand praying forgive if ye have ought againstany that your father also which is in heaven may forgive you yourtrespasses but if ye do not forgive neither will your father which is inheaven forgive your trespasses and they come again to jerusalem and as he was walking in thetemple there come to him the chief priests and the scribes and theelders  and say unto him by what authority doest thou thesethings and who gave thee this authority to do these things  and jesus answered and said unto them i will also ask of you onequestion and answer me and i will tell you by what authority i dothese things the baptism of john was it from heaven or of men answer me and they reasoned with themselves saying if we shall say fromheaven he will say why then did ye not believe him   but if weshall say of men they feared the people for all men counted johnthat he was a prophet indeed and they answered and said unto jesus we cannot tell and jesusanswering saith unto them neither do i tell you by what authority ido these things and he began to speak unto them by parables a certain manplanted a vineyard and set an hedge about it and digged a place forthe winefat and built a tower and let it out to husbandmen and wentinto a far country and at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant that hemight receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard and they caught him and beat him and sent him away empty and again he sent unto them another servant and at him they caststones and wounded him in the head and sent him away shamefullyhandled and again he sent another and him they killed and many othersbeating some and killing some having yet therefore one son his wellbeloved he sent him alsolast unto them saying they will reverence my son but those husbandmen said among themselves this is the heircome let us kill him and the inheritance shall be ours and they took him and killed him and cast him out of thevineyard what shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do he will comeand destroy the husbandmen and will give the vineyard unto others and have ye not read this scripture the stone which thebuilders rejected is become the head of the corner  this was thelords doing and it is marvellous in our eyes   and they soughtto lay hold on him but feared the people for they knew that he hadspoken the parable against them and they left him and went theirway and they send unto him certain of the pharisees and of theherodians to catch him in his words and when they were come they say unto him master we know thatthou art true and carest for no man for thou regardest not theperson of men but teachest the way of god in truth is it lawful togive tribute to caesar or not   shall we give or shall we notgive but he knowing their hypocrisy said unto them why tempt yeme bring me a penny that i may see it and they brought it and he saith unto them whose is this imageand superscription and they said unto him caesars and jesus answering said unto them render to caesar the thingsthat are caesars and to god the things that are gods and theymarvelled at him then come unto him the sadducees which say there is noresurrection and they asked him saying  master moses wroteunto us if a mans brother die and leave his wife behind him andleave no children that his brother should take his wife and raise upseed unto his brother now there were seven brethren and the first took a wife anddying left no seed and the second took her and died neither left he any seed andthe third likewise and the seven had her and left no seed last of all the womandied also in the resurrection therefore when they shall rise whose wifeshall she be of them for the seven had her to wife and jesus answering said unto them do ye not therefore errbecause ye know not the scriptures neither the power of god  for when they shall rise from the dead they neither marry nor aregiven in marriage but are as the angels which are in heaven and as touching the dead that they rise have ye not read inthe book of moses how in the bush god spake unto him saying i amthe god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob  he is not the god of the dead but the god of the living ye thereforedo greatly err and one of the scribes came and having heard them reasoningtogether and perceiving that he had answered them well asked himwhich is the first commandment of all   and jesus answered himthe first of all the commandments is hear o israel the lord our godis one lord  and thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thyheart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind and with all thystrength this is the first commandment and the second is like namely this thou shalt love thyneighbour as thyself there is none other commandment greater thanthese and the scribe said unto him well master thou hast said thetruth for there is one god and there is none other but he  andto love him with all the heart and with all the understanding andwith all the soul and with all the strength and to love hisneighbour as himself is more than all whole burnt offerings andsacrifices and when jesus saw that he answered discreetly he said untohim thou art not far from the kingdom of god and no man after thatdurst ask him any question and jesus answered and said while he taught in the temple howsay the scribes that christ is the son of david   for davidhimself said by the holy ghost the lord said to my lord sit thou onmy right hand till i make thine enemies thy footstool david therefore himself calleth him lord and whence is he thenhis son and the common people heard him gladly and he said unto them in his doctrine beware of the scribeswhich love to go in long clothing and love salutations in themarketplaces  and the chief seats in the synagogues and theuppermost rooms at feasts  which devour widows houses and fora pretence make long prayers these shall receive greater damnation and jesus sat over against the treasury and beheld how thepeople cast money into the treasury and many that were rich cast inmuch and there came a certain poor widow and she threw in two miteswhich make a farthing and he called unto him his disciples and saith unto themverily i say unto you that this poor widow hath cast more in thanall they which have cast into the treasury  for all they didcast in of their abundance but she of her want did cast in all thatshe had even all her living and as he went out of the temple one of his disciples saith untohim master see what manner of stones and what buildings are here and jesus answering said unto him seest thou these greatbuildings  there shall not be left one stone upon another that shallnot be thrown down and as he sat upon the mount of olives over against the templepeter and james and john and andrew asked him privately  tell uswhen shall these things be and what shall be the sign when all thesethings shall be fulfilled   and jesus answering them began tosay take heed lest any man deceive you  for many shall come inmy name saying i am christ and shall deceive many and when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars be ye nottroubled for such things must needs be but the end shall not be yet for nation shall rise against nation and kingdom againstkingdom and there shall be earthquakes in divers places and thereshall be famines and troubles these are the beginnings of sorrows but take heed to yourselves for they shall deliver you up tocouncils and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten and ye shall bebrought before rulers and kings for my sake for a testimony againstthem and the gospel must first be published among all nations but when they shall lead you and deliver you up take nothought beforehand what ye shall speak neither do ye premeditate butwhatsoever shall be given you in that hour that speak ye for it isnot ye that speak but the holy ghost now the brother shall betray the brother to death and thefather the son and children shall rise up against their parents andshall cause them to be put to death and ye shall be hated of all men for my names sake but he thatshall endure unto the end the same shall be saved but when ye shall see the abomination of desolation spoken ofby daniel the prophet standing where it ought not let him thatreadeth understand then let them that be in judaea flee to themountains  and let him that is on the housetop not go down intothe house neither enter therein to take any thing out of his house and let him that is in the field not turn back again for to takeup his garment but woe to them that are with child and to them that give suckin those days   and pray ye that your flight be not in thewinter for in those days shall be affliction such as was not from thebeginning of the creation which god created unto this time neithershall be and except that the lord had shortened those days no fleshshould be saved but for the elects sake whom he hath chosen hehath shortened the days and then if any man shall say to you lo here is christ orlo he is there believe him not  for false christs and falseprophets shall rise and shall shew signs and wonders to seduce ifit were possible even the elect but take ye heed behold i have foretold you all things but in those days after that tribulation the sun shall bedarkened and the moon shall not give her light  and the starsof heaven shall fall and the powers that are in heaven shall beshaken and then shall they see the son of man coming in the clouds withgreat power and glory and then shall he send his angels and shall gather together hiselect from the four winds from the uttermost part of the earth to theuttermost part of heaven now learn a parable of the fig tree when her branch is yettender and putteth forth leaves ye know that summer is near so ye in like manner when ye shall see these things come to passknow that it is nigh even at the doors verily i say unto you that this generation shall not pass tillall these things be done heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not passaway but of that day and that hour knoweth no man no not the angelswhich are in heaven neither the son but the father take ye heed watch and pray for ye know not when the time is for the son of man is as a man taking a far journey who lefthis house and gave authority to his servants and to every man hiswork and commanded the porter to watch watch ye therefore for ye know not when the master of the housecometh at even or at midnight or at the cockcrowing or in themorning  lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping and what i say unto you i say unto all watch after two days was the feast of the passover and of unleavenedbread and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they mighttake him by craft and put him to death but they said not on the feast day lest there be an uproar ofthe people and being in bethany in the house of simon the leper as he satat meat there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment ofspikenard very precious and she brake the box and poured it on hishead and there were some that had indignation within themselves andsaid why was this waste of the ointment made   for it might havebeen sold for more than three hundred pence and have been given tothe poor and they murmured against her and jesus said let her alone why trouble ye her she hathwrought a good work on me for ye have the poor with you always and whensoever ye will yemay do them good but me ye have not always she hath done what she could she is come aforehand to anoint mybody to the burying verily i say unto you wheresoever this gospel shall be preachedthroughout the whole world this also that she hath done shall bespoken of for a memorial of her and judas iscariot one of the twelve went unto the chiefpriests to betray him unto them and when they heard it they were glad and promised to give himmoney and he sought how he might conveniently betray him and the first day of unleavened bread when they killed thepassover his disciples said unto him where wilt thou that we go andprepare that thou mayest eat the passover   and he sendeth forthtwo of his disciples and saith unto them go ye into the city andthere shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water follow him and wheresoever he shall go in say ye to the goodman of thehouse the master saith where is the guestchamber where i shall eatthe passover with my disciples   and he will shew you a largeupper room furnished and prepared there make ready for us and his disciples went forth and came into the city and foundas he had said unto them and they made ready the passover and in the evening he cometh with the twelve and as they sat and did eat jesus said verily i say unto youone of you which eateth with me shall betray me and they began to be sorrowful and to say unto him one by oneis it i and another said is it i   and he answered and saidunto them it is one of the twelve that dippeth with me in the dish the son of man indeed goeth as it is written of him but woe tothat man by whom the son of man is betrayed good were it for that manif he had never been born and as they did eat jesus took bread and blessed and brakeit and gave to them and said take eat this is my body and he took the cup and when he had given thanks he gave it tothem and they all drank of it and he said unto them this is my blood of the new testamentwhich is shed for many verily i say unto you i will drink no more of the fruit of thevine until that day that i drink it new in the kingdom of god and when they had sung an hymn they went out into the mount ofolives and jesus saith unto them all ye shall be offended because ofme this night for it is written i will smite the shepherd and thesheep shall be scattered but after that i am risen i will go before you into galilee but peter said unto him although all shall be offended yetwill not i and jesus saith unto him verily i say unto thee that this dayeven in this night before the cock crow twice thou shalt deny methrice but he spake the more vehemently if i should die with thee iwill not deny thee in any wise likewise also said they all and they came to a place which was named gethsemane and hesaith to his disciples sit ye here while i shall pray and he taketh with him peter and james and john and began to besore amazed and to be very heavy  and saith unto them my soulis exceeding sorrowful unto death tarry ye here and watch and he went forward a little and fell on the ground and prayedthat if it were possible the hour might pass from him and he said abba father all things are possible unto theetake away this cup from me nevertheless not what i will but whatthou wilt and he cometh and findeth them sleeping and saith unto petersimon sleepest thou couldest not thou watch one hour   watchye and pray lest ye enter into temptation the spirit truly is readybut the flesh is weak and again he went away and prayed and spake the same words and when he returned he found them asleep again for theireyes were heavy neither wist they what to answer him and he cometh the third time and saith unto them sleep on nowand take your rest it is enough the hour is come behold the son ofman is betrayed into the hands of sinners rise up let us go lo he that betrayeth me is at hand and immediately while he yet spake cometh judas one of thetwelve and with him a great multitude with swords and staves fromthe chief priests and the scribes and the elders and he that betrayed him had given them a token sayingwhomsoever i shall kiss that same is he take him and lead him awaysafely and as soon as he was come he goeth straightway to him andsaith master master and kissed him and they laid their hands on him and took him and one of them that stood by drew a sword and smote a servantof the high priest and cut off his ear and jesus answered and said unto them are ye come out asagainst a thief with swords and with staves to take me   i wasdaily with you in the temple teaching and ye took me not but thescriptures must be fulfilled and they all forsook him and fled and there followed him a certain young man having a linen clothcast about his naked body and the young men laid hold on him and he left the linen cloth and fled from them naked and they led jesus away to the high priest and with him wereassembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes and peter followed him afar off even into the palace of thehigh priest and he sat with the servants and warmed himself at thefire and the chief priests and all the council sought for witnessagainst jesus to put him to death and found none for many bare false witness against him but their witnessagreed not together and there arose certain and bare false witness against himsaying  we heard him say i will destroy this temple that ismade with hands and within three days i will build another madewithout hands but neither so did their witness agree together and the high priest stood up in the midst and asked jesussaying answerest thou nothing what is it which these witness againstthee   but he held his peace and answered nothing again thehigh priest asked him and said unto him art thou the christ the sonof the blessed   and jesus said i am and ye shall see the sonof man sitting on the right hand of power and coming in the clouds ofheaven then the high priest rent his clothes and saith what need weany further witnesses   ye have heard the blasphemy what thinkye and they all condemned him to be guilty of death and some began to spit on him and to cover his face and tobuffet him and to say unto him prophesy and the servants did strikehim with the palms of their hands and as peter was beneath in the palace there cometh one of themaids of the high priest  and when she saw peter warminghimself she looked upon him and said and thou also wast with jesusof nazareth but he denied saying i know not neither understand i whatthou sayest and he went out into the porch and the cock crew and a maid saw him again and began to say to them that stoodby this is one of them and he denied it again and a little after they that stood bysaid again to peter surely thou art one of them for thou art agalilaean and thy speech agreeth thereto but he began to curse and to swear saying i know not this manof whom ye speak and the second time the cock crew and peter called to mind theword that jesus said unto him before the cock crow twice thou shaltdeny me thrice and when he thought thereon he wept and straightway in the morning the chief priests held aconsultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council andbound jesus and carried him away and delivered him to pilate and pilate asked him art thou the king of the jews and heanswering said unto them thou sayest it and the chief priests accused him of many things but he answerednothing and pilate asked him again saying answerest thou nothingbehold how many things they witness against thee but jesus yet answered nothing so that pilate marvelled now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner whomsoeverthey desired and there was one named barabbas which lay bound with them thathad made insurrection with him who had committed murder in theinsurrection and the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as hehad ever done unto them but pilate answered them saying will ye that i release unto youthe king of the jews   for he knew that the chief priests haddelivered him for envy but the chief priests moved the people that he should ratherrelease barabbas unto them and pilate answered and said again unto them what will ye thenthat i shall do unto him whom ye call the king of the jews   andthey cried out again crucify him then pilate said unto them why what evil hath he done andthey cried out the more exceedingly crucify him and so pilate willing to content the people released barabbasunto them and delivered jesus when he had scourged him to becrucified and the soldiers led him away into the hall called praetoriumand they call together the whole band and they clothed him with purple and platted a crown of thornsand put it about his head  and began to salute him hail kingof the jews   and they smote him on the head with a reed anddid spit upon him and bowing their knees worshipped him and when they had mocked him they took off the purple from himand put his own clothes on him and led him out to crucify him and they compel one simon a cyrenian who passed by coming outof the country the father of alexander and rufus to bear his cross and they bring him unto the place golgotha which is beinginterpreted the place of a skull and they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh but hereceived it not and when they had crucified him they parted his garmentscasting lots upon them what every man should take and it was the third hour and they crucified him and the superscription of his accusation was written over theking of the jews and with him they crucify two thieves the one on his righthand and the other on his left and the scripture was fulfilled which saith and he wasnumbered with the transgressors and they that passed by railed on him wagging their heads andsaying ah thou that destroyest the temple and buildest it in threedays  save thyself and come down from the cross likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselveswith the scribes he saved others himself he cannot save let christ the king of israel descend now from the cross thatwe may see and believe and they that were crucified with him reviledhim and when the sixth hour was come there was darkness over thewhole land until the ninth hour and at the ninth hour jesus cried with a loud voice sayingeloi eloi lama sabachthani which is being interpreted my god mygod why hast thou forsaken me   and some of them that stood bywhen they heard it said behold he calleth elias and one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar and put it on areed and gave him to drink saying let alone let us see whetherelias will come to take him down and jesus cried with a loud voice and gave up the ghost and the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to thebottom and when the centurion which stood over against him saw thathe so cried out and gave up the ghost he said truly this man wasthe son of god there were also women looking on afar off among whom was marymagdalene and mary the mother of james the less and of joses andsalome  who also when he was in galilee followed him andministered unto him and many other women which came up with him untojerusalem and now when the even was come because it was the preparationthat is the day before the sabbath  joseph of arimathaea anhonourable counsellor which also waited for the kingdom of god cameand went in boldly unto pilate and craved the body of jesus and pilate marvelled if he were already dead and calling untohim the centurion he asked him whether he had been any while dead and when he knew it of the centurion he gave the body tojoseph and he bought fine linen and took him down and wrapped him inthe linen and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rockand rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre and mary magdalene and mary the mother of joses beheld where hewas laid and when the sabbath was past mary magdalene and mary themother of james and salome had bought sweet spices that they mightcome and anoint him and very early in the morning the first day of the week theycame unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun and they said among themselves who shall roll us away the stonefrom the door of the sepulchre   and when they looked they sawthat the stone was rolled away for it was very great and entering into the sepulchre they saw a young man sitting onthe right side clothed in a long white garment and they wereaffrighted and he saith unto them be not affrighted ye seek jesus ofnazareth which was crucified he is risen he is not here behold theplace where they laid him but go your way tell his disciples and peter that he goethbefore you into galilee there shall ye see him as he said unto you and they went out quickly and fled from the sepulchre for theytrembled and were amazed neither said they any thing to any man forthey were afraid now when jesus was risen early the first day of the week heappeared first to mary magdalene out of whom he had cast sevendevils and she went and told them that had been with him as theymourned and wept and they when they had heard that he was alive and had beenseen of her believed not after that he appeared in another form unto two of them as theywalked and went into the country and they went and told it unto the residue neither believedthey them afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat andupbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart because theybelieved not them which had seen him after he was risen and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach thegospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he thatbelieveth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shallthey cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues  theyshall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shallnot hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shallrecover so then after the lord had spoken unto them he was received upinto heaven and sat on the right hand of god and they went forth and preached every where the lord workingwith them and confirming the word with signs following amenthe gospel according to saint luke forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order adeclaration of those things which are most surely believed among us even as they delivered them unto us which from the beginning wereeyewitnesses and ministers of the word  it seemed good to mealso having had perfect understanding of all things from the veryfirst to write unto thee in order most excellent theophilus that thou mightest know the certainty of those things wherein thouhast been instructed there was in the days of herod the king of judaea a certainpriest named zacharias of the course of abia and his wife was of thedaughters of aaron and her name was elisabeth and they were both righteous before god walking in all thecommandments and ordinances of the lord blameless and they had no child because that elisabeth was barren and theyboth were now well stricken in years and it came to pass that while he executed the priests officebefore god in the order of his course  according to the custom ofthe priests office his lot was to burn incense when he went into thetemple of the lord and the whole multitude of the people were praying without at thetime of incense and there appeared unto him an angel of the lord standing on theright side of the altar of incense and when zacharias saw him he was troubled and fear fell uponhim but the angel said unto him fear not zacharias for thy prayeris heard and thy wife elisabeth shall bear thee a son and thou shaltcall his name john and thou shalt have joy and gladness and many shall rejoice athis birth for he shall be great in the sight of the lord and shall drinkneither wine nor strong drink and he shall be filled with the holyghost even from his mothers womb and many of the children of israel shall he turn to the lordtheir god and he shall go before him in the spirit and power of elias toturn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient tothe wisdom of the just to make ready a people prepared for the lord and zacharias said unto the angel whereby shall i know this fori am an old man and my wife well stricken in years and the angel answering said unto him i am gabriel that standin the presence of god and am sent to speak unto thee and to shewthee these glad tidings and behold thou shalt be dumb and not able to speak until theday that these things shall be performed because thou believest notmy words which shall be fulfilled in their season and the people waited for zacharias and marvelled that hetarried so long in the temple and when he came out he could not speak unto them and theyperceived that he had seen a vision in the temple for he beckonedunto them and remained speechless and it came to pass that as soon as the days of hisministration were accomplished he departed to his own house and after those days his wife elisabeth conceived and hidherself five months saying  thus hath the lord dealt with me inthe days wherein he looked on me to take away my reproach among men and in the sixth month the angel gabriel was sent from god unto acity of galilee named nazareth  to a virgin espoused to a manwhose name was joseph of the house of david and the virgins namewas mary and the angel came in unto her and said hail thou that arthighly favoured the lord is with thee blessed art thou among women and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and cast inher mind what manner of salutation this should be and the angel said unto her fear not mary for thou hast foundfavour with god and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth ason and shalt call his name jesus he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highestand the lord god shall give unto him the throne of his father david and he shall reign over the house of jacob for ever and of hiskingdom there shall be no end then said mary unto the angel how shall this be seeing i knownot a man   and the angel answered and said unto her the holyghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shallovershadow thee therefore also that holy thing which shall be born ofthee shall be called the son of god and behold thy cousin elisabeth she hath also conceived a sonin her old age and this is the sixth month with her who was calledbarren for with god nothing shall be impossible and mary said behold the handmaid of the lord be it unto meaccording to thy word and the angel departed from her and mary arose in those days and went into the hill country withhaste into a city of juda  and entered into the house ofzacharias and saluted elisabeth and it came to pass that when elisabeth heard the salutation ofmary the babe leaped in her womb and elisabeth was filled with theholy ghost  and she spake out with a loud voice and saidblessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb and whence is this to me that the mother of my lord should cometo me   for lo as soon as the voice of thy salutation soundedin mine ears the babe leaped in my womb for joy and blessed is she that believed for there shall be aperformance of those things which were told her from the lord and mary said my soul doth magnify the lord  and my spirithath rejoiced in god my saviour for he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden forbehold from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed for he that is mighty hath done to me great things and holy ishis name and his mercy is on them that fear him from generation togeneration he hath shewed strength with his arm he hath scattered the proudin the imagination of their hearts he hath put down the mighty from their seats and exalted them oflow degree he hath filled the hungry with good things and the rich he hathsent empty away he hath holpen his servant israel in remembrance of his mercy as he spake to our fathers to abraham and to his seed for ever and mary abode with her about three months and returned to herown house now elisabeths full time came that she should be delivered andshe brought forth a son and her neighbours and her cousins heard how the lord had shewedgreat mercy upon her and they rejoiced with her and it came to pass that on the eighth day they came tocircumcise the child and they called him zacharias after the name ofhis father and his mother answered and said not so but he shall be calledjohn and they said unto her there is none of thy kindred that iscalled by this name and they made signs to his father how he would have him called and he asked for a writing table and wrote saying his name isjohn and they marvelled all and his mouth was opened immediately and his tongue loosed andhe spake and praised god and fear came on all that dwelt round about them and all thesesayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of judaea and all they that heard them laid them up in their heartssaying what manner of child shall this be and the hand of the lordwas with him and his father zacharias was filled with the holy ghost andprophesied saying  blessed be the lord god of israel for hehath visited and redeemed his people  and hath raised up an hornof salvation for us in the house of his servant david  as hespake by the mouth of his holy prophets which have been since theworld began  that we should be saved from our enemies and fromthe hand of all that hate us  to perform the mercy promised toour fathers and to remember his holy covenant  the oath which hesware to our father abraham  that he would grant unto us that webeing delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him withoutfear  in holiness and righteousness before him all the days ofour life and thou child shalt be called the prophet of the highest forthou shalt go before the face of the lord to prepare his ways  togive knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of theirsins  through the tender mercy of our god whereby the dayspringfrom on high hath visited us  to give light to them that sit indarkness and in the shadow of death to guide our feet into the way ofpeace and the child grew and waxed strong in spirit and was in thedeserts till the day of his shewing unto israel and it came to pass in those days that there went out a decreefrom caesar augustus that all the world should be taxed and this taxing was first made when cyrenius was governor ofsyria   and all went to be taxed every one into his own city and joseph also went up from galilee out of the city of nazarethinto judaea unto the city of david which is called bethlehembecause he was of the house and lineage of david  to be taxedwith mary his espoused wife being great with child and so it was that while they were there the days wereaccomplished that she should be delivered and she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him inswaddling clothes and laid him in a manger because there was no roomfor them in the inn and there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the fieldkeeping watch over their flock by night and lo the angel of the lord came upon them and the glory ofthe lord shone round about them and they were sore afraid and the angel said unto them fear not for behold i bring yougood tidings of great joy which shall be to all people for unto you is born this day in the city of david a saviourwhich is christ the lord and this shall be a sign unto you ye shall find the babe wrappedin swaddling clothes lying in a manger and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenlyhost praising god and saying  glory to god in the highest andon earth peace good will toward men and it came to pass as the angels were gone away from them intoheaven the shepherds said one to another let us now go even untobethlehem and see this thing which is come to pass which the lordhath made known unto us and they came with haste and found mary and joseph and thebabe lying in a manger and when they had seen it they made known abroad the sayingwhich was told them concerning this child and all they that heard it wondered at those things which weretold them by the shepherds but mary kept all these things and pondered them in her heart and the shepherds returned glorifying and praising god for allthe things that they had heard and seen as it was told unto them and when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of thechild his name was called jesus which was so named of the angelbefore he was conceived in the womb and when the days of her purification according to the law ofmoses were accomplished they brought him to jerusalem to present himto the lord  as it is written in the law of the lord every malethat openeth the womb shall be called holy to the lord  and tooffer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of thelord a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons and behold there was a man in jerusalem whose name was simeonand the same man was just and devout waiting for the consolation ofisrael and the holy ghost was upon him and it was revealed unto him by the holy ghost that he shouldnot see death before he had seen the lords christ and he came by the spirit into the temple and when the parentsbrought in the child jesus to do for him after the custom of the law then took he him up in his arms and blessed god and said lord now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace according to thyword  for mine eyes have seen thy salvation  which thou hastprepared before the face of all people  a light to lighten thegentiles and the glory of thy people israel and joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which werespoken of him and simeon blessed them and said unto mary his mother beholdthis child is set for the fall and rising again of many in israel andfor a sign which shall be spoken against  yea a sword shallpierce through thy own soul also that the thoughts of many heartsmay be revealed and there was one anna a prophetess the daughter of phanuel ofthe tribe of aser she was of a great age and had lived with anhusband seven years from her virginity  and she was a widow ofabout fourscore and four years which departed not from the templebut served god with fastings and prayers night and day and she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto thelord and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption injerusalem and when they had performed all things according to the law ofthe lord they returned into galilee to their own city nazareth and the child grew and waxed strong in spirit filled withwisdom and the grace of god was upon him now his parents went to jerusalem every year at the feast of thepassover and when he was twelve years old they went up to jerusalem afterthe custom of the feast and when they had fulfilled the days as they returned the childjesus tarried behind in jerusalem and joseph and his mother knew notof it but they supposing him to have been in the company went a daysjourney and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance and when they found him not they turned back again to jerusalemseeking him and it came to pass that after three days they found him in thetemple sitting in the midst of the doctors both hearing them andasking them questions and all that heard him were astonished at his understanding andanswers and when they saw him they were amazed and his mother said untohim son why hast thou thus dealt with us behold thy father and ihave sought thee sorrowing and he said unto them how is it that ye sought me wist ye notthat i must be about my fathers business   and they understoodnot the saying which he spake unto them and he went down with them and came to nazareth and was subjectunto them but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart and jesus increased in wisdom and stature and in favour with godand man now in the fifteenth year of the reign of tiberius caesar pontiuspilate being governor of judaea and herod being tetrarch of galileeand his brother philip tetrarch of ituraea and of the region oftrachonitis and lysanias the tetrarch of abilene  annas andcaiaphas being the high priests the word of god came unto john theson of zacharias in the wilderness and he came into all the country about jordan preaching thebaptism of repentance for the remission of sins  as it is writtenin the book of the words of esaias the prophet saying the voice ofone crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the lord make hispaths straight every valley shall be filled and every mountain and hill shall bebrought low and the crooked shall be made straight and the roughways shall be made smooth  and all flesh shall see the salvationof god then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized ofhim o generation of vipers who hath warned you to flee from thewrath to come   bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentanceand begin not to say within yourselves we have abraham to our fatherfor i say unto you that god is able of these stones to raise upchildren unto abraham and now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees everytree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down andcast into the fire and the people asked him saying what shall we do then   heanswereth and saith unto them he that hath two coats let him impartto him that hath none and he that hath meat let him do likewise then came also publicans to be baptized and said unto himmaster what shall we do   and he said unto them exact no morethan that which is appointed you and the soldiers likewise demanded of him saying and what shallwe do and he said unto them do violence to no man neither accuseany falsely and be content with your wages and as the people were in expectation and all men mused in theirhearts of john whether he were the christ or not  johnanswered saying unto them all i indeed baptize you with water butone mightier than i cometh the latchet of whose shoes i am not worthyto unloose he shall baptize you with the holy ghost and with fire whose fan is in his hand and he will throughly purge his floorand will gather the wheat into his garner but the chaff he will burnwith fire unquenchable and many other things in his exhortation preached he unto thepeople but herod the tetrarch being reproved by him for herodias hisbrother philips wife and for all the evils which herod had done added yet this above all that he shut up john in prison now when all the people were baptized it came to pass thatjesus also being baptized and praying the heaven was opened and the holy ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon himand a voice came from heaven which said thou art my beloved son inthee i am well pleased and jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age beingas was supposed the son of joseph which was the son of heli which was the son of matthat which

and jesus being full of the holy ghost returned from jordan andwas led by the spirit into the wilderness  being forty daystempted of the devil and in those days he did eat nothing and whenthey were ended he afterward hungered and the devil said unto him if thou be the son of god commandthis stone that it be made bread and jesus answered him saying it is written that man shall notlive by bread alone but by every word of god and the devil taking him up into an high mountain shewed untohim all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time and the devil said unto him all this power will i give thee andthe glory of them for that is delivered unto me and to whomsoever iwill i give it if thou therefore wilt worship me all shall be thine and jesus answered and said unto him get thee behind me satanfor it is written thou shalt worship the lord thy god and him onlyshalt thou serve and he brought him to jerusalem and set him on a pinnacle of thetemple and said unto him if thou be the son of god cast thyselfdown from hence  for it is written he shall give his angelscharge over thee to keep thee  and in their hands they shallbear thee up lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone and jesus answering said unto him it is said thou shalt nottempt the lord thy god and when the devil had ended all the temptation he departed fromhim for a season and jesus returned in the power of the spirit into galilee andthere went out a fame of him through all the region round about and he taught in their synagogues being glorified of all and he came to nazareth where he had been brought up and ashis custom was he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day andstood up for to read and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet esaiasand when he had opened the book he found the place where it waswritten  the spirit of the lord is upon me because he hathanointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he hath sent me to healthe brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives andrecovering of sight to the blind to set at liberty them that arebruised  to preach the acceptable year of the lord and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister andsat down and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue werefastened on him and he began to say unto them this day is this scripturefulfilled in your ears and all bare him witness and wondered at the gracious wordswhich proceeded out of his mouth and they said is not this josephsson   and he said unto them ye will surely say unto me thisproverb physician heal thyself whatsoever we have heard done incapernaum do also here in thy country and he said verily i say unto you no prophet is accepted in hisown country but i tell you of a truth many widows were in israel in the daysof elias when the heaven was shut up three years and six months whengreat famine was throughout all the land  but unto none of themwas elias sent save unto sarepta a city of sidon unto a woman thatwas a widow and many lepers were in israel in the time of eliseus theprophet and none of them was cleansed saving naaman the syrian and all they in the synagogue when they heard these things werefilled with wrath  and rose up and thrust him out of the cityand led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was builtthat they might cast him down headlong but he passing through the midst of them went his way  andcame down to capernaum a city of galilee and taught them on thesabbath days and they were astonished at his doctrine for his word was withpower and in the synagogue there was a man which had a spirit of anunclean devil and cried out with a loud voice  saying let usalone what have we to do with thee thou jesus of nazareth art thoucome to destroy us i know thee who thou art the holy one of god and jesus rebuked him saying hold thy peace and come out ofhimand when the devil had thrown him in the midst he came out of himand hurt him not and they were all amazed and spake among themselves sayingwhat a word is this for with authority and power he commandeth theunclean spirits and they come out and the fame of him went out into every place of the countryround about and he arose out of the synagogue and entered into simonshouseand simons wifes mother was taken with a great fever and theybesought him for her and he stood over her and rebuked the fever and it left herand immediately she arose and ministered unto them now when the sun was setting all they that had any sick withdivers diseases brought them unto him and he laid his hands on everyone of them and healed them and devils also came out of many crying out and saying thouart christ the son of god and he rebuking them suffered them not tospeak for they knew that he was christ and when it was day he departed and went into a desert placeand the people sought him and came unto him and stayed him that heshould not depart from them and he said unto them i must preach the kingdom of god to othercities also for therefore am i sent and he preached in the synagogues of galilee and it came to pass that as the people pressed upon him to hearthe word of god he stood by the lake of gennesaret  and saw twoships standing by the lake but the fishermen were gone out of themand were washing their nets and he entered into one of the ships which was simons andprayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land and he satdown and taught the people out of the ship now when he had left speaking he said unto simon launch out intothe deep and let down your nets for a draught and simon answering said unto him master we have toiled all thenight and have taken nothing nevertheless at thy word i will letdown the net and when they had this done they inclosed a great multitude offishes and their net brake and they beckoned unto their partners which were in the othership that they should come and help them and they came and filledboth the ships so that they began to sink when simon peter saw it he fell down at jesus knees sayingdepart from me for i am a sinful man o lord for he was astonished and all that were with him at the draughtof the fishes which they had taken  and so was also james andjohn the sons of zebedee which were partners with simon and jesussaid unto simon fear not from henceforth thou shalt catch men and when they had brought their ships to land they forsook alland followed him and it came to pass when he was in a certain city behold a manfull of leprosy who seeing jesus fell on his face and besought himsaying lord if thou wilt thou canst make me clean and he put forth his hand and touched him saying i will bethou clean and immediately the leprosy departed from him and he charged him to tell no man but go and shew thyself tothe priest and offer for thy cleansing according as moses commandedfor a testimony unto them but so much the more went there a fame abroad of him and greatmultitudes came together to hear and to be healed by him of theirinfirmities and he withdrew himself into the wilderness and prayed and it came to pass on a certain day as he was teaching thatthere were pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by which werecome out of every town of galilee and judaea and jerusalem and thepower of the lord was present to heal them and behold men brought in a bed a man which was taken with apalsy and they sought means to bring him in and to lay him beforehim and when they could not find by what way they might bring him inbecause of the multitude they went upon the housetop and let himdown through the tiling with his couch into the midst before jesus and when he saw their faith he said unto him man thy sins areforgiven thee and the scribes and the pharisees began to reason saying who isthis which speaketh blasphemies who can forgive sins but god alone but when jesus perceived their thoughts he answering said untothem what reason ye in your hearts   whether is easier to saythy sins be forgiven thee or to say rise up and walk   but thatye may know that the son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sinshe said unto the sick of the palsy i say unto thee arise and takeup thy couch and go into thine house and immediately he rose up before them and took up that whereonhe lay and departed to his own house glorifying god and they were all amazed and they glorified god and were filledwith fear saying we have seen strange things to day and after these things he went forth and saw a publican namedlevi sitting at the receipt of custom and he said unto him followme and he left all rose up and followed him and levi made him a great feast in his own house and there was agreat company of publicans and of others that sat down with them but their scribes and pharisees murmured against his disciplessaying why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners   andjesus answering said unto them they that are whole need not aphysician but they that are sick i came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance and they said unto him why do the disciples of john fast oftenand make prayers and likewise the disciples of the pharisees butthine eat and drink   and he said unto them can ye make thechildren of the bridechamber fast while the bridegroom is with them but the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken awayfrom them and then shall they fast in those days and he spake also a parable unto them no man putteth a piece ofa new garment upon an old if otherwise then both the new maketh arent and the piece that was taken out of the new agreeth not with theold and no man putteth new wine into old bottles else the new winewill burst the bottles and be spilled and the bottles shall perish but new wine must be put into new bottles and both arepreserved no man also having drunk old wine straightway desireth new forhe saith the old is better and it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first that hewent through the corn fields and his disciples plucked the ears ofcorn and did eat rubbing them in their hands and certain of the pharisees said unto them why do ye that whichis not lawful to do on the sabbath days   and jesus answering themsaid have ye not read so much as this what david did when himselfwas an hungred and they which were with him  how he went into thehouse of god and did take and eat the shewbread and gave also tothem that were with him which it is not lawful to eat but for thepriests alone   and he said unto them that the son of man is lordalso of the sabbath and it came to pass also on another sabbath that he entered intothe synagogue and taught and there was a man whose right hand waswithered and the scribes and pharisees watched him whether he would healon the sabbath day that they might find an accusation against him but he knew their thoughts and said to the man which had thewithered hand rise up and stand forth in the midst and he arose andstood forth then said jesus unto them i will ask you one thing is it lawfulon the sabbath days to do good or to do evil to save life or todestroy it   and looking round about upon them all he said untothe man stretch forth thy hand and he did so and his hand wasrestored whole as the other and they were filled with madness and communed one with anotherwhat they might do to jesus and it came to pass in those days that he went out into amountain to pray and continued all night in prayer to god and when it was day he called unto him his disciples and ofthem he chose twelve whom also he named apostles  simon whomhe also named peter and andrew his brother james and john philipand bartholomew  matthew and thomas james the son of alphaeusand simon called zelotes  and judas the brother of james andjudas iscariot which also was the traitor and he came down with them and stood in the plain and thecompany of his disciples and a great multitude of people out of alljudaea and jerusalem and from the sea coast of tyre and sidon whichcame to hear him and to be healed of their diseases  and theythat were vexed with unclean spirits and they were healed and the whole multitude sought to touch him for there wentvirtue out of him and healed them all and he lifted up his eyes on his disciples and said blessed beye poor for yours is the kingdom of god blessed are ye that hunger now for ye shall be filled blessedare ye that weep now for ye shall laugh blessed are ye when men shall hate you and when they shallseparate you from their company and shall reproach you and cast outyour name as evil for the son of mans sake rejoice ye in that day and leap for joy for behold yourreward is great in heaven for in the like manner did their fathersunto the prophets but woe unto you that are rich for ye have received yourconsolation woe unto you that are full for ye shall hunger woe unto youthat laugh now for ye shall mourn and weep woe unto you when all men shall speak well of you for so didtheir fathers to the false prophets but i say unto you which hear love your enemies do good to themwhich hate you  bless them that curse you and pray for themwhich despitefully use you and unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also theother and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take thy coatalso give to every man that asketh of thee and of him that takethaway thy goods ask them not again and as ye would that men should do to you do ye also to themlikewise for if ye love them which love you what thank have ye forsinners also love those that love them and if ye do good to them which do good to you what thank haveye  for sinners also do even the same and if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive what thankhave ye for sinners also lend to sinners to receive as much again but love ye your enemies and do good and lend hoping fornothing again and your reward shall be great and ye shall be thechildren of the highest for he is kind unto the unthankful and to theevil be ye therefore merciful as your father also is merciful judge not and ye shall not be judged condemn not and ye shallnot be condemned forgive and ye shall be forgiven  give and itshall be given unto you good measure pressed down and shakentogether and running over shall men give into your bosom for withthe same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to youagain and he spake a parable unto them can the blind lead the blindshall they not both fall into the ditch   the disciple is notabove his master but every one that is perfect shall be as hismaster and why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brothers eye butperceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye   either howcanst thou say to thy brother brother let me pull out the mote thatis in thine eye when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is inthine own eye thou hypocrite cast out first the beam out of thineown eye and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that isin thy brothers eye for a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit neither doth acorrupt tree bring forth good fruit for every tree is known by his own fruit for of thorns men donot gather figs nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes a good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forththat which is good and an evil man out of the evil treasure of hisheart bringeth forth that which is evil for of the abundance of theheart his mouth speaketh and why call ye me lord lord and do not the things which isay   whosoever cometh to me and heareth my sayings and doeththem i will shew you to whom he is like  he is like a man whichbuilt an house and digged deep and laid the foundation on a rockand when the flood arose the stream beat vehemently upon that houseand could not shake it for it was founded upon a rock but he that heareth and doeth not is like a man that without afoundation built an house upon the earth against which the stream didbeat vehemently and immediately it fell and the ruin of that housewas great now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of thepeople he entered into capernaum and a certain centurions servant who was dear unto him wassick and ready to die and when he heard of jesus he sent unto him the elders of thejews beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant and when they came to jesus they besought him instantly sayingthat he was worthy for whom he should do this  for he loveth ournation and he hath built us a synagogue then jesus went with them and when he was now not far from thehouse the centurion sent friends to him saying unto him lordtrouble not thyself for i am not worthy that thou shouldest enterunder my roof  wherefore neither thought i myself worthy to comeunto thee but say in a word and my servant shall be healed for i also am a man set under authority having under me soldiersand i say unto one go and he goeth and to another come and hecometh and to my servant do this and he doeth it when jesus heard these things he marvelled at him and turned himabout and said unto the people that followed him i say unto you ihave not found so great faith no not in israel and they that were sent returning to the house found theservant whole that had been sick and it came to pass the day after that he went into a citycalled nain and many of his disciples went with him and much people now when he came nigh to the gate of the city behold there wasa dead man carried out the only son of his mother and she was awidow and much people of the city was with her and when the lord saw her he had compassion on her and saidunto her weep not and he came and touched the bier and they that bare him stoodstilland he said young man i say unto thee arise and he that was dead sat up and began to speak and he deliveredhim to his mother and there came a fear on all and they glorified god sayingthat a great prophet is risen up among us and that god hath visitedhis people and this rumour of him went forth throughout all judaea andthroughout all the region round about and the disciples of john shewed him of all these things and john calling unto him two of his disciples sent them tojesus saying art thou he that should come or look we for another when the men were come unto him they said john baptist hathsent us unto thee saying art thou he that should come or look wefor another   and in that same hour he cured many of theirinfirmities and plagues and of evil spirits and unto many that wereblind he gave sight then jesus answering said unto them go your way and tell johnwhat things ye have seen and heard how that the blind see the lamewalk the lepers are cleansed the deaf hear the dead are raised tothe poor the gospel is preached and blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me and when the messengers of john were departed he began to speakunto the people concerning john what went ye out into the wildernessfor to see  a reed shaken with the wind   but what went ye outfor to see a man clothed in soft raiment  behold they which aregorgeously apparelled and live delicately are in kings courts but what went ye out for to see a prophet yea i say unto youand much more than a prophet this is he of whom it is written behold i send my messengerbefore thy face which shall prepare thy way before thee for i say unto you among those that are born of women there isnot a greater prophet than john the baptist but he that is least inthe kingdom of god is greater than he and all the people that heard him and the publicans justifiedgod being baptized with the baptism of john but the pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of god againstthemselves being not baptized of him and the lord said whereunto then shall i liken the men of thisgeneration and to what are they like   they are like untochildren sitting in the marketplace and calling one to another andsaying we have piped unto you and ye have not danced we havemourned to you and ye have not wept for john the baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wineand ye say he hath a devil the son of man is come eating and drinking and ye say behold agluttonous man and a winebibber a friend of publicans and sinners but wisdom is justified of all her children and one of the pharisees desired him that he would eat with himand he went into the pharisees house and sat down to meat and behold a woman in the city which was a sinner when sheknew that jesus sat at meat in the pharisees house brought analabaster box of ointment  and stood at his feet behind himweeping and began to wash his feet with tears and did wipe them withthe hairs of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with theointment now when the pharisee which had bidden him saw it he spakewithin himself saying this man if he were a prophet would haveknown who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him for sheis a sinner and jesus answering said unto him simon i have somewhat to sayunto thee and he saith master say on there was a certain creditor which had two debtors the one owedfive hundred pence and the other fifty and when they had nothing to pay he frankly forgave them bothtell me therefore which of them will love him most   simonanswered and said i suppose that he to whom he forgave mostand he said unto him thou hast rightly judged and he turned to the woman and said unto simon seest thou thiswoman i entered into thine house thou gavest me no water for myfeet but she hath washed my feet with tears and wiped them with thehairs of her head thou gavest me no kiss but this woman since the time i came inhath not ceased to kiss my feet my head with oil thou didst not anoint but this woman hathanointed my feet with ointment wherefore i say unto thee her sins which are many areforgiven for she loved much but to whom little is forgiven the sameloveth little and he said unto her thy sins are forgiven and they that sat at meat with him began to say withinthemselves who is this that forgiveth sins also   and he said tothe woman thy faith hath saved thee go in peace and it came to pass afterward that he went throughout every cityand village preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom ofgod and the twelve were with him  and certain women which hadbeen healed of evil spirits and infirmities mary called magdaleneout of whom went seven devils  and joanna the wife of chuzaherods steward and susanna and many others which ministered untohim of their substance and when much people were gathered together and were come to himout of every city he spake by a parable  a sower went out to sowhis seed and as he sowed some fell by the way side and it wastrodden down and the fowls of the air devoured it and some fell upon a rock and as soon as it was sprung up itwithered away because it lacked moisture and some fell among thorns and the thorns sprang up with it andchoked it and other fell on good ground and sprang up and bare fruit anhundredfold and when he had said these things he cried he that hathears to hear let him hear and his disciples asked him saying what might this parable be and he said unto you it is given to know the mysteries of thekingdom of god but to others in parables that seeing they might notsee and hearing they might not understand now the parable is this the seed is the word of god those by the way side are they that hear then cometh the deviland taketh away the word out of their hearts lest they should believeand be saved they on the rock are they which when they hear receive theword with joy and these have no root which for a while believe andin time of temptation fall away and that which fell among thorns are they which when they haveheard go forth and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures ofthis life and bring no fruit to perfection but that on the good ground are they which in an honest and goodheart having heard the word keep it and bring forth fruit withpatience no man when he hath lighted a candle covereth it with a vesselor putteth it under a bed but setteth it on a candlestick that theywhich enter in may see the light for nothing is secret that shall not be made manifest neitherany thing hid that shall not be known and come abroad take heed therefore how ye hear for whosoever hath to him shallbe given and whosoever hath not from him shall be taken even thatwhich he seemeth to have then came to him his mother and his brethren and could not comeat him for the press and it was told him by certain which said thy mother and thybrethren stand without desiring to see thee and he answered and said unto them my mother and my brethren arethese which hear the word of god and do it now it came to pass on a certain day that he went into a shipwith his disciples and he said unto them let us go over unto theother side of the lake and they launched forth but as they sailed he fell asleep and there came down a storm ofwind on the lake and they were filled with water and were injeopardy and they came to him and awoke him saying master master weperish then he arose and rebuked the wind and the raging of thewater and they ceased and there was a calm and he said unto them where is your faith and they being afraidwondered saying one to another what manner of man is this for hecommandeth even the winds and water and they obey him and they arrived at the country of the gadarenes which is overagainst galilee and when he went forth to land there met him out of the city acertain man which had devils long time and ware no clothes neitherabode in any house but in the tombs when he saw jesus he cried out and fell down before him andwith a loud voice said what have i to do with thee jesus thou sonof god most high i beseech thee torment me not for he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the manfor oftentimes it had caught him and he was kept bound with chainsand in fetters and he brake the bands and was driven of the devilinto the wilderness   and jesus asked him saying what is thyname and he said legion because many devils were entered into him and they besought him that he would not command them to go outinto the deep and there was there an herd of many swine feeding on themountain and they besought him that he would suffer them to enterinto them and he suffered them then went the devils out of the man and entered into the swineand the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake and werechoked when they that fed them saw what was done they fled and wentand told it in the city and in the country then they went out to see what was done and came to jesus andfound the man out of whom the devils were departed sitting at thefeet of jesus clothed and in his right mind and they were afraid they also which saw it told them by what means he that waspossessed of the devils was healed then the whole multitude of the country of the gadarenes roundabout besought him to depart from them for they were taken with greatfear and he went up into the ship and returned back again now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought himthat he might be with him but jesus sent him away saying return to thine own house and shew how great things god hath doneunto thee and he went his way and published throughout the wholecity how great things jesus had done unto him and it came to pass that when jesus was returned the peoplegladly received him for they were all waiting for him and behold there came a man named jairus and he was a ruler ofthe synagogue and he fell down at jesus feet and besought him thathe would come into his house  for he had one only daughter abouttwelve years of age and she lay a dying but as he went the peoplethronged him and a woman having an issue of blood twelve years which hadspent all her living upon physicians neither could be healed of any came behind him and touched the border of his garment andimmediately her issue of blood stanched and jesus said who touched me when all denied peter and theythat were with him said master the multitude throng thee and pressthee and sayest thou who touched me   and jesus said somebodyhath touched me for i perceive that virtue is gone out of me and when the woman saw that she was not hid she came tremblingand falling down before him she declared unto him before all thepeople for what cause she had touched him and how she was healedimmediately and he said unto her daughter be of good comfort thy faithhath made thee whole go in peace while he yet spake there cometh one from the ruler of thesynagogues house saying to him thy daughter is dead trouble notthe master but when jesus heard it he answered him saying fear notbelieve only and she shall be made whole and when he came into the house he suffered no man to go insave peter and james and john and the father and the mother of themaiden and all wept and bewailed her but he said weep not she is notdead but sleepeth and they laughed him to scorn knowing that she was dead and he put them all out and took her by the hand and calledsaying maid arise and her spirit came again and she arose straightway and hecommanded to give her meat and her parents were astonished but he charged them that theyshould tell no man what was done then he called his twelve disciples together and gave them powerand authority over all devils and to cure diseases and he sent them to preach the kingdom of god and to heal thesick and he said unto them take nothing for your journey neitherstaves nor scrip neither bread neither money neither have twocoats apiece and whatsoever house ye enter into there abide and thencedepart and whosoever will not receive you when ye go out of that cityshake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them and they departed and went through the towns preaching thegospel and healing every where now herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him and hewas perplexed because that it was said of some that john was risenfrom the dead  and of some that elias had appeared and ofothers that one of the old prophets was risen again and herod said john have i beheaded but who is this of whom ihear such things and he desired to see him and the apostles when they were returned told him all that theyhad done and he took them and went aside privately into a desertplace belonging to the city called bethsaida and the people when they knew it followed him and he receivedthem and spake unto them of the kingdom of god and healed them thathad need of healing and when the day began to wear away then came the twelve andsaid unto him send the multitude away that they may go into thetowns and country round about and lodge and get victuals for we arehere in a desert place but he said unto them give ye them to eat and they said wehave no more but five loaves and two fishes except we should go andbuy meat for all this people for they were about five thousand men and he said to hisdisciples make them sit down by fifties in a company and they did so and made them all sit down then he took the five loaves and the two fishes and looking upto heaven he blessed them and brake and gave to the disciples toset before the multitude and they did eat and were all filled and there was taken up offragments that remained to them twelve baskets and it came to pass as he was alone praying his disciples werewith him and he asked them saying whom say the people that i am they answering said john the baptist but some say elias andothers say that one of the old prophets is risen again he said unto them but whom say ye that i am peter answeringsaid the christ of god and he straitly charged them and commanded them to tell no manthat thing  saying the son of man must suffer many things andbe rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes and be slainand be raised the third day and he said to them all if any man will come after me let himdeny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoeverwill lose his life for my sake the same shall save it for what is a man advantaged if he gain the whole world andlose himself or be cast away   for whosoever shall be ashamed ofme and of my words of him shall the son of man be ashamed when heshall come in his own glory and in his fathers and of the holyangels but i tell you of a truth there be some standing here whichshall not taste of death till they see the kingdom of god and it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings hetook peter and john and james and went up into a mountain to pray and as he prayed the fashion of his countenance was altered andhis raiment was white and glistering and behold there talked with him two men which were moses andelias  who appeared in glory and spake of his decease which heshould accomplish at jerusalem but peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep andwhen they were awake they saw his glory and the two men that stoodwith him and it came to pass as they departed from him peter said untojesus master it is good for us to be here and let us make threetabernacles one for thee and one for moses and one for elias notknowing what he said while he thus spake there came a cloud and overshadowed themand they feared as they entered into the cloud and there came a voice out of the cloud saying this is mybeloved son hear him and when the voice was past jesus was found alone and they keptit close and told no man in those days any of those things which theyhad seen and it came to pass that on the next day when they were comedown from the hill much people met him and behold a man of the company cried out saying master ibeseech thee look upon my son for he is mine only child and lo a spirit taketh him and he suddenly crieth out and itteareth him that he foameth again and bruising him hardly departethfrom him and i besought thy disciples to cast him out and they could not and jesus answering said o faithless and perverse generationhow long shall i be with you and suffer you bring thy son hither and as he was yet a coming the devil threw him down and tarehimand jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the child anddelivered him again to his father and they were all amazed at the mighty power of god but whilethey wondered every one at all things which jesus did he said untohis disciples  let these sayings sink down into your ears forthe son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men but they understood not this saying and it was hid from themthat they perceived it not and they feared to ask him of that saying then there arose a reasoning among them which of them should begreatest and jesus perceiving the thought of their heart took a childand set him by him  and said unto them whosoever shall receivethis child in my name receiveth me and whosoever shall receive mereceiveth him that sent me for he that is least among you all thesame shall be great and john answered and said master we saw one casting out devilsin thy name and we forbad him because he followeth not with us and jesus said unto him forbid him not for he that is notagainst us is for us and it came to pass when the time was come that he should bereceived up he stedfastly set his face to go to jerusalem  andsent messengers before his face and they went and entered into avillage of the samaritans to make ready for him and they did not receive him because his face was as though hewould go to jerusalem and when his disciples james and john saw this they said lordwilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven and consumethem even as elias did   but he turned and rebuked them andsaid ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of for the son of man is not come to destroy mens lives but tosave them and they went to another village and it came to pass that as they went in the way a certain mansaid unto him lord i will follow thee whithersoever thou goest and jesus said unto him foxes have holes and birds of the airhave nests but the son of man hath not where to lay his head and he said unto another follow me but he said lord suffer mefirst to go and bury my father jesus said unto him let the dead bury their dead but go thouand preach the kingdom of god and another also said lord i will follow thee but let me firstgo bid them farewell which are at home at my house and jesus said unto him no man having put his hand to theplough and looking back is fit for the kingdom of god after these things the lord appointed other seventy also andsent them two and two before his face into every city and placewhither he himself would come therefore said he unto them the harvest truly is great but thelabourers are few pray ye therefore the lord of the harvest that hewould send forth labourers into his harvest go your ways behold i send you forth as lambs among wolves carry neither purse nor scrip nor shoes and salute no man bythe way and into whatsoever house ye enter first say peace be to thishouse and if the son of peace be there your peace shall rest upon itif not it shall turn to you again and in the same house remain eating and drinking such things asthey give for the labourer is worthy of his hire go not from houseto house and into whatsoever city ye enter and they receive you eat suchthings as are set before you  and heal the sick that are thereinand say unto them the kingdom of god is come nigh unto you but into whatsoever city ye enter and they receive you not goyour ways out into the streets of the same and say  even thevery dust of your city which cleaveth on us we do wipe off againstyou notwithstanding be ye sure of this that the kingdom of god iscome nigh unto you but i say unto you that it shall be more tolerable in that dayfor sodom than for that city woe unto thee chorazin woe unto thee bethsaida for if themighty works had been done in tyre and sidon which have been done inyou they had a great while ago repented sitting in sackcloth andashes but it shall be more tolerable for tyre and sidon at thejudgment than for you and thou capernaum which art exalted to heaven shalt bethrust down to hell he that heareth you heareth me and he that despiseth youdespiseth me and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me and the seventy returned again with joy saying lord even thedevils are subject unto us through thy name and he said unto them i beheld satan as lightning fall fromheaven behold i give unto you power to tread on serpents andscorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall byany means hurt you notwithstanding in this rejoice not that the spirits aresubject unto you but rather rejoice because your names are writtenin heaven in that hour jesus rejoiced in spirit and said i thank thee ofather lord of heaven and earth that thou hast hid these things fromthe wise and prudent and hast revealed them unto babes even sofather for so it seemed good in thy sight all things are delivered to me of my father and no man knowethwho the son is but the father and who the father is but the sonand he to whom the son will reveal him and he turned him unto his disciples and said privatelyblessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see  for itell you that many prophets and kings have desired to see thosethings which ye see and have not seen them and to hear those thingswhich ye hear and have not heard them and behold a certain lawyer stood up and tempted him sayingmaster what shall i do to inherit eternal life   he said untohim what is written in the law how readest thou   and heanswering said thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heartand with all thy soul and with all thy strength and with all thymind and thy neighbour as thyself and he said unto him thou hast answered right this do andthou shalt live but he willing to justify himself said unto jesus and who ismy neighbour   and jesus answering said a certain man went downfrom jerusalem to jericho and fell among thieves which stripped himof his raiment and wounded him and departed leaving him half dead and by chance there came down a certain priest that way andwhen he saw him he passed by on the other side and likewise a levite when he was at the place came and lookedon him and passed by on the other side but a certain samaritan as he journeyed came where he was andwhen he saw him he had compassion on him  and went to him andbound up his wounds pouring in oil and wine and set him on his ownbeast and brought him to an inn and took care of him and on the morrow when he departed he took out two pence andgave them to the host and said unto him take care of him andwhatsoever thou spendest more when i come again i will repay thee which now of these three thinkest thou was neighbour unto himthat fell among the thieves   and he said he that shewed mercyon him then said jesus unto him go and do thou likewise now it came to pass as they went that he entered into acertain village and a certain woman named martha received him intoher house and she had a sister called mary which also sat at jesus feetand heard his word but martha was cumbered about much serving and came to him andsaid lord dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to servealone  bid her therefore that she help me and jesus answered and said unto her martha martha thou artcareful and troubled about many things  but one thing isneedful and mary hath chosen that good part which shall not be takenaway from her and it came to pass that as he was praying in a certain placewhen he ceased one of his disciples said unto him lord teach us topray as john also taught his disciples and he said unto them when ye pray say our father which art inheaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done asin heaven so in earth give us day by day our daily bread and forgive us our sins for we also forgive every one that isindebted to us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us fromevil and he said unto them which of you shall have a friend andshall go unto him at midnight and say unto him friend lend me threeloaves  for a friend of mine in his journey is come to me and ihave nothing to set before him   and he from within shall answerand say trouble me not the door is now shut and my children arewith me in bed i cannot rise and give thee i say unto you though he will not rise and give him because heis his friend yet because of his importunity he will rise and givehim as many as he needeth and i say unto you ask and it shall be given you seek and yeshall find knock and it shall be opened unto you for every one that asketh receiveth and he that seekethfindeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened if a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father will hegive him a stone or if he ask a fish will he for a fish give him aserpent   or if he shall ask an egg will he offer him ascorpion   if ye then being evil know how to give good giftsunto your children how much more shall your heavenly father give theholy spirit to them that ask him   and he was casting out adevil and it was dumb and it came to pass when the devil was goneout the dumb spake and the people wondered but some of them said he casteth out devils through beelzebubthe chief of the devils and others tempting him sought of him a sign from heaven but he knowing their thoughts said unto them every kingdomdivided against itself is brought to desolation and a house dividedagainst a house falleth if satan also be divided against himself how shall his kingdomstand because ye say that i cast out devils through beelzebub and if i by beelzebub cast out devils by whom do your sons castthem out therefore shall they be your judges but if i with the finger of god cast out devils no doubt thekingdom of god is come upon you when a strong man armed keepeth his palace his goods are inpeace  but when a stronger than he shall come upon him andovercome him he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trustedand divideth his spoils he that is not with me is against me and he that gathereth notwith me scattereth when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man he walketh throughdry places seeking rest and finding none he saith i will returnunto my house whence i came out and when he cometh he findeth it swept and garnished then goeth he and taketh to him seven other spirits more wickedthan himself and they enter in and dwell there and the last stateof that man is worse than the first and it came to pass as he spake these things a certain womanof the company lifted up her voice and said unto him blessed is thewomb that bare thee and the paps which thou hast sucked but he said yea rather blessed are they that hear the word ofgod and keep it and when the people were gathered thick together he began tosay this is an evil generation they seek a sign and there shall nosign be given it but the sign of jonas the prophet for as jonas was a sign unto the ninevites so shall also theson of man be to this generation the queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with themen of this generation and condemn them for she came from the utmostparts of the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon and behold agreater than solomon is here the men of nineve shall rise up in the judgment with thisgeneration and shall condemn it for they repented at the preachingof jonas and behold a greater than jonas is here no man when he hath lighted a candle putteth it in a secretplace neither under a bushel but on a candlestick that they whichcome in may see the light the light of the body is the eye therefore when thine eye issingle thy whole body also is full of light but when thine eye isevil thy body also is full of darkness take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be notdarkness if thy whole body therefore be full of light having no partdark the whole shall be full of light as when the bright shining ofa candle doth give thee light and as he spake a certain pharisee besought him to dine withhim and he went in and sat down to meat and when the pharisee saw it he marvelled that he had not firstwashed before dinner and the lord said unto him now do ye pharisees make clean theoutside of the cup and the platter but your inward part is full ofravening and wickedness ye fools did not he that made that which is without make thatwhich is within also   but rather give alms of such things as yehave and behold all things are clean unto you but woe unto you pharisees for ye tithe mint and rue and allmanner of herbs and pass over judgment and the love of god theseought ye to have done and not to leave the other undone woe unto you pharisees for ye love the uppermost seats in thesynagogues and greetings in the markets woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye are asgraves which appear not and the men that walk over them are not awareof them then answered one of the lawyers and said unto him masterthus saying thou reproachest us also and he said woe unto you also ye lawyers for ye lade men withburdens grievous to be borne and ye yourselves touch not the burdenswith one of your fingers woe unto you for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets andyour fathers killed them truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathersfor they indeed killed them and ye build their sepulchres therefore also said the wisdom of god i will send them prophetsand apostles and some of them they shall slay and persecute that the blood of all the prophets which was shed from the foundationof the world may be required of this generation  from the bloodof abel unto the blood of zacharias which perished between the altarand the temple verily i say unto you it shall be required of thisgeneration woe unto you lawyers for ye have taken away the key ofknowledge ye entered not in yourselves and them that were enteringin ye hindered and as he said these things unto them the scribes and thepharisees began to urge him vehemently and to provoke him to speak ofmany things  laying wait for him and seeking to catch somethingout of his mouth that they might accuse him in the mean time when there were gathered together aninnumerable multitude of people insomuch that they trode one uponanother he began to say unto his disciples first of all beware ye ofthe leaven of the pharisees which is hypocrisy for there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed neitherhid that shall not be known therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard inthe light and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shallbe proclaimed upon the housetops and i say unto you my friends be not afraid of them that killthe body and after that have no more that they can do but i will forewarn you whom ye shall fear fear him which afterhe hath killed hath power to cast into hell yea i say unto you fearhim are not five sparrows sold for two farthings and not one of themis forgotten before god   but even the very hairs of your headare all numbered fear not therefore ye are of more value than manysparrows also i say unto you whosoever shall confess me before men himshall the son of man also confess before the angels of god  buthe that denieth me before men shall be denied before the angels ofgod and whosoever shall speak a word against the son of man itshall be forgiven him but unto him that blasphemeth against the holyghost it shall not be forgiven and when they bring you unto the synagogues and untomagistrates and powers take ye no thought how or what thing ye shallanswer or what ye shall say  for the holy ghost shall teach youin the same hour what ye ought to say and one of the company said unto him master speak to mybrother that he divide the inheritance with me and he said unto him man who made me a judge or a divider overyou   and he said unto them take heed and beware ofcovetousness for a mans life consisteth not in the abundance of thethings which he possesseth and he spake a parable unto them saying the ground of acertain rich man brought forth plentifully  and he thoughtwithin himself saying what shall i do because i have no room whereto bestow my fruits   and he said this will i do i will pulldown my barns and build greater and there will i bestow all myfruits and my goods and i will say to my soul soul thou hast much goods laid upfor many years take thine ease eat drink and be merry but god said unto him thou fool this night thy soul shall berequired of thee then whose shall those things be which thou hastprovided   so is he that layeth up treasure for himself and isnot rich toward god and he said unto his disciples therefore i say unto you takeno thought for your life what ye shall eat neither for the bodywhat ye shall put on the life is more than meat and the body is more than raiment consider the ravens for they neither sow nor reap whichneither have storehouse nor barn and god feedeth them how much moreare ye better than the fowls   and which of you with takingthought can add to his stature one cubit   if ye then be notable to do that thing which is least why take ye thought for therest   consider the lilies how they grow they toil not theyspin not and yet i say unto you that solomon in all his glory wasnot arrayed like one of these if then god so clothe the grass which is to day in the fieldand to morrow is cast into the oven how much more will he clothe youo ye of little faith   and seek not ye what ye shall eat orwhat ye shall drink neither be ye of doubtful mind for all these things do the nations of the world seek after andyour father knoweth that ye have need of these things but rather seek ye the kingdom of god and all these thingsshall be added unto you fear not little flock for it is your fathers good pleasure togive you the kingdom sell that ye have and give alms provide yourselves bags whichwax not old a treasure in the heavens that faileth not where nothief approacheth neither moth corrupteth for where your treasure is there will your heart be also let your loins be girded about and your lights burning and ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord when he willreturn from the wedding that when he cometh and knocketh they mayopen unto him immediately blessed are those servants whom the lord when he cometh shallfind watching verily i say unto you that he shall gird himself andmake them to sit down to meat and will come forth and serve them and if he shall come in the second watch or come in the thirdwatch and find them so blessed are those servants and this know that if the goodman of the house had known whathour the thief would come he would have watched and not havesuffered his house to be broken through be ye therefore ready also for the son of man cometh at an hourwhen ye think not then peter said unto him lord speakest thou this parable untous or even to all   and the lord said who then is thatfaithful and wise steward whom his lord shall make ruler over hishousehold to give them their portion of meat in due season  blessed is that servant whom his lord when he cometh shall find sodoing of a truth i say unto you that he will make him ruler over allthat he hath but and if that servant say in his heart my lord delayeth hiscoming and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens and toeat and drink and to be drunken  the lord of that servant willcome in a day when he looketh not for him and at an hour when he isnot aware and will cut him in sunder and will appoint him hisportion with the unbelievers and that servant which knew his lords will and prepared nothimself neither did according to his will shall be beaten with manystripes but he that knew not and did commit things worthy of stripesshall be beaten with few stripes for unto whomsoever much is givenof him shall be much required and to whom men have committed much ofhim they will ask the more i am come to send fire on the earth and what will i if it bealready kindled   but i have a baptism to be baptized with andhow am i straitened till it be accomplished   suppose ye that iam come to give peace on earth i tell you nay but rather division for from henceforth there shall be five in one house dividedthree against two and two against three the father shall be divided against the son and the son againstthe father the mother against the daughter and the daughter againstthe mother the mother in law against her daughter in law and thedaughter in law against her mother in law and he said also to the people when ye see a cloud rise out ofthe west straightway ye say there cometh a shower and so it is and when ye see the south wind blow ye say there will be heatand it cometh to pass ye hypocrites ye can discern the face of the sky and of theearth but how is it that ye do not discern this time   yea andwhy even of yourselves judge ye not what is right   when thougoest with thine adversary to the magistrate as thou art in the waygive diligence that thou mayest be delivered from him lest he halethee to the judge and the judge deliver thee to the officer and theofficer cast thee into prison i tell thee thou shalt not depart thence till thou hast paidthe very last mite there were present at that season some that told him of thegalilaeans whose blood pilate had mingled with their sacrifices and jesus answering said unto them suppose ye that thesegalilaeans were sinners above all the galilaeans because theysuffered such things   i tell you nay but except ye repent yeshall all likewise perish or those eighteen upon whom the tower in siloam fell and slewthem think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt injerusalem   i tell you nay but except ye repent ye shall alllikewise perish he spake also this parable a certain man had a fig tree plantedin his vineyard and he came and sought fruit thereon and found none then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard behold thesethree years i come seeking fruit on this fig tree and find none cutit down why cumbereth it the ground   and he answering said untohim lord let it alone this year also till i shall dig about it anddung it  and if it bear fruit well and if not then after thatthou shalt cut it down and he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath and behold there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmityeighteen years and was bowed together and could in no wise lift upherself and when jesus saw her he called her to him and said unto herwoman thou art loosed from thine infirmity and he laid his hands on her and immediately she was madestraight and glorified god and the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignationbecause that jesus had healed on the sabbath day and said unto thepeople there are six days in which men ought to work in themtherefore come and be healed and not on the sabbath day the lord then answered him and said thou hypocrite doth noteach one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stalland lead him away to watering   and ought not this woman beinga daughter of abraham whom satan hath bound lo these eighteenyears be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day   and when hehad said these things all his adversaries were ashamed and all thepeople rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him then said he unto what is the kingdom of god like andwhereunto shall i resemble it   it is like a grain of mustardseed which a man took and cast into his garden and it grew andwaxed a great tree and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches ofit and again he said whereunto shall i liken the kingdom of god it is like leaven which a woman took and hid in three measuresof meal till the whole was leavened and he went through the cities and villages teaching andjourneying toward jerusalem then said one unto him lord are there few that be saved andhe said unto them  strive to enter in at the strait gate formany i say unto you will seek to enter in and shall not be able when once the master of the house is risen up and hath shut tothe door and ye begin to stand without and to knock at the doorsaying lord lord open unto us and he shall answer and say untoyou i know you not whence ye are  then shall ye begin to saywe have eaten and drunk in thy presence and thou hast taught in ourstreets but he shall say i tell you i know you not whence ye aredepart from me all ye workers of iniquity there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth when ye shall seeabraham and isaac and jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom ofgod and you yourselves thrust out and they shall come from the east and from the west and fromthe north and from the south and shall sit down in the kingdom ofgod and behold there are last which shall be first and there arefirst which shall be last the same day there came certain of the pharisees saying untohim get thee out and depart hence for herod will kill thee and he said unto them go ye and tell that fox behold i castout devils and i do cures to day and to morrow and the third day ishall be perfected nevertheless i must walk to day and to morrow and the dayfollowing for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of jerusalem o jerusalem jerusalem which killest the prophets and stonestthem that are sent unto thee how often would i have gathered thychildren together as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings andye would not   behold your house is left unto you desolate andverily i say unto you ye shall not see me until the time come whenye shall say blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord and it came to pass as he went into the house of one of thechief pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day that they watchedhim and behold there was a certain man before him which had thedropsy and jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and pharisees sayingis it lawful to heal on the sabbath day   and they held theirpeace and he took him and healed him and let him go  andanswered them saying which of you shall have an ass or an ox falleninto a pit and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day and they could not answer him again to these things and he put forth a parable to those which were bidden when hemarked how they chose out the chief rooms saying unto them when thou art bidden of any man to a wedding sit not down in thehighest room lest a more honourable man than thou be bidden of him and he that bade thee and him come and say to thee give this manplace and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room but when thou art bidden go and sit down in the lowest roomthat when he that bade thee cometh he may say unto thee friend goup higher then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them thatsit at meat with thee for whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased and he thathumbleth himself shall be exalted then said he also to him that bade him when thou makest adinner or a supper call not thy friends nor thy brethren neitherthy kinsmen nor thy rich neighbours lest they also bid thee againand a recompence be made thee but when thou makest a feast call the poor the maimed thelame the blind  and thou shalt be blessed for they cannotrecompense thee for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection ofthe just and when one of them that sat at meat with him heard thesethings he said unto him blessed is he that shall eat bread in thekingdom of god then said he unto him a certain man made a great supper andbade many  and sent his servant at supper time to say to themthat were bidden come for all things are now ready and they all with one consent began to make excuse the firstsaid unto him i have bought a piece of ground and i must needs goand see it i pray thee have me excused and another said i have bought five yoke of oxen and i go toprove them i pray thee have me excused and another said i have married a wife and therefore i cannotcome so that servant came and shewed his lord these things then themaster of the house being angry said to his servant go out quicklyinto the streets and lanes of the city and bring in hither the poorand the maimed and the halt and the blind and the servant said lord it is done as thou hast commandedand yet there is room and the lord said unto the servant go out into the highways andhedges and compel them to come in that my house may be filled for i say unto you that none of those men which were biddenshall taste of my supper and there went great multitudes with him and he turned andsaid unto them  if any man come to me and hate not his fatherand mother and wife and children and brethren and sisters yeaand his own life also he cannot be my disciple and whosoever doth not bear his cross and come after me cannotbe my disciple for which of you intending to build a tower sitteth not downfirst and counteth the cost whether he have sufficient to finish it lest haply after he hath laid the foundation and is not ableto finish it all that behold it begin to mock him  saying thisman began to build and was not able to finish or what king going to make war against another king sittethnot down first and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand tomeet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand   or elsewhile the other is yet a great way off he sendeth an ambassage anddesireth conditions of peace so likewise whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all thathe hath he cannot be my disciple salt is good but if the salt have lost his savour wherewithshall it be seasoned   it is neither fit for the land nor yetfor the dunghill but men cast it out he that hath ears to hear lethim hear then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hearhim and the pharisees and scribes murmured saying this manreceiveth sinners and eateth with them and he spake this parable unto them saying  what man ofyou having an hundred sheep if he lose one of them doth not leavethe ninety and nine in the wilderness and go after that which islost until he find it   and when he hath found it he layeth iton his shoulders rejoicing and when he cometh home he calleth together his friends andneighbours saying unto them rejoice with me for i have found mysheep which was lost i say unto you that likewise joy shall be in heaven over onesinner that repenteth more than over ninety and nine just personswhich need no repentance either what woman having ten pieces of silver if she lose onepiece doth not light a candle and sweep the house and seekdiligently till she find it   and when she hath found it shecalleth her friends and her neighbours together saying rejoice withme for i have found the piece which i had lost likewise i say unto you there is joy in the presence of theangels of god over one sinner that repenteth and he said a certain man had two sons  and the youngerof them said to his father father give me the portion of goods thatfalleth to me and he divided unto them his living and not many days after the younger son gathered all togetherand took his journey into a far country and there wasted hissubstance with riotous living and when he had spent all there arose a mighty famine in thatland and he began to be in want and he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country andhe sent him into his fields to feed swine and he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that theswine did eat and no man gave unto him and when he came to himself he said how many hired servants ofmy fathers have bread enough and to spare and i perish with hunger i will arise and go to my father and will say unto him fatheri have sinned against heaven and before thee  and am no moreworthy to be called thy son make me as one of thy hired servants and he arose and came to his father but when he was yet agreat way off his father saw him and had compassion and ran andfell on his neck and kissed him and the son said unto him father i have sinned against heavenand in thy sight and am no more worthy to be called thy son but the father said to his servants bring forth the best robeand put it on him and put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet and bring hither the fatted calf and kill it and let us eatand be merry  for this my son was dead and is alive again hewas lost and is found and they began to be merry now his elder son was in the field and as he came and drew nighto the house he heard musick and dancing and he called one of the servants and asked what these thingsmeant and he said unto him thy brother is come and thy father hathkilled the fatted calf because he hath received him safe and sound and he was angry and would not go in therefore came his fatherout and intreated him and he answering said to his father lo these many years do iserve thee neither transgressed i at any time thy commandment andyet thou never gavest me a kid that i might make merry with myfriends  but as soon as this thy son was come which hathdevoured thy living with harlots thou hast killed for him the fattedcalf and he said unto him son thou art ever with me and all that ihave is thine it was meet that we should make merry and be glad for this thybrother was dead and is alive again and was lost and is found and he said also unto his disciples there was a certain richman which had a steward and the same was accused unto him that hehad wasted his goods and he called him and said unto him how is it that i hear thisof thee give an account of thy stewardship for thou mayest be nolonger steward then the steward said within himself what shall i do for mylord taketh away from me the stewardship i cannot dig to beg i amashamed i am resolved what to do that when i am put out of thestewardship they may receive me into their houses so he called every one of his lords debtors unto him and saidunto the first how much owest thou unto my lord   and he saidan hundred measures of oil and he said unto him take thy bill andsit down quickly and write fifty then said he to another and how much owest thou and he said anhundred measures of wheat and he said unto him take thy bill andwrite fourscore and the lord commended the unjust steward because he had donewisely for the children of this world are in their generation wiserthan the children of light and i say unto you make to yourselves friends of the mammon ofunrighteousness that when ye fail they may receive you intoeverlasting habitations he that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also inmuch and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much if therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteousmammon who will commit to your trust the true riches   and ifye have not been faithful in that which is another mans who shallgive you that which is your own   no servant can serve twomasters for either he will hate the one and love the other or elsehe will hold to the one and despise the other ye cannot serve godand mammon and the pharisees also who were covetous heard all thesethings and they derided him and he said unto them ye are they which justify yourselvesbefore men but god knoweth your hearts for that which is highlyesteemed among men is abomination in the sight of god the law and the prophets were until john since that time thekingdom of god is preached and every man presseth into it and it is easier for heaven and earth to pass than one tittleof the law to fail whosoever putteth away his wife and marrieth anothercommitteth adultery and whosoever marrieth her that is put away fromher husband committeth adultery there was a certain rich man which was clothed in purple andfine linen and fared sumptuously every day  and there was acertain beggar named lazarus which was laid at his gate full ofsores  and desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell fromthe rich mans table moreover the dogs came and licked his sores and it came to pass that the beggar died and was carried bythe angels into abrahams bosom the rich man also died and wasburied  and in hell he lift up his eyes being in torments andseeth abraham afar off and lazarus in his bosom and he cried and said father abraham have mercy on me andsend lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and coolmy tongue for i am tormented in this flame but abraham said son remember that thou in thy lifetimereceivedst thy good things and likewise lazarus evil things but nowhe is comforted and thou art tormented and beside all this between us and you there is a great gulffixed so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot neithercan they pass to us that would come from thence then he said i pray thee therefore father that thou wouldestsend him to my fathers house  for i have five brethren that hemay testify unto them lest they also come into this place of torment abraham saith unto him they have moses and the prophets letthem hear them and he said nay father abraham but if one went unto them fromthe dead they will repent and he said unto him if they hear not moses and the prophetsneither will they be persuaded though one rose from the dead then said he unto the disciples it is impossible but thatoffences will come but woe unto him through whom they come   itwere better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck andhe cast into the sea than that he should offend one of these littleones take heed to yourselves if thy brother trespass against theerebuke him and if he repent forgive him and if he trespass against thee seven times in a day and seventimes in a day turn again to thee saying i repent thou shaltforgive him and the apostles said unto the lord increase our faith and the lord said if ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed yemight say unto this sycamine tree be thou plucked up by the root andbe thou planted in the sea and it should obey you but which of you having a servant plowing or feeding cattlewill say unto him by and by when he is come from the field go andsit down to meat   and will not rather say unto him make readywherewith i may sup and gird thyself and serve me till i have eatenand drunken and afterward thou shalt eat and drink   doth hethank that servant because he did the things that were commanded himi trow not so likewise ye when ye shall have done all those things whichare commanded you say we are unprofitable servants we have donethat which was our duty to do and it came to pass as he went to jerusalem that he passedthrough the midst of samaria and galilee and as he entered into a certain village there met him ten menthat were lepers which stood afar off  and they lifted up theirvoices and said jesus master have mercy on us and when he saw them he said unto them go shew yourselves untothe priests and it came to pass that as they went they werecleansed and one of them when he saw that he was healed turned backand with a loud voice glorified god  and fell down on his faceat his feet giving him thanks and he was a samaritan and jesus answering said were there not ten cleansed but whereare the nine   there are not found that returned to give gloryto god save this stranger and he said unto him arise go thy way thy faith hath madethee whole and when he was demanded of the pharisees when the kingdom ofgod should come he answered them and said the kingdom of god comethnot with observation  neither shall they say lo here or lothere for behold the kingdom of god is within you and he said unto the disciples the days will come when yeshall desire to see one of the days of the son of man and ye shallnot see it and they shall say to you see here or see there go not afterthem nor follow them for as the lightning that lighteneth out of the one part underheaven shineth unto the other part under heaven so shall also theson of man be in his day but first must he suffer many things and be rejected of thisgeneration and as it was in the days of noe so shall it be also in thedays of the son of man they did eat they drank they married wives they were given inmarriage until the day that noe entered into the ark and the floodcame and destroyed them all likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat theydrank they bought they sold they planted they builded  butthe same day that lot went out of sodom it rained fire and brimstonefrom heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man isrevealed in that day he which shall be upon the housetop and his stuffin the house let him not come down to take it away and he that is inthe field let him likewise not return back remember lots wife whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it andwhosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it i tell you in that night there shall be two men in one bed theone shall be taken and the other shall be left two women shall be grinding together the one shall be takenand the other left two men shall be in the field the one shall be taken and theother left and they answered and said unto him where lord and he saidunto them wheresoever the body is thither will the eagles begathered together and he spake a parable unto them to this end that men oughtalways to pray and not to faint  saying there was in a city ajudge which feared not god neither regarded man  and there wasa widow in that city and she came unto him saying avenge me of mineadversary and he would not for a while but afterward he said withinhimself though i fear not god nor regard man  yet because thiswidow troubleth me i will avenge her lest by her continual comingshe weary me and the lord said hear what the unjust judge saith and shall not god avenge his own elect which cry day and nightunto him though he bear long with them   i tell you that he willavenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh shallhe find faith on the earth   and he spake this parable untocertain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous anddespised others  two men went up into the temple to pray theone a pharisee and the other a publican the pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself god i thankthee that i am not as other men are extortioners unjustadulterers or even as this publican i fast twice in the week i give tithes of all that i possess and the publican standing afar off would not lift up so muchas his eyes unto heaven but smote upon his breast saying god bemerciful to me a sinner i tell you this man went down to his house justified ratherthan the other for every one that exalteth himself shall be abasedand he that humbleth himself shall be exalted and they brought unto him also infants that he would touchthem but when his disciples saw it they rebuked them but jesus called them unto him and said suffer little childrento come unto me and forbid them not for of such is the kingdom ofgod verily i say unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingdomof god as a little child shall in no wise enter therein and a certain ruler asked him saying good master what shall ido to inherit eternal life   and jesus said unto him whycallest thou me good none is good save one that is god thou knowest the commandments do not commit adultery do notkill do not steal do not bear false witness honour thy father andthy mother and he said all these have i kept from my youth up now when jesus heard these things he said unto him yet lackestthou one thing sell all that thou hast and distribute unto the poorand thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come follow me and when he heard this he was very sorrowful for he was veryrich and when jesus saw that he was very sorrowful he said howhardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of god for it is easier for a camel to go through a needles eye thanfor a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god and they that heard it said who then can be saved   andhe said the things which are impossible with men are possible withgod then peter said lo we have left all and followed thee and he said unto them verily i say unto you there is no manthat hath left house or parents or brethren or wife or childrenfor the kingdom of gods sake  who shall not receive manifoldmore in this present time and in the world to come life everlasting then he took unto him the twelve and said unto them behold wego up to jerusalem and all things that are written by the prophetsconcerning the son of man shall be accomplished for he shall be delivered unto the gentiles and shall bemocked and spitefully entreated and spitted on  and they shallscourge him and put him to death and the third day he shall riseagain and they understood none of these things and this saying washid from them neither knew they the things which were spoken and it came to pass that as he was come nigh unto jericho acertain blind man sat by the way side begging  and hearing themultitude pass by he asked what it meant and they told him that jesus of nazareth passeth by and he cried saying jesus thou son of david have mercy onme and they which went before rebuked him that he should hold hispeace but he cried so much the more thou son of david have mercy onme and jesus stood and commanded him to be brought unto him andwhen he was come near he asked him  saying what wilt thou thati shall do unto thee and he said lord that i may receive my sight and jesus said unto him receive thy sight thy faith hath savedthee and immediately he received his sight and followed himglorifying god and all the people when they saw it gave praise untogod and jesus entered and passed through jericho and behold there was a man named zacchaeus which was the chiefamong the publicans and he was rich and he sought to see jesus who he was and could not for thepress because he was little of stature and he ran before and climbed up into a sycomore tree to seehim for he was to pass that way and when jesus came to the place he looked up and saw him andsaid unto him zacchaeus make haste and come down for to day i mustabide at thy house and he made haste and came down and received him joyfully and when they saw it they all murmured saying that he was goneto be guest with a man that is a sinner and zacchaeus stood and said unto the lord behold lord thehalf of my goods i give to the poor and if i have taken any thingfrom any man by false accusation i restore him fourfold and jesus said unto him this day is salvation come to thishouse forsomuch as he also is a son of abraham for the son of man is come to seek and to save that which waslost and as they heard these things he added and spake a parablebecause he was nigh to jerusalem and because they thought that thekingdom of god should immediately appear he said therefore a certain nobleman went into a far country toreceive for himself a kingdom and to return and he called his ten servants and delivered them ten poundsand said unto them occupy till i come but his citizens hated him and sent a message after himsaying we will not have this man to reign over us and it came to pass that when he was returned having receivedthe kingdom then he commanded these servants to be called unto himto whom he had given the money that he might know how much every manhad gained by trading then came the first saying lord thy pound hath gained tenpounds and he said unto him well thou good servant because thou hastbeen faithful in a very little have thou authority over ten cities and the second came saying lord thy pound hath gained fivepounds and he said likewise to him be thou also over five cities and another came saying lord behold here is thy pound whichi have kept laid up in a napkin  for i feared thee because thouart an austere man thou takest up that thou layedst not down andreapest that thou didst not sow and he saith unto him out of thine own mouth will i judge theethou wicked servant thou knewest that i was an austere man taking upthat i laid not down and reaping that i did not sow  whereforethen gavest not thou my money into the bank that at my coming i mighthave required mine own with usury   and he said unto them thatstood by take from him the pound and give it to him that hath tenpounds and they said unto him lord he hath ten pounds   for isay unto you that unto every one which hath shall be given and fromhim that hath not even that he hath shall be taken away from him but those mine enemies which would not that i should reign overthem bring hither and slay them before me and when he had thus spoken he went before ascending up tojerusalem and it came to pass when he was come nigh to bethphage andbethany at the mount called the mount of olives he sent two of hisdisciples  saying go ye into the village over against you inthe which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied whereon yetnever man sat loose him and bring him hither and if any man ask you why do ye loose him thus shall ye sayunto him because the lord hath need of him and they that were sent went their way and found even as he hadsaid unto them and as they were loosing the colt the owners thereof said untothem why loose ye the colt   and they said the lord hath needof him and they brought him to jesus and they cast their garments uponthe colt and they set jesus thereon and as he went they spread their clothes in the way and when he was come nigh even now at the descent of the mountof olives the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice andpraise god with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they hadseen  saying blessed be the king that cometh in the name of thelord peace in heaven and glory in the highest and some of the pharisees from among the multitude said untohim master rebuke thy disciples and he answered and said unto them i tell you that if theseshould hold their peace the stones would immediately cry out and when he was come near he beheld the city and wept over it saying if thou hadst known even thou at least in this thyday the things which belong unto thy peace but now they are hid fromthine eyes for the days shall come upon thee that thine enemies shall casta trench about thee and compass thee round and keep thee in on everyside  and shall lay thee even with the ground and thy childrenwithin thee and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon anotherbecause thou knewest not the time of thy visitation and he went into the temple and began to cast out them thatsold therein and them that bought  saying unto them it iswritten my house is the house of prayer but ye have made it a den ofthieves and he taught daily in the temple but the chief priests and thescribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him  andcould not find what they might do for all the people were veryattentive to hear him and it came to pass that on one of those days as he taught thepeople in the temple and preached the gospel the chief priests andthe scribes came upon him with the elders  and spake unto himsaying tell us by what authority doest thou these things or who ishe that gave thee this authority   and he answered and said untothem i will also ask you one thing and answer me  the baptismof john was it from heaven or of men   and they reasoned withthemselves saying if we shall say from heaven he will say whythen believed ye him not   but and if we say of men all thepeople will stone us for they be persuaded that john was a prophet and they answered that they could not tell whence it was and jesus said unto them neither tell i you by what authority ido these things then began he to speak to the people this parable a certain manplanted a vineyard and let it forth to husbandmen and went into afar country for a long time and at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen that theyshould give him of the fruit of the vineyard but the husbandmen beathim and sent him away empty and again he sent another servant and they beat him also andentreated him shamefully and sent him away empty and again he sent a third and they wounded him also and casthim out then said the lord of the vineyard what shall i do i will sendmy beloved son it may be they will reverence him when they see him but when the husbandmen saw him they reasoned among themselvessaying this is the heir come let us kill him that the inheritancemay be ours so they cast him out of the vineyard and killed him whattherefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them   he shallcome and destroy these husbandmen and shall give the vineyard toothers and when they heard it they said god forbid and he beheld them and said what is this then that is writtenthe stone which the builders rejected the same is become the head ofthe corner   whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall bebroken but on whomsoever it shall fall it will grind him to powder and the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought tolay hands on him and they feared the people for they perceived thathe had spoken this parable against them and they watched him and sent forth spies which should feignthemselves just men that they might take hold of his words that sothey might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor and they asked him saying master we know that thou sayest andteachest rightly neither acceptest thou the person of any butteachest the way of god truly  is it lawful for us to givetribute unto caesar or no   but he perceived their craftinessand said unto them why tempt ye me   shew me a penny whoseimage and superscription hath it they answered and said caesars and he said unto them render therefore unto caesar the thingswhich be caesars and unto god the things which be gods and they could not take hold of his words before the people andthey marvelled at his answer and held their peace then came to him certain of the sadducees which deny that thereis any resurrection and they asked him  saying master moseswrote unto us if any mans brother die having a wife and he diewithout children that his brother should take his wife and raise upseed unto his brother there were therefore seven brethren and the first took a wifeand died without children and the second took her to wife and he died childless and the third took her and in like manner the seven also andthey left no children and died last of all the woman died also therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she forseven had her to wife and jesus answering said unto them the children of this worldmarry and are given in marriage  but they which shall beaccounted worthy to obtain that world and the resurrection from thedead neither marry nor are given in marriage  neither can theydie any more for they are equal unto the angels and are the childrenof god being the children of the resurrection now that the dead are raised even moses shewed at the bushwhen he calleth the lord the god of abraham and the god of isaac andthe god of jacob for he is not a god of the dead but of the living for all liveunto him then certain of the scribes answering said master thou hastwell said and after that they durst not ask him any question at all and he said unto them how say they that christ is davids son and david himself saith in the book of psalms the lord saidunto my lord sit thou on my right hand  till i make thineenemies thy footstool david therefore calleth him lord how is he then his son  then in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples beware of the scribes which desire to walk in long robes andlove greetings in the markets and the highest seats in thesynagogues and the chief rooms at feasts  which devour widowshouses and for a shew make long prayers the same shall receivegreater damnation and he looked up and saw the rich men casting their gifts intothe treasury and he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither twomites and he said of a truth i say unto you that this poor widow hathcast in more than they all  for all these have of their abundancecast in unto the offerings of god but she of her penury hath cast inall the living that she had and as some spake of the temple how it was adorned with goodlystones and gifts he said  as for these things which ye beholdthe days will come in the which there shall not be left one stoneupon another that shall not be thrown down and they asked him saying master but when shall these thingsbe  and what sign will there be when these things shall come to pass and he said take heed that ye be not deceived for many shallcome in my name saying i am christ and the time draweth near go yenot therefore after them but when ye shall hear of wars and commotions be not terrifiedfor these things must first come to pass but the end is not by andby then said he unto them nation shall rise against nation andkingdom against kingdom  and great earthquakes shall be indivers places and famines and pestilences and fearful sights andgreat signs shall there be from heaven but before all these they shall lay their hands on you andpersecute you delivering you up to the synagogues and into prisonsbeing brought before kings and rulers for my names sake and it shall turn to you for a testimony settle it therefore in your hearts not to meditate before whatye shall answer  for i will give you a mouth and wisdom whichall your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist and ye shall be betrayed both by parents and brethren andkinsfolks and friends and some of you shall they cause to be put todeath and ye shall be hated of all men for my names sake but there shall not an hair of your head perish in your patience possess ye your souls and when ye shall see jerusalem compassed with armies then knowthat the desolation thereof is nigh then let them which are in judaea flee to the mountains and letthem which are in the midst of it depart out and let not them thatare in the countries enter thereinto for these be the days of vengeance that all things which arewritten may be fulfilled but woe unto them that are with child and to them that givesuck in those days for there shall be great distress in the landand wrath upon this people and they shall fall by the edge of the sword and shall be ledaway captive into all nations and jerusalem shall be trodden down ofthe gentiles until the times of the gentiles be fulfilled and there shall be signs in the sun and in the moon and in thestars and upon the earth distress of nations with perplexity thesea and the waves roaring  mens hearts failing them for fearand for looking after those things which are coming on the earth forthe powers of heaven shall be shaken and then shall they see the son of man coming in a cloud withpower and great glory and when these things begin to come to pass then look up andlift up your heads for your redemption draweth nigh and he spake to them a parable behold the fig tree and all thetrees  when they now shoot forth ye see and know of your ownselves that summer is now nigh at hand so likewise ye when ye see these things come to pass know yethat the kingdom of god is nigh at hand verily i say unto you this generation shall not pass away tillall be fulfilled heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not passaway and take heed to yourselves lest at any time your hearts beovercharged with surfeiting and drunkenness and cares of this lifeand so that day come upon you unawares for as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the faceof the whole earth watch ye therefore and pray always that ye may be accountedworthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass and tostand before the son of man and in the day time he was teaching in the temple and at nighthe went out and abode in the mount that is called the mount ofolives and all the people came early in the morning to him in thetemple for to hear him now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh which is called thepassover and the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill himfor they feared the people then entered satan into judas surnamed iscariot being of thenumber of the twelve and he went his way and communed with the chief priests andcaptains how he might betray him unto them and they were glad and covenanted to give him money and he promised and sought opportunity to betray him unto themin the absence of the multitude then came the day of unleavened bread when the passover must bekilled and he sent peter and john saying go and prepare us thepassover that we may eat and they said unto him where wilt thou that we prepare  and he said unto them behold when ye are entered into the citythere shall a man meet you bearing a pitcher of water follow himinto the house where he entereth in and ye shall say unto the goodman of the house the master saithunto thee where is the guestchamber where i shall eat the passoverwith my disciples   and he shall shew you a large upper roomfurnished there make ready and they went and found as he had said unto them and they madeready the passover and when the hour was come he sat down and the twelve apostleswith him and he said unto them with desire i have desired to eat thispassover with you before i suffer  for i say unto you i willnot any more eat thereof until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of god and he took the cup and gave thanks and said take this anddivide it among yourselves  for i say unto you i will not drinkof the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of god shall come and he took bread and gave thanks and brake it and gave untothem saying this is my body which is given for you this do inremembrance of me likewise also the cup after supper saying this cup is the newtestament in my blood which is shed for you but behold the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on thetable and truly the son of man goeth as it was determined but woeunto that man by whom he is betrayed   and they began to enquireamong themselves which of them it was that should do this thing and there was also a strife among them which of them should beaccounted the greatest and he said unto them the kings of the gentiles exerciselordship over them and they that exercise authority upon them arecalled benefactors but ye shall not be so but he that is greatest among you lethim be as the younger and he that is chief as he that doth serve for whether is greater he that sitteth at meat or he thatserveth  is not he that sitteth at meat but i am among you as hethat serveth ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations and i appoint unto you a kingdom as my father hath appointedunto me  that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdomand sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of israel and the lord said simon simon behold satan hath desired tohave you that he may sift you as wheat  but i have prayed forthee that thy faith fail not and when thou art converted strengthenthy brethren and he said unto him lord i am ready to go with thee bothinto prison and to death and he said i tell thee peter the cock shall not crow thisday before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me and he said unto them when i sent you without purse and scripand shoes lacked ye any thing and they said nothing then said he unto them but now he that hath a purse let himtake it and likewise his scrip and he that hath no sword let himsell his garment and buy one for i say unto you that this that is written must yet beaccomplished in me and he was reckoned among the transgressors forthe things concerning me have an end and they said lord behold here are two swords and he saidunto them it is enough and he came out and went as he was wont to the mount ofolives and his disciples also followed him and when he was at the place he said unto them pray that yeenter not into temptation and he was withdrawn from them about a stones cast and kneeleddown and prayed  saying father if thou be willing removethis cup from me nevertheless not my will but thine be done and there appeared an angel unto him from heaven strengtheninghim and being in an agony he prayed more earnestly and his sweatwas as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground and when he rose up from prayer and was come to his discipleshe found them sleeping for sorrow  and said unto them why sleepye rise and pray lest ye enter into temptation and while he yet spake behold a multitude and he that wascalled judas one of the twelve went before them and drew near untojesus to kiss him but jesus said unto him judas betrayest thou the son of manwith a kiss   when they which were about him saw what wouldfollow they said unto him lord shall we smite with the sword and one of them smote the servant of the high priest and cutoff his right ear and jesus answered and said suffer ye thus far and he touchedhis ear and healed him then jesus said unto the chief priests and captains of thetemple and the elders which were come to him be ye come out asagainst a thief with swords and staves   when i was daily withyou in the temple ye stretched forth no hands against me but this isyour hour and the power of darkness then took they him and led him and brought him into the highpriests house and peter followed afar off and when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall andwere set down together peter sat down among them but a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire andearnestly looked upon him and said this man was also with him and he denied him saying woman i know him not and after a little while another saw him and said thou artalso of them and peter said man i am not and about the space of one hour after another confidentlyaffirmed saying of a truth this fellow also was with him for he isa galilaean and peter said man i know not what thou sayest andimmediately while he yet spake the cock crew and the lord turned and looked upon peter and peter rememberedthe word of the lord how he had said unto him before the cock crowthou shalt deny me thrice and peter went out and wept bitterly and the men that held jesus mocked him and smote him and when they had blindfolded him they struck him on the faceand asked him saying prophesy who is it that smote thee   andmany other things blasphemously spake they against him and as soon as it was day the elders of the people and thechief priests and the scribes came together and led him into theircouncil saying  art thou the christ tell us and he said untothem if i tell you ye will not believe  and if i also ask youye will not answer me nor let me go hereafter shall the son of man sit on the right hand of thepower of god then said they all art thou then the son of god and he saidunto them ye say that i am and they said what need we any further witness for weourselves have heard of his own mouth and the whole multitude of them arose and led him unto pilate and they began to accuse him saying we found this fellowperverting the nation and forbidding to give tribute to caesarsaying that he himself is christ a king and pilate asked him saying art thou the king of the jews andhe answered him and said thou sayest it then said pilate to the chief priests and to the people i findno fault in this man and they were the more fierce saying he stirreth up the peopleteaching throughout all jewry beginning from galilee to this place when pilate heard of galilee he asked whether the man were agalilaean and as soon as he knew that he belonged unto herodsjurisdiction he sent him to herod who himself also was at jerusalemat that time and when herod saw jesus he was exceeding glad for he wasdesirous to see him of a long season because he had heard many thingsof him and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him then he questioned with him in many words but he answered himnothing and the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accusedhim and herod with his men of war set him at nought and mocked himand arrayed him in a gorgeous robe and sent him again to pilate and the same day pilate and herod were made friends togetherfor before they were at enmity between themselves and pilate when he had called together the chief priests andthe rulers and the people  said unto them ye have brought thisman unto me as one that perverteth the people and behold i havingexamined him before you have found no fault in this man touchingthose things whereof ye accuse him  no nor yet herod for isent you to him and lo nothing worthy of death is done unto him i will therefore chastise him and release him for of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast and they cried out all at once saying away with this man andrelease unto us barabbas  who for a certain sedition made inthe city and for murder was cast into prison   pilatetherefore willing to release jesus spake again to them but they cried saying crucify him crucify him and he said unto them the third time why what evil hath hedone i have found no cause of death in him i will therefore chastisehim and let him go and they were instant with loud voices requiring that he mightbe crucified and the voices of them and of the chief priestsprevailed and pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required and he released unto them him that for sedition and murder wascast into prison whom they had desired but he delivered jesus totheir will and as they led him away they laid hold upon one simon acyrenian coming out of the country and on him they laid the crossthat he might bear it after jesus and there followed him a great company of people and of womenwhich also bewailed and lamented him but jesus turning unto them said daughters of jerusalem weepnot for me but weep for yourselves and for your children for behold the days are coming in the which they shall sayblessed are the barren and the wombs that never bare and the papswhich never gave suck then shall they begin to say to the mountains fall on us andto the hills cover us for if they do these things in a green tree what shall be donein the dry   and there were also two other malefactors ledwith him to be put to death and when they were come to the place which is called calvarythere they crucified him and the malefactors one on the right handand the other on the left then said jesus father forgive them for they know not whatthey do and they parted his raiment and cast lots and the people stood beholding and the rulers also with themderided him saying he saved others let him save himself if he bechrist the chosen of god and the soldiers also mocked him coming to him and offeringhim vinegar  and saying if thou be the king of the jews savethyself and a superscription also was written over him in letters ofgreek and latin and hebrew this is the king of the jews and one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on himsaying if thou be christ save thyself and us but the other answering rebuked him saying dost not thou feargod seeing thou art in the same condemnation   and we indeedjustly for we receive the due reward of our deeds but this man hathdone nothing amiss and he said unto jesus lord remember me when thou comest intothy kingdom and jesus said unto him verily i say unto thee to day shaltthou be with me in paradise and it was about the sixth hour and there was a darkness overall the earth until the ninth hour and the sun was darkened and the veil of the temple was rent inthe midst and when jesus had cried with a loud voice he said fatherinto thy hands i commend my spirit and having said thus he gave upthe ghost now when the centurion saw what was done he glorified godsaying certainly this was a righteous man and all the people that came together to that sight beholdingthe things which were done smote their breasts and returned and all his acquaintance and the women that followed him fromgalilee stood afar off beholding these things and behold there was a man named joseph a counsellor and hewas a good man and a just  the same had not consented to thecounsel and deed of them he was of arimathaea a city of the jewswho also himself waited for the kingdom of god this man went unto pilate and begged the body of jesus and he took it down and wrapped it in linen and laid it in asepulchre that was hewn in stone wherein never man before was laid and that day was the preparation and the sabbath drew on and the women also which came with him from galilee followedafter and beheld the sepulchre and how his body was laid and they returned and prepared spices and ointments and restedthe sabbath day according to the commandment now upon the first day of the week very early in the morningthey came unto the sepulchre bringing the spices which they hadprepared and certain others with them and they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre and they entered in and found not the body of the lord jesus and it came to pass as they were much perplexed thereaboutbehold two men stood by them in shining garments  and as theywere afraid and bowed down their faces to the earth they said untothem why seek ye the living among the dead   he is not here butis risen remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in galilee saying the son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinfulmen and be crucified and the third day rise again and they remembered his words  and returned from thesepulchre and told all these things unto the eleven and to all therest it was mary magdalene and joanna and mary the mother of jamesand other women that were with them which told these things unto theapostles and their words seemed to them as idle tales and they believedthem not then arose peter and ran unto the sepulchre and stooping downhe beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves and departedwondering in himself at that which was come to pass and behold two of them went that same day to a village calledemmaus which was from jerusalem about threescore furlongs and they talked together of all these things which had happened and it came to pass that while they communed together andreasoned jesus himself drew near and went with them but their eyes were holden that they should not know him and he said unto them what manner of communications are thesethat ye have one to another as ye walk and are sad   and theone of them whose name was cleopas answering said unto him art thouonly a stranger in jerusalem and hast not known the things which arecome to pass there in these days   and he said unto them whatthings and they said unto him concerning jesus of nazareth whichwas a prophet mighty in deed and word before god and all the people and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to becondemned to death and have crucified him but we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemedisrael and beside all this to day is the third day since thesethings were done yea and certain women also of our company made us astonishedwhich were early at the sepulchre  and when they found not hisbody they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angelswhich said that he was alive and certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchreand found it even so as the women had said but him they saw not then he said unto them o fools and slow of heart to believeall that the prophets have spoken  ought not christ to havesuffered these things and to enter into his glory   andbeginning at moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them in allthe scriptures the things concerning himself and they drew nigh unto the village whither they went and hemade as though he would have gone further but they constrained him saying abide with us for it istoward evening and the day is far spent and he went in to tarry withthem and it came to pass as he sat at meat with them he took breadand blessed it and brake and gave to them and their eyes were opened and they knew him and he vanishedout of their sight and they said one to another did not our heart burn within uswhile he talked with us by the way and while he opened to us thescriptures   and they rose up the same hour and returned tojerusalem and found the eleven gathered together and them that werewith them  saying the lord is risen indeed and hath appearedto simon and they told what things were done in the way and how he wasknown of them in breaking of bread and as they thus spake jesus himself stood in the midst ofthem and saith unto them peace be unto you but they were terrified and affrighted and supposed that theyhad seen a spirit and he said unto them why are ye troubled and why do thoughtsarise in your hearts   behold my hands and my feet that it is imyself handle me and see for a spirit hath not flesh and bones asye see me have and when he had thus spoken he shewed them his hands and hisfeet and while they yet believed not for joy and wondered he saidunto them have ye here any meat   and they gave him a piece ofa broiled fish and of an honeycomb and he took it and did eat before them and he said unto them these are the words which i spake untoyou while i was yet with you that all things must be fulfilledwhich were written in the law of moses and in the prophets and inthe psalms concerning me then opened he their understanding that they might understandthe scriptures  and said unto them thus it is written and thusit behoved christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached inhis name among all nations beginning at jerusalem and ye are witnesses of these things and behold i send the promise of my father upon you but tarryye in the city of jerusalem until ye be endued with power from onhigh and he led them out as far as to bethany and he lifted up hishands and blessed them and it came to pass while he blessed them he was parted fromthem and carried up into heaven and they worshipped him and returned to jerusalem with greatjoy  and were continually in the temple praising and blessinggod amenthe gospel according to saint john in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and theword was god the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him and without him was not any thingmade that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehendedit not there was a man sent from god whose name was john the same came for a witness to bear witness of the light thatall men through him might believe he was not that light but was sent to bear witness of that light that was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh intothe world he was in the world and the world was made by him and the worldknew him not he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become thesons of god even to them that believe on his name  which wereborn not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will ofman but of god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheldhis glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full ofgrace and truth john bare witness of him and cried saying this was he of whomi spake he that cometh after me is preferred before me for he wasbefore me and of his fulness have all we received and grace for grace for the law was given by moses but grace and truth came by jesuschrist no man hath seen god at any time the only begotten son which isin the bosom of the father he hath declared him and this is the record of john when the jews sent priests andlevites from jerusalem to ask him who art thou   and heconfessed and denied not but confessed i am not the christ and they asked him what then art thou elias and he saith i amnot art thou that prophet and he answered no then said they unto him who art thou that we may give an answerto them that sent us what sayest thou of thyself   he said i amthe voice of one crying in the wilderness make straight the way ofthe lord as said the prophet esaias and they which were sent were of the pharisees and they asked him and said unto him why baptizest thou thenif thou be not that christ nor elias neither that prophet  john answered them saying i baptize with water but there standethone among you whom ye know not  he it is who coming after me ispreferred before me whose shoes latchet i am not worthy to unloose these things were done in bethabara beyond jordan where john wasbaptizing the next day john seeth jesus coming unto him and saith beholdthe lamb of god which taketh away the sin of the world this is he of whom i said after me cometh a man which ispreferred before me for he was before me and i knew him not but that he should be made manifest toisrael therefore am i come baptizing with water and john bare record saying i saw the spirit descending fromheaven like a dove and it abode upon him and i knew him not but he that sent me to baptize with waterthe same said unto me upon whom thou shalt see the spirit descendingand remaining on him the same is he which baptizeth with the holyghost and i saw and bare record that this is the son of god again the next day after john stood and two of his disciples and looking upon jesus as he walked he saith behold the lamb ofgod   and the two disciples heard him speak and they followedjesus then jesus turned and saw them following and saith unto themwhat seek ye they said unto him rabbi which is to say beinginterpreted master where dwellest thou   he saith unto themcome and see they came and saw where he dwelt and abode with himthat day for it was about the tenth hour one of the two which heard john speak and followed him wasandrew simon peters brother he first findeth his own brother simon and saith unto him wehave found the messias which is being interpreted the christ and he brought him to jesus and when jesus beheld him he saidthou art simon the son of jona thou shalt be called cephas which isby interpretation a stone the day following jesus would go forth into galilee and findethphilip and saith unto him follow me now philip was of bethsaida the city of andrew and peter philip findeth nathanael and saith unto him we have found himof whom moses in the law and the prophets did write jesus ofnazareth the son of joseph and nathanael said unto him can there any good thing come out ofnazareth philip saith unto him come and see jesus saw nathanael coming to him and saith of him behold anisraelite indeed in whom is no guile   nathanael saith unto himwhence knowest thou me jesus answered and said unto him before thatphilip called thee when thou wast under the fig tree i saw thee nathanael answered and saith unto him rabbi thou art the son ofgod thou art the king of israel jesus answered and said unto him because i said unto thee i sawthee under the fig tree believest thou thou shalt see greater thingsthan these and he saith unto him verily verily i say unto you hereafterye shall see heaven open and the angels of god ascending anddescending upon the son of man and the third day there was a marriage in cana of galilee and themother of jesus was there  and both jesus was called and hisdisciples to the marriage and when they wanted wine the mother of jesus saith unto himthey have no wine jesus saith unto her woman what have i to do with thee minehour is not yet come his mother saith unto the servants whatsoever he saith unto youdo it and there were set there six waterpots of stone after the mannerof the purifying of the jews containing two or three firkins apiece jesus saith unto them fill the waterpots with water and theyfilled them up to the brim and he saith unto them draw out now and bear unto the governorof the feast and they bare it when the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was madewine and knew not whence it was but the servants which drew thewater knew the governor of the feast called the bridegroom  andsaith unto him every man at the beginning doth set forth good wineand when men have well drunk then that which is worse but thou hastkept the good wine until now this beginning of miracles did jesus in cana of galilee andmanifested forth his glory and his disciples believed on him after this he went down to capernaum he and his mother and hisbrethren and his disciples and they continued there not many days and the jews passover was at hand and jesus went up tojerusalem and found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and dovesand the changers of money sitting  and when he had made a scourgeof small cords he drove them all out of the temple and the sheepand the oxen and poured out the changers money and overthrew thetables  and said unto them that sold doves take these thingshence make not my fathers house an house of merchandise and his disciples remembered that it was written the zeal ofthine house hath eaten me up then answered the jews and said unto him what sign shewest thouunto us seeing that thou doest these things   jesus answered andsaid unto them destroy this temple and in three days i will raise itup then said the jews forty and six years was this temple inbuilding and wilt thou rear it up in three days   but he spakeof the temple of his body when therefore he was risen from the dead his disciplesremembered that he had said this unto them and they believed thescripture and the word which jesus had said now when he was in jerusalem at the passover in the feast daymany believed in his name when they saw the miracles which he did but jesus did not commit himself unto them because he knew allmen  and needed not that any should testify of man for he knewwhat was in man there was a man of the pharisees named nicodemus a ruler of thejews  the same came to jesus by night and said unto him rabbiwe know that thou art a teacher come from god for no man can do thesemiracles that thou doest except god be with him jesus answered and said unto him verily verily i say unto theeexcept a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god nicodemus saith unto him how can a man be born when he is oldcan he enter the second time into his mothers womb and be born  jesus answered verily verily i say unto thee except a man be bornof water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of god that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is bornof the spirit is spirit marvel not that i said unto thee ye must be born again the wind bloweth where it listeth and thou hearest the soundthereof but canst not tell whence it cometh and whither it goeth sois every one that is born of the spirit nicodemus answered and said unto him how can these things be jesus answered and said unto him art thou a master of israeland knowest not these things   verily verily i say unto theewe speak that we do know and testify that we have seen and yereceive not our witness if i have told you earthly things and ye believe not how shallye believe if i tell you of heavenly things   and no man hathascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven even the sonof man which is in heaven and as moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even somust the son of man be lifted up  that whosoever believeth in himshould not perish but have eternal life for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten sonthat whosoever believeth in him should not perish but haveeverlasting life for god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world butthat the world through him might be saved he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believethnot is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name ofthe only begotten son of god and this is the condemnation that light is come into the worldand men loved darkness rather than light because their deeds wereevil for every one that doeth evil hateth the light neither cometh tothe light lest his deeds should be reproved but he that doeth truth cometh to the light that his deeds maybe made manifest that they are wrought in god after these things came jesus and his disciples into the land ofjudaea and there he tarried with them and baptized and john also was baptizing in aenon near to salim because therewas much water there and they came and were baptized for john was not yet cast into prison then there arose a question between some of johns disciples andthe jews about purifying and they came unto john and said unto him rabbi he that waswith thee beyond jordan to whom thou barest witness behold the samebaptizeth and all men come to him john answered and said a man can receive nothing except it begiven him from heaven ye yourselves bear me witness that i said i am not the christbut that i am sent before him he that hath the bride is the bridegroom but the friend of thebridegroom which standeth and heareth him rejoiceth greatly becauseof the bridegrooms voice this my joy therefore is fulfilled he must increase but i must decrease he that cometh from above is above all he that is of the earthis earthly and speaketh of the earth he that cometh from heaven isabove all and what he hath seen and heard that he testifieth and no manreceiveth his testimony he that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that godis true for he whom god hath sent speaketh the words of god for godgiveth not the spirit by measure unto him the father loveth the son and hath given all things into hishand he that believeth on the son hath everlasting life and he thatbelieveth not the son shall not see life but the wrath of god abidethon him when therefore the lord knew how the pharisees had heard thatjesus made and baptized more disciples than john  though jesushimself baptized not but his disciples  he left judaea anddeparted again into galilee and he must needs go through samaria then cometh he to a city of samaria which is called sychar nearto the parcel of ground that jacob gave to his son joseph now jacobs well was there jesus therefore being wearied withhis journey sat thus on the well and it was about the sixth hour there cometh a woman of samaria to draw water jesus saith untoher give me to drink for his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat  then saith the woman of samaria unto him how is it that thou being ajew askest drink of me which am a woman of samaria for the jewshave no dealings with the samaritans jesus answered and said unto her if thou knewest the gift ofgod and who it is that saith to thee give me to drink thou wouldesthave asked of him and he would have given thee living water the woman saith unto him sir thou hast nothing to draw withand the well is deep from whence then hast thou that living water art thou greater than our father jacob which gave us the welland drank thereof himself and his children and his cattle  jesus answered and said unto her whosoever drinketh of this watershall thirst again  but whosoever drinketh of the water that ishall give him shall never thirst but the water that i shall give himshall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life the woman saith unto him sir give me this water that i thirstnot neither come hither to draw jesus saith unto her go call thy husband and come hither the woman answered and said i have no husband jesus said untoher thou hast well said i have no husband  for thou hast hadfive husbands and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband in thatsaidst thou truly the woman saith unto him sir i perceive that thou art aprophet our fathers worshipped in this mountain and ye say that injerusalem is the place where men ought to worship jesus saith unto her woman believe me the hour cometh when yeshall neither in this mountain nor yet at jerusalem worship thefather ye worship ye know not what we know what we worship forsalvation is of the jews but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshippers shallworship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh suchto worship him god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him inspirit and in truth the woman saith unto him i know that messias cometh which iscalled christ when he is come he will tell us all things jesus saith unto her i that speak unto thee am he and upon this came his disciples and marvelled that he talkedwith the woman yet no man said what seekest thou or why talkestthou with her   the woman then left her waterpot and went herway into the city and saith to the men  come see a man whichtold me all things that ever i did is not this the christ   thenthey went out of the city and came unto him in the mean while his disciples prayed him saying master eat but he said unto them i have meat to eat that ye know not of therefore said the disciples one to another hath any man broughthim ought to eat   jesus saith unto them my meat is to do thewill of him that sent me and to finish his work say not ye there are yet four months and then cometh harvestbehold i say unto you lift up your eyes and look on the fields forthey are white already to harvest and he that reapeth receiveth wages and gathereth fruit untolife eternal that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoicetogether and herein is that saying true one soweth and another reapeth i sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour other menlaboured and ye are entered into their labours and many of the samaritans of that city believed on him for thesaying of the woman which testified he told me all that ever i did so when the samaritans were come unto him they besought him thathe would tarry with them and he abode there two days and many more believed because of his own word  and saidunto the woman now we believe not because of thy saying for we haveheard him ourselves and know that this is indeed the christ thesaviour of the world now after two days he departed thence and went into galilee for jesus himself testified that a prophet hath no honour in hisown country then when he was come into galilee the galilaeans received himhaving seen all the things that he did at jerusalem at the feast forthey also went unto the feast so jesus came again into cana of galilee where he made the waterwine and there was a certain nobleman whose son was sick atcapernaum when he heard that jesus was come out of judaea into galilee hewent unto him and besought him that he would come down and heal hisson for he was at the point of death then said jesus unto him except ye see signs and wonders yewill not believe the nobleman saith unto him sir come down ere my child die jesus saith unto him go thy way thy son liveth and the manbelieved the word that jesus had spoken unto him and he went his way and as he was now going down his servants met him and told himsaying thy son liveth then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend andthey said unto him yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him so the father knew that it was at the same hour in the whichjesus said unto him thy son liveth and himself believed and hiswhole house this is again the second miracle that jesus did when he was comeout of judaea into galilee after this there was a feast of the jews and jesus went up tojerusalem now there is at jerusalem by the sheep market a pool which iscalled in the hebrew tongue bethesda having five porches in these lay a great multitude of impotent folk of blind haltwithered waiting for the moving of the water for an angel went down at a certain season into the pool andtroubled the water whosoever then first after the troubling of thewater stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had and a certain man was there which had an infirmity thirty andeight years when jesus saw him lie and knew that he had been now a long timein that case he saith unto him wilt thou be made whole   theimpotent man answered him sir i have no man when the water istroubled to put me into the pool but while i am coming anothersteppeth down before me jesus saith unto him rise take up thy bed and walk and immediately the man was made whole and took up his bed andwalked and on the same day was the sabbath the jews therefore said unto him that was cured it is thesabbath day it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed he answered them he that made me whole the same said unto metake up thy bed and walk then asked they him what man is that which said unto thee takeup thy bed and walk   and he that was healed wist not who itwas for jesus had conveyed himself away a multitude being in thatplace afterward jesus findeth him in the temple and said unto himbehold thou art made whole sin no more lest a worse thing come untothee the man departed and told the jews that it was jesus which hadmade him whole and therefore did the jews persecute jesus and sought to slayhim because he had done these things on the sabbath day but jesus answered them my father worketh hitherto and i work therefore the jews sought the more to kill him because he notonly had broken the sabbath but said also that god was his fathermaking himself equal with god then answered jesus and said unto them verily verily i sayunto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth thefather do for what things soever he doeth these also doeth the sonlikewise for the father loveth the son and sheweth him all things thathimself doeth and he will shew him greater works than these that yemay marvel for as the father raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them evenso the son quickeneth whom he will for the father judgeth no man but hath committed all judgmentunto the son  that all men should honour the son even as theyhonour the fatherhe that honoureth not the son honoureth not the father which hath senthim verily verily i say unto you he that heareth my word andbelieveth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall notcome into condemnation but is passed from death unto life verily verily i say unto you the hour is coming and now iswhen the dead shall hear the voice of the son of god and they thathear shall live for as the father hath life in himself so hath he given to theson to have life in himself  and hath given him authority toexecute judgment also because he is the son of man marvel not at this for the hour is coming in the which all thatare in the graves shall hear his voice  and shall come forththey that have done good unto the resurrection of life and they thathave done evil unto the resurrection of damnation i can of mine own self do nothing as i hear i judge and myjudgment is just because i seek not mine own will but the will ofthe father which hath sent me if i bear witness of myself my witness is not true there is another that beareth witness of me and i know that thewitness which he witnesseth of me is true ye sent unto john and he bare witness unto the truth but i receive not testimony from man but these things i saythat ye might be saved he was a burning and a shining light and ye were willing for aseason to rejoice in his light but i have greater witness than that of john for the works whichthe father hath given me to finish the same works that i do bearwitness of me that the father hath sent me and the father himself which hath sent me hath borne witness ofmeye have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his shape and ye have not his word abiding in you for whom he hath senthim ye believe not search the scriptures for in them ye think ye have eternal lifeand they are they which testify of me and ye will not come to me that ye might have life i receive not honour from men but i know you that ye have not the love of god in you i am come in my fathers name and ye receive me not if anothershall come in his own name him ye will receive how can ye believe which receive honour one of another and seeknot the honour that cometh from god only   do not think that iwill accuse you to the father there is one that accuseth you evenmoses in whom ye trust for had ye believed moses ye would have believed me for hewrote of me but if ye believe not his writings how shall ye believe mywords   after these things jesus went over the sea of galileewhich is the sea of tiberias and a great multitude followed him because they saw his miracleswhich he did on them that were diseased and jesus went up into a mountain and there he sat with hisdisciples and the passover a feast of the jews was nigh when jesus then lifted up his eyes and saw a great company comeunto him he saith unto philip whence shall we buy bread that thesemay eat   and this he said to prove him for he himself knew whathe would do philip answered him two hundred pennyworth of bread is notsufficient for them that every one of them may take a little one of his disciples andrew simon peters brother saith untohim  there is a lad here which hath five barley loaves and twosmall fishes but what are they among so many   and jesus saidmake the men sit down now there was much grass in the place so themen sat down in number about five thousand and jesus took the loaves and when he had given thanks hedistributed to the disciples and the disciples to them that were setdown and likewise of the fishes as much as they would when they were filled he said unto his disciples gather up thefragments that remain that nothing be lost therefore they gathered them together and filled twelve basketswith the fragments of the five barley loaves which remained over andabove unto them that had eaten then those men when they had seen the miracle that jesus didsaid this is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world when jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take himby force to make him a king he departed again into a mountainhimself alone and when even was now come his disciples went down unto the sea and entered into a ship and went over the sea toward capernaumand it was now dark and jesus was not come to them and the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew so when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongsthey see jesus walking on the sea and drawing nigh unto the ship andthey were afraid but he saith unto them it is i be not afraid then they willingly received him into the ship and immediatelythe ship was at the land whither they went the day following when the people which stood on the other sideof the sea saw that there was none other boat there save that onewhereinto his disciples were entered and that jesus went not with hisdisciples into the boat but that his disciples were gone away alone howbeit there came other boats from tiberias nigh unto the placewhere they did eat bread after that the lord had given thanks when the people therefore saw that jesus was not there neither hisdisciples they also took shipping and came to capernaum seeking forjesus and when they had found him on the other side of the sea theysaid unto him rabbi when camest thou hither   jesus answeredthem and said verily verily i say unto you ye seek me not becauseye saw the miracles but because ye did eat of the loaves and werefilled labour not for the meat which perisheth but for that meat whichendureth unto everlasting life which the son of man shall give untoyou for him hath god the father sealed then said they unto him what shall we do that we might work theworks of god   jesus answered and said unto them this is thework of god that ye believe on him whom he hath sent they said therefore unto him what sign shewest thou then thatwe may see and believe thee what dost thou work   our fathersdid eat manna in the desert as it is written he gave them bread fromheaven to eat then jesus said unto them verily verily i say unto you mosesgave you not that bread from heaven but my father giveth you the truebread from heaven for the bread of god is he which cometh down from heaven andgiveth life unto the world then said they unto him lord evermore give us this bread and jesus said unto them i am the bread of life he that comethto me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall neverthirst but i said unto you that ye also have seen me and believe not all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him thatcometh to me i will in no wise cast out for i came down from heaven not to do mine own will but thewill of him that sent me and this is the fathers will which hath sent me that of allwhich he hath given me i should lose nothing but should raise it upagain at the last day and this is the will of him that sent me that every one whichseeth the son and believeth on him may have everlasting life and iwill raise him up at the last day the jews then murmured at him because he said i am the breadwhich came down from heaven and they said is not this jesus the son of joseph whose fatherand mother we know how is it then that he saith i came down fromheaven   jesus therefore answered and said unto them murmur notamong yourselves no man can come to me except the father which hath sent me drawhim and i will raise him up at the last day it is written in the prophets and they shall be all taught ofgodevery man therefore that hath heard and hath learned of the fathercometh unto me not that any man hath seen the father save he which is of godhe hath seen the father verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me hatheverlasting life i am that bread of life your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness and are dead this is the bread which cometh down from heaven that a man mayeat thereof and not die i am the living bread which came down from heaven if any man eatof this bread he shall live for ever and the bread that i will giveis my flesh which i will give for the life of the world the jews therefore strove among themselves saying how can thisman give us his flesh to eat   then jesus said unto them verilyverily i say unto you except ye eat the flesh of the son of man anddrink his blood ye have no life in you whoso eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal lifeand i will raise him up at the last day for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in meand i in him as the living father hath sent me and i live by the father sohe that eateth me even he shall live by me this is that bread which came down from heaven not as yourfathers did eat manna and are dead he that eateth of this breadshall live for ever these things said he in the synagogue as he taught in capernaum many therefore of his disciples when they had heard this saidthis is an hard saying who can hear it   when jesus knew inhimself that his disciples murmured at it he said unto them doththis offend you   what and if ye shall see the son of man ascendup where he was before   it is the spirit that quickeneth theflesh profiteth nothing the words that i speak unto you they arespirit and they are life but there are some of you that believe not for jesus knew fromthe beginning who they were that believed not and who should betrayhim and he said therefore said i unto you that no man can come untome except it were given unto him of my father from that time many of his disciples went back and walked nomore with him then said jesus unto the twelve will ye also go away   thensimon peter answered him lord to whom shall we go thou hast thewords of eternal life and we believe and are sure that thou art that christ the son ofthe living god jesus answered them have not i chosen you twelve and one of youis a devil   he spake of judas iscariot the son of simon for heit was that should betray him being one of the twelve after these things jesus walked in galilee for he would not walkin jewry because the jews sought to kill him now the jews feast of tabernacles was at hand his brethren therefore said unto him depart hence and go intojudaea that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest for there is no man that doeth any thing in secret and he himselfseeketh to be known openly if thou do these things shew thyself tothe world for neither did his brethren believe in him then jesus said unto them my time is not yet come but your timeis alway ready the world cannot hate you but me it hateth because i testify ofit that the works thereof are evil go ye up unto this feast i go not up yet unto this feast for mytime is not yet full come when he had said these words unto them he abode still in galilee but when his brethren were gone up then went he also up unto thefeast not openly but as it were in secret then the jews sought him at the feast and said where is he and there was much murmuring among the people concerning him forsome said he is a good man others said nay but he deceiveth thepeople howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the jews now about the midst of the feast jesus went up into the templeand taught and the jews marvelled saying how knoweth this man lettershaving never learned   jesus answered them and said my doctrineis not mine but his that sent me if any man will do his will he shall know of the doctrinewhether it be of god or whether i speak of myself he that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory but he thatseeketh his glory that sent him the same is true and nounrighteousness is in him did not moses give you the law and yet none of you keepeth thelaw  why go ye about to kill me   the people answered and saidthou hast a devil who goeth about to kill thee   jesus answeredand said unto them i have done one work and ye all marvel moses therefore gave unto you circumcision not because it is ofmoses but of the fathers and ye on the sabbath day circumcise aman if a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision that the law ofmoses should not be broken are ye angry at me because i have made aman every whit whole on the sabbath day   judge not according tothe appearance but judge righteous judgment then said some of them of jerusalem is not this he whom theyseek to kill   but lo he speaketh boldly and they say nothingunto him do the rulers know indeed that this is the very christ howbeit we know this man whence he is but when christ cometh noman knoweth whence he is then cried jesus in the temple as he taught saying ye both knowme and ye know whence i am and i am not come of myself but he thatsent me is true whom ye know not but i know him for i am from him and he hath sent me then they sought to take him but no man laid hands on himbecause his hour was not yet come and many of the people believed on him and said when christcometh will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done the pharisees heard that the people murmured such thingsconcerning him and the pharisees and the chief priests sent officersto take him then said jesus unto them yet a little while am i with you andthen i go unto him that sent me ye shall seek me and shall not find me and where i am thitherye cannot come then said the jews among themselves whither will he go that weshall not find him will he go unto the dispersed among the gentilesand teach the gentiles   what manner of saying is this that hesaid ye shall seek me and shall not find me and where i am thitherye cannot come   in the last day that great day of the feastjesus stood and cried saying if any man thirst let him come untome and drink he that believeth on me as the scripture hath said out of hisbelly shall flow rivers of living water but this spake he of the spirit which they that believe on himshould receive for the holy ghost was not yet given because thatjesus was not yet glorified   many of the people therefore whenthey heard this saying said of a truth this is the prophet others said this is the christ but some said shall christ comeout of galilee   hath not the scripture said that christ comethof the seed of david and out of the town of bethlehem where davidwas   so there was a division among the people because of him and some of them would have taken him but no man laid hands onhim then came the officers to the chief priests and pharisees andthey said unto them why have ye not brought him   the officersanswered never man spake like this man then answered them the pharisees are ye also deceived  have any of the rulers or of the pharisees believed on him   butthis people who knoweth not the law are cursed nicodemus saith unto them he that came to jesus by night beingone of them  doth our law judge any man before it hear him andknow what he doeth   they answered and said unto him art thoualso of galilee  search and look for out of galilee ariseth noprophet and every man went unto his own house jesus went unto the mount of olives and early in the morning he came again into the temple and allthe people came unto him and he sat down and taught them and the scribes and pharisees brought unto him a woman taken inadultery and when they had set her in the midst  they say untohim master this woman was taken in adultery in the very act now moses in the law commanded us that such should be stoned butwhat sayest thou   this they said tempting him that they mighthave to accuse him but jesus stooped down and with his finger wroteon the ground as though he heard them not so when they continued asking him he lifted up himself and saidunto them he that is without sin among you let him first cast astone at her and again he stooped down and wrote on the ground and they which heard it being convicted by their own consciencewent out one by one beginning at the eldest even unto the last andjesus was left alone and the woman standing in the midst when jesus had lifted up himself and saw none but the woman hesaid unto her woman where are those thine accusers hath no mancondemned thee   she said no man lord and jesus said unto herneither do i condemn thee go and sin no more then spake jesus again unto them saying i am the light of theworld he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall havethe light of life the pharisees therefore said unto him thou bearest record ofthyself thy record is not true jesus answered and said unto them though i bear record ofmyself yet my record is true for i know whence i came and whither igo but ye cannot tell whence i come and whither i go ye judge after the flesh i judge no man and yet if i judge my judgment is true for i am not alone buti and the father that sent me it is also written in your law that the testimony of two men istrue i am one that bear witness of myself and the father that sent mebeareth witness of me then said they unto him where is thy father jesus answered yeneither know me nor my father if ye had known me ye should haveknown my father also these words spake jesus in the treasury as he taught in thetemple and no man laid hands on him for his hour was not yet come then said jesus again unto them i go my way and ye shall seekme and shall die in your sins whither i go ye cannot come then said the jews will he kill himself because he saithwhither i go ye cannot come and he said unto them ye are from beneath i am from above yeare of this world i am not of this world i said therefore unto you that ye shall die in your sins for ifye believe not that i am he ye shall die in your sins then said they unto him who art thou and jesus saith unto themeven the same that i said unto you from the beginning i have many things to say and to judge of you but he that sentme is true and i speak to the world those things which i have heardof him they understood not that he spake to them of the father then said jesus unto them when ye have lifted up the son of manthen shall ye know that i am he and that i do nothing of myself butas my father hath taught me i speak these things and he that sent me is with me the father hath not left mealone for i do always those things that please him as he spake these words many believed on him then said jesus to those jews which believed on him if yecontinue in my word then are ye my disciples indeed  and yeshall know the truth and the truth shall make you free they answered him we be abrahams seed and were never inbondage to any man how sayest thou ye shall be made free  jesus answered them verily verily i say unto you whosoevercommitteth sin is the servant of sin and the servant abideth not in the house for ever but the sonabideth ever if the son therefore shall make you free ye shall be freeindeed i know that ye are abrahams seed but ye seek to kill mebecause my word hath no place in you i speak that which i have seen with my father and ye do thatwhich ye have seen with your father they answered and said unto him abraham is our father jesussaith unto them if ye were abrahams children ye would do the worksof abraham but now ye seek to kill me a man that hath told you the truthwhich i have heard of god this did not abraham ye do the deeds of your father then said they to him we be notborn of fornication we have one father even god jesus said unto them if god were your father ye would love mefor i proceeded forth and came from god neither came i of myself buthe sent me why do ye not understand my speech even because ye cannot hearmy word ye are of your father the devil and the lusts of your father yewill do he was a murderer from the beginning and abode not in thetruth because there is no truth in him when he speaketh a lie hespeaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of it and because i tell you the truth ye believe me not which of you convinceth me of sin and if i say the truth why doye not believe me   he that is of god heareth gods words yetherefore hear them not because ye are not of god then answered the jews and said unto him say we not well thatthou art a samaritan and hast a devil   jesus answered i havenot a devil but i honour my father and ye do dishonour me and i seek not mine own glory there is one that seeketh andjudgeth verily verily i say unto you if a man keep my saying he shallnever see death then said the jews unto him now we know that thou hast a devilabraham is dead and the prophets and thou sayest if a man keep mysaying he shall never taste of death art thou greater than our father abraham which is dead and theprophets are dead whom makest thou thyself   jesus answered ifi honour myself my honour is nothing it is my father that honourethme of whom ye say that he is your god  yet ye have not knownhim but i know him and if i should say i know him not i shall be aliar like unto you but i know him and keep his saying your father abraham rejoiced to see my day and he saw it andwas glad then said the jews unto him thou art not yet fifty years oldand hast thou seen abraham   jesus said unto them verilyverily i say unto you before abraham was i am then took they up stones to cast at him but jesus hid himselfand went out of the temple going through the midst of them and sopassed by and as jesus passed by he saw a man which was blind from hisbirth and his disciples asked him saying master who did sin thisman or his parents that he was born blind   jesus answeredneither hath this man sinned nor his parents but that the works ofgod should be made manifest in him i must work the works of him that sent me while it is day thenight cometh when no man can work as long as i am in the world i am the light of the world when he had thus spoken he spat on the ground and made clay ofthe spittle and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay and said unto him go wash in the pool of siloam which is byinterpretation sent he went his way therefore and washed and cameseeing the neighbours therefore and they which before had seen him thathe was blind said is not this he that sat and begged   somesaid this is he others said he is like him but he said i am he therefore said they unto him how were thine eyes opened  he answered and said a man that is called jesus made clay andanointed mine eyes and said unto me go to the pool of siloam andwash and i went and washed and i received sight then said they unto him where is he he said i know not they brought to the pharisees him that aforetime was blind and it was the sabbath day when jesus made the clay and openedhis eyes then again the pharisees also asked him how he had received hissight he said unto them he put clay upon mine eyes and i washedand do see therefore said some of the pharisees this man is not of godbecause he keepeth not the sabbath day others said how can a manthat is a sinner do such miracles and there was a division amongthem they say unto the blind man again what sayest thou of him thathe hath opened thine eyes he said he is a prophet but the jews did not believe concerning him that he had beenblind and received his sight until they called the parents of himthat had received his sight and they asked them saying is this your son who ye say wasborn blind how then doth he now see   his parents answered themand said we know that this is our son and that he was born blind but by what means he now seeth we know not or who hath openedhis eyes we know not he is of age ask him he shall speak forhimself these words spake his parents because they feared the jews forthe jews had agreed already that if any man did confess that he waschrist he should be put out of the synagogue therefore said his parents he is of age ask him then again called they the man that was blind and said unto himgive god the praise we know that this man is a sinner he answered and said whether he be a sinner or no i know notone thing i know that whereas i was blind now i see then said they to him again what did he to thee how opened hethine eyes   he answered them i have told you already and yedid not hear wherefore would ye hear it again will ye also be hisdisciples   then they reviled him and said thou art hisdisciple but we are moses disciples we know that god spake unto moses as for this fellow we knownot from whence he is the man answered and said unto them why herein is a marvellousthing that ye know not from whence he is and yet he hath opened mineeyes now we know that god heareth not sinners but if any man be aworshipper of god and doeth his will him he heareth since the world began was it not heard that any man opened theeyes of one that was born blind if this man were not of god he could do nothing they answered and said unto him thou wast altogether born insins and dost thou teach us and they cast him out jesus heard that they had cast him out and when he had foundhim he said unto him dost thou believe on the son of god   heanswered and said who is he lord that i might believe on him  and jesus said unto him thou hast both seen him and it is he thattalketh with thee and he said lord i believe and he worshipped him and jesus said for judgment i am come into this world that theywhich see not might see and that they which see might be made blind and some of the pharisees which were with him heard these wordsand said unto him are we blind also   jesus said unto them ifye were blind ye should have no sin but now ye say we seetherefore your sin remaineth verily verily i say unto you he that entereth not by the doorinto the sheepfold but climbeth up some other way the same is athief and a robber but he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep to him the porter openeth and the sheep hear his voice and hecalleth his own sheep by name and leadeth them out and when he putteth forth his own sheep he goeth before themand the sheep follow him for they know his voice and a stranger will they not follow but will flee from him forthey know not the voice of strangers this parable spake jesus unto them but they understood not whatthings they were which he spake unto them then said jesus unto them again verily verily i say unto youi am the door of the sheep all that ever came before me are thieves and robbers but thesheep did not hear them i am the door by me if any man enter in he shall be saved andshall go in and out and find pasture the thief cometh not but for to steal and to kill and todestroy i am come that they might have life and that they might haveit more abundantly i am the good shepherd the good shepherd giveth his life forthe sheep but he that is an hireling and not the shepherd whose own thesheep are not seeth the wolf coming and leaveth the sheep andfleeth and the wolf catcheth them and scattereth the sheep the hireling fleeth because he is an hireling and careth notfor the sheep i am the good shepherd and know my sheep and am known of mine as the father knoweth me even so know i the father and i laydown my life for the sheep and other sheep i have which are not of this fold them also imust bring and they shall hear my voice and there shall be one foldand one shepherd therefore doth my father love me because i lay down my lifethat i might take it again no man taketh it from me but i lay it down of myself i havepower to lay it down and i have power to take it again thiscommandment have i received of my father there was a division therefore again among the jews for thesesayings and many of them said he hath a devil and is mad why hear yehim   others said these are not the words of him that hath adevil can a devil open the eyes of the blind   and it was atjerusalem the feast of the dedication and it was winter and jesus walked in the temple in solomons porch then came the jews round about him and said unto him how longdost thou make us to doubt if thou be the christ tell us plainly jesus answered them i told you and ye believed not the worksthat i do in my fathers name they bear witness of me but ye believe not because ye are not of my sheep as i saidunto you my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me and i give unto them eternal life and they shall never perishneither shall any man pluck them out of my hand my father which gave them me is greater than all and no manis able to pluck them out of my fathers hand i and my father are one then the jews took up stones again to stone him jesus answered them many good works have i shewed you from myfather for which of those works do ye stone me   the jewsanswered him saying for a good work we stone thee not but forblasphemy and because that thou being a man makest thyself god jesus answered them is it not written in your law i said yeare gods   if he called them gods unto whom the word of godcame and the scripture cannot be broken  say ye of him whomthe father hath sanctified and sent into the world thou blasphemestbecause i said i am the son of god   if i do not the works ofmy father believe me not but if i do though ye believe not me believe the works thatye may know and believe that the father is in me and i in him therefore they sought again to take him but he escaped out oftheir hand  and went away again beyond jordan into the placewhere john at first baptized and there he abode and many resorted unto him and said john did no miracle butall things that john spake of this man were true and many believed on him there now a certain man was sick named lazarus of bethany the townof mary and her sister martha it was that mary which anointed the lord with ointment andwiped his feet with her hair whose brother lazarus was sick  therefore his sisters sent unto him saying lord behold he whomthou lovest is sick when jesus heard that he said this sickness is not unto deathbut for the glory of god that the son of god might be glorifiedthereby now jesus loved martha and her sister and lazarus when he had heard therefore that he was sick he abode two daysstill in the same place where he was then after that saith he to his disciples let us go into judaeaagain his disciples say unto him master the jews of late sought tostone thee and goest thou thither again   jesus answered arethere not twelve hours in the day if any man walk in the day hestumbleth not because he seeth the light of this world but if a man walk in the night he stumbleth because there isno light in him these things said he and after that he saith unto them ourfriend lazarus sleepeth but i go that i may awake him out of sleep then said his disciples lord if he sleep he shall do well howbeit jesus spake of his death but they thought that he hadspoken of taking of rest in sleep then said jesus unto them plainly lazarus is dead and i am glad for your sakes that i was not there to the intentye may believe nevertheless let us go unto him then said thomas which is called didymus unto hisfellowdisciples let us also go that we may die with him then when jesus came he found that he had lain in the gravefour days already now bethany was nigh unto jerusalem about fifteen furlongs off and many of the jews came to martha and mary to comfort themconcerning their brother then martha as soon as she heard that jesus was coming wentand met him but mary sat still in the house then said martha unto jesus lord if thou hadst been here mybrother had not died but i know that even now whatsoever thou wilt ask of god godwill give it thee jesus saith unto her thy brother shall rise again martha saith unto him i know that he shall rise again in theresurrection at the last day jesus said unto her i am the resurrection and the life hethat believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believestthou this   she saith unto him yea lord i believe that thouart the christ the son of god which should come into the world and when she had so said she went her way and called mary hersister secretly saying the master is come and calleth for thee as soon as she heard that she arose quickly and came unto him now jesus was not yet come into the town but was in that placewhere martha met him the jews then which were with her in the house and comfortedher when they saw mary that she rose up hastily and went outfollowed her saying she goeth unto the grave to weep there then when mary was come where jesus was and saw him she felldown at his feet saying unto him lord if thou hadst been here mybrother had not died when jesus therefore saw her weeping and the jews also weepingwhich came with her he groaned in the spirit and was troubled and said where have ye laid him they said unto him lord comeand see jesus wept then said the jews behold how he loved him   and some ofthem said could not this man which opened the eyes of the blindhave caused that even this man should not have died   jesustherefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave it was acave and a stone lay upon it jesus said take ye away the stone martha the sister of himthat was dead saith unto him lord by this time he stinketh for hehath been dead four days jesus saith unto her said i not unto thee that if thouwouldest believe thou shouldest see the glory of god   thenthey took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid andjesus lifted up his eyes and said father i thank thee that thouhast heard me and i knew that thou hearest me always but because of thepeople which stand by i said it that they may believe that thou hastsent me and when he thus had spoken he cried with a loud voicelazarus come forth and he that was dead came forth bound hand and foot withgraveclothes and his face was bound about with a napkin jesus saithunto them loose him and let him go then many of the jews which came to mary and had seen thethings which jesus did believed on him but some of them went their ways to the pharisees and told themwhat things jesus had done then gathered the chief priests and the pharisees a council andsaid what do we for this man doeth many miracles if we let him thus alone all men will believe on him and theromans shall come and take away both our place and nation and one of them named caiaphas being the high priest that sameyear said unto them ye know nothing at all  nor consider thatit is expedient for us that one man should die for the people andthat the whole nation perish not and this spake he not of himself but being high priest thatyear he prophesied that jesus should die for that nation  andnot for that nation only but that also he should gather together inone the children of god that were scattered abroad then from that day forth they took counsel together for to puthim to death jesus therefore walked no more openly among the jews but wentthence unto a country near to the wilderness into a city calledephraim and there continued with his disciples and the jews passover was nigh at hand and many went out ofthe country up to jerusalem before the passover to purify themselves then sought they for jesus and spake among themselves as theystood in the temple what think ye that he will not come to thefeast   now both the chief priests and the pharisees had given acommandment that if any man knew where he were he should shew itthat they might take him then jesus six days before the passover came to bethany wherelazarus was which had been dead whom he raised from the dead there they made him a supper and martha served but lazarus wasone of them that sat at the table with him then took mary a pound of ointment of spikenard very costly andanointed the feet of jesus and wiped his feet with her hair and thehouse was filled with the odour of the ointment then saith one of his disciples judas iscariot simons sonwhich should betray him  why was not this ointment sold for threehundred pence and given to the poor   this he said not that hecared for the poor but because he was a thief and had the bag andbare what was put therein then said jesus let her alone against the day of my buryinghath she kept this for the poor always ye have with you but me ye have not always much people of the jews therefore knew that he was there andthey came not for jesus sake only but that they might see lazarusalso whom he had raised from the dead but the chief priests consulted that they might put lazarus alsoto death  because that by reason of him many of the jews wentaway and believed on jesus on the next day much people that were come to the feast whenthey heard that jesus was coming to jerusalem  took branches ofpalm trees and went forth to meet him and cried hosanna blessed isthe king of israel that cometh in the name of the lord and jesus when he had found a young ass sat thereon as it iswritten  fear not daughter of sion behold thy king comethsitting on an asss colt these things understood not his disciples at the first but whenjesus was glorified then remembered they that these things werewritten of him and that they had done these things unto him the people therefore that was with him when he called lazarusout of his grave and raised him from the dead bare record for this cause the people also met him for that they heard thathe had done this miracle the pharisees therefore said among themselves perceive ye howye prevail nothing behold the world is gone after him and there were certain greeks among them that came up to worshipat the feast  the same came therefore to philip which was ofbethsaida of galilee and desired him saying sir we would seejesus philip cometh and telleth andrew and again andrew and philiptell jesus and jesus answered them saying the hour is come that the sonof man should be glorified verily verily i say unto you except a corn of wheat fall intothe ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forthmuch fruit he that loveth his life shall lose it and he that hateth hislife in this world shall keep it unto life eternal if any man serve me let him follow me and where i am thereshall also my servant be if any man serve me him will my fatherhonour now is my soul troubled and what shall i say father save mefrom this hour but for this cause came i unto this hour father glorify thy name then came there a voice from heavensaying i have both glorified it and will glorify it again the people therefore that stood by and heard it said that itthundered others said an angel spake to him jesus answered and said this voice came not because of me butfor your sakes now is the judgment of this world now shall the prince of thisworld be cast out and i if i be lifted up from the earth will draw all men untome this he said signifying what death he should die the people answered him we have heard out of the law thatchrist abideth for ever and how sayest thou the son of man must belifted up who is this son of man   then jesus said unto themyet a little while is the light with youwalk while ye have the light lest darkness come upon you for he thatwalketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth while ye have light believe in the light that ye may be thechildren of light these things spake jesus and departed and didhide himself from them but though he had done so many miracles before them yet theybelieved not on him  that the saying of esaias the prophet mightbe fulfilled which he spake lord who hath believed our report andto whom hath the arm of the lord been revealed   therefore theycould not believe because that esaias said again  he hathblinded their eyes and hardened their heart that they should not seewith their eyes nor understand with their heart and be convertedand i should heal them these things said esaias when he saw his glory and spake ofhim nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on himbut because of the pharisees they did not confess him lest theyshould be put out of the synagogue  for they loved the praise ofmen more than the praise of god jesus cried and said he that believeth on me believeth not onme but on him that sent me and he that seeth me seeth him that sent me i am come a light into the world that whosoever believeth on meshould not abide in darkness and if any man hear my words and believe not i judge him notfor i came not to judge the world but to save the world he that rejecteth me and receiveth not my words hath one thatjudgeth him the word that i have spoken the same shall judge him inthe last day for i have not spoken of myself but the father which sent mehe gave me a commandment what i should say and what i should speak and i know that his commandment is life everlasting whatsoeveri speak therefore even as the father said unto me so i speak now before the feast of the passover when jesus knew that hishour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the fatherhaving loved his own which were in the world he loved them unto theend and supper being ended the devil having now put into the heartof judas iscariot simons son to betray him  jesus knowing thatthe father had given all things into his hands and that he was comefrom god and went to god  he riseth from supper and laid asidehis garments and took a towel and girded himself after that he poureth water into a bason and began to wash thedisciples feet and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he wasgirded then cometh he to simon peter and peter saith unto him lorddost thou wash my feet   jesus answered and said unto him what ido thou knowest not now but thou shalt know hereafter peter saith unto him thou shalt never wash my feet jesusanswered him if i wash thee not thou hast no part with me simon peter saith unto him lord not my feet only but also myhands and my head jesus saith to him he that is washed needeth not save to washhis feet but is clean every whit and ye are clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore said he ye are notall clean so after he had washed their feet and had taken his garmentsand was set down again he said unto them know ye what i have done toyou   ye call me master and lord and ye say well for so i am if i then your lord and master have washed your feet ye alsoought to wash one anothers feet for i have given you an example that ye should do as i havedone to you verily verily i say unto you the servant is not greater thanhis lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if ye know these things happy are ye if ye do them i speak not of you all i know whom i have chosen but that thescripture may be fulfilled he that eateth bread with me hath liftedup his heel against me now i tell you before it come that when it is come to pass yemay believe that i am he verily verily i say unto you he that receiveth whomsoever isend receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sentme when jesus had thus said he was troubled in spirit andtestified and said verily verily i say unto you that one of youshall betray me then the disciples looked one on another doubting of whom hespake now there was leaning on jesus bosom one of his disciples whomjesus loved simon peter therefore beckoned to him that he should ask who itshould be of whom he spake he then lying on jesus breast saith unto him lord who is it jesus answered he it is to whom i shall give a sop when ihave dipped it and when he had dipped the sop he gave it to judasiscariot the son of simon and after the sop satan entered into him then said jesus untohim that thou doest do quickly now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this untohim for some of them thought because judas had the bag that jesushad said unto him buy those things that we have need of against thefeast or that he should give something to the poor he then having received the sop went immediately out and it wasnight therefore when he was gone out jesus said now is the son ofman glorified and god is glorified in him if god be glorified in him god shall also glorify him inhimself and shall straightway glorify him little children yet a little while i am with you ye shall seekme and as i said unto the jews whither i go ye cannot come so nowi say to you a new commandment i give unto you that ye love one another asi have loved you that ye also love one another by this shall all men know that ye are my disciples if ye havelove one to another simon peter said unto him lord whither goest thou jesusanswered him whither i go thou canst not follow me now but thoushalt follow me afterwards peter said unto him lord why cannot i follow thee now i willlay down my life for thy sake jesus answered him wilt thou lay down thy life for my sakeverily verily i say unto thee the cock shall not crow till thouhast denied me thrice let not your heart be troubled

have spoken unto you abide in me and i in you as the branch cannot bear fruit ofitself except it abide in the vine no more can ye except ye abidein me i am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and iin him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me ye can donothing if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and iswithered and men gather them and cast them into the fire and theyare burned if ye abide in me and my words abide in you ye shall ask whatye will and it shall be done unto you herein is my father glorified that ye bear much fruit so shallye be my disciples as the father hath loved me so have i loved you continue ye inmy love if ye keep my commandments ye shall abide in my love even as ihave kept my fathers commandments and abide in his love these things have i spoken unto you that my joy might remain inyou and that your joy might be full this is my commandment that ye love one another as i haveloved you greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his lifefor his friends ye are my friends if ye do whatsoever i command you henceforth i call you not servants for the servant knoweth notwhat his lord doeth but i have called you friends for all thingsthat i have heard of my father i have made known unto you ye have not chosen me but i have chosen you and ordained youthat ye should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit shouldremain that whatsoever ye shall ask of the father in my name he maygive it you these things i command you that ye love one another if the world hate you ye know that it hated me before it hatedyou if ye were of the world the world would love his own butbecause ye are not of the world but i have chosen you out of theworld therefore the world hateth you remember the word that i said unto you the servant is notgreater than his lord if they have persecuted me they will alsopersecute you if they have kept my saying they will keep yours also but all these things will they do unto you for my names sakebecause they know not him that sent me if i had not come and spoken unto them they had not had sinbut now they have no cloak for their sin he that hateth me hateth my father also if i had not done among them the works which none other man didthey had not had sin but now have they both seen and hated both meand my father but this cometh to pass that the word might be fulfilled thatis written in their law they hated me without a cause but when the comforter is come whom i will send unto you fromthe father even the spirit of truth which proceedeth from thefather he shall testify of me  and ye also shall bear witnessbecause ye have been with me from the beginning these things have i spoken unto you that ye should not beoffended they shall put you out of the synagogues yea the time comeththat whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth god service and these things will they do unto you because they have notknown the father nor me but these things have i told you that when the time shall comeye may remember that i told you of them and these things i said notunto you at the beginning because i was with you but now i go my way to him that sent me and none of you askethme whither goest thou   but because i have said these thingsunto you sorrow hath filled your heart nevertheless i tell you the truth it is expedient for you that igo away for if i go not away the comforter will not come unto youbut if i depart i will send him unto you and when he is come he will reprove the world of sin and ofrighteousness and of judgment  of sin because they believe noton me  of righteousness because i go to my father and ye seeme no more  of judgment because the prince of this world isjudged i have yet many things to say unto you but ye cannot bear themnow howbeit when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide youinto all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever heshall hear that shall he speak and he will shew you things to come he shall glorify me for he shall receive of mine and shallshew it unto you all things that the father hath are mine therefore said i thathe shall take of mine and shall shew it unto you a little while and ye shall not see me and again a littlewhile and ye shall see me because i go to the father then said some of his disciples among themselves what is thisthat he saith unto us a little while and ye shall not see me andagain a little while and ye shall see me and because i go to thefather   they said therefore what is this that he saith alittle while we cannot tell what he saith now jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him and said untothem do ye enquire among yourselves of that i said a little whileand ye shall not see me and again a little while and ye shall seeme   verily verily i say unto you that ye shall weep andlament but the world shall rejoice and ye shall be sorrowful butyour sorrow shall be turned into joy a woman when she is in travail hath sorrow because her hour iscome but as soon as she is delivered of the child she remembereth nomore the anguish for joy that a man is born into the world and ye now therefore have sorrow but i will see you again andyour heart shall rejoice and your joy no man taketh from you and in that day ye shall ask me nothing verily verily i sayunto you whatsoever ye shall ask the father in my name he will giveit you hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name ask and ye shallreceive that your joy may be full these things have i spoken unto you in proverbs but the timecometh when i shall no more speak unto you in proverbs but i shallshew you plainly of the father at that day ye shall ask in my name and i say not unto youthat i will pray the father for you  for the father himselfloveth you because ye have loved me and have believed that i cameout from god i came forth from the father and am come into the world againi leave the world and go to the father his disciples said unto him lo now speakest thou plainly andspeakest no proverb now are we sure that thou knowest all things and needest notthat any man should ask thee by this we believe that thou camestforth from god jesus answered them do ye now believe   behold the hourcometh yea is now come that ye shall be scattered every man to hisown and shall leave me alone and yet i am not alone because thefather is with me these things i have spoken unto you that in me ye might havepeacein the world ye shall have tribulation but be of good cheer i haveovercome the world these words spake jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven andsaid father the hour is come glorify thy son that thy son also mayglorify thee  as thou hast given him power over all flesh thathe should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him and this is life eternal that they might know thee the only truegod and jesus christ whom thou hast sent i have glorified thee on the earth i have finished the workwhich thou gavest me to do and now o father glorify thou me with thine own self with theglory which i had with thee before the world was i have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me outof the world thine they were and thou gavest them me and they havekept thy word now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given meare of thee for i have given unto them the words which thou gavest me andthey have received them and have known surely that i came out fromthee and they have believed that thou didst send me i pray for them i pray not for the world but for them whichthou hast given me for they are thine and all mine are thine and thine are mine and i am glorifiedin them and now i am no more in the world but these are in the worldand i come to thee holy father keep through thine own name thosewhom thou hast given me that they may be one as we are while i was with them in the world i kept them in thy namethose that thou gavest me i have kept and none of them is lost butthe son of perdition that the scripture might be fulfilled and now come i to thee and these things i speak in the worldthat they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves i have given them thy word and the world hath hated thembecause they are not of the world even as i am not of the world i pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world butthat thou shouldest keep them from the evil they are not of the world even as i am not of the world sanctify them through thy truth thy word is truth as thou hast sent me into the world even so have i also sentthem into the world and for their sakes i sanctify myself that they also might besanctified through the truth neither pray i for these alone but for them also which shallbelieve on me through their word  that they all may be one asthou father art in me and i in thee that they also may be one inus that the world may believe that thou hast sent me and the glory which thou gavest me i have given them that theymay be one even as we are one  i in them and thou in me thatthey may be made perfect in one and that the world may know that thouhast sent me and hast loved them as thou hast loved me father i will that they also whom thou hast given me be withme where i am that they may behold my glory which thou hast givenme for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world o righteous father the world hath not known thee but i haveknown thee and these have known that thou hast sent me and i have declared unto them thy name and will declare itthat the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them and i inthem when jesus had spoken these words he went forth with hisdisciples over the brook cedron where was a garden into the which heentered and his disciples and judas also which betrayed him knew the place for jesusofttimes resorted thither with his disciples judas then having received a band of men and officers from thechief priests and pharisees cometh thither with lanterns and torchesand weapons jesus therefore knowing all things that should come upon himwent forth and said unto them whom seek ye   they answered himjesus of nazareth jesus saith unto them i am heand judas also which betrayed him stood with them as soon then as he had said unto them i am he they wentbackward and fell to the ground then asked he them again whom seek ye and they said jesus ofnazareth jesus answered i have told you that i am he if therefore yeseek me let these go their way  that the saying might befulfilled which he spake of them which thou gavest me have i lostnone then simon peter having a sword drew it and smote the highpriests servant and cut off his right ear the servants name wasmalchus then said jesus unto peter put up thy sword into the sheaththe cup which my father hath given me shall i not drink it  then the band and the captain and officers of the jews took jesus andbound him  and led him away to annas first for he was father inlaw to caiaphas which was the high priest that same year now caiaphas was he which gave counsel to the jews that it wasexpedient that one man should die for the people and simon peter followed jesus and so did another disciplethat disciple was known unto the high priest and went in with jesusinto the palace of the high priest but peter stood at the door without then went out that otherdisciple which was known unto the high priest and spake unto herthat kept the door and brought in peter then saith the damsel that kept the door unto peter art notthou also one of this mans disciples he saith i am not and the servants and officers stood there who had made a fireof coals for it was cold and they warmed themselves and peter stoodwith them and warmed himself the high priest then asked jesus of his disciples and of hisdoctrine jesus answered him i spake openly to the world i ever taughtin the synagogue and in the temple whither the jews always resortand in secret have i said nothing why askest thou me ask them which heard me what i have saidunto them behold they know what i said and when he had thus spoken one of the officers which stood bystruck jesus with the palm of his hand saying answerest thou thehigh priest so   jesus answered him if i have spoken evil bearwitness of the evil but if well why smitest thou me   nowannas had sent him bound unto caiaphas the high priest and simon peter stood and warmed himself they said thereforeunto him art not thou also one of his disciples he denied it andsaid i am not one of the servants of the high priest being his kinsman whoseear peter cut off saith did not i see thee in the garden with him peter then denied again and immediately the cock crew then led they jesus from caiaphas unto the hall of judgment andit was early and they themselves went not into the judgment halllest they should be defiled but that they might eat the passover pilate then went out unto them and said what accusation bringye against this man   they answered and said unto him if hewere not a malefactor we would not have delivered him up unto thee then said pilate unto them take ye him and judge him accordingto your law the jews therefore said unto him it is not lawful for usto put any man to death  that the saying of jesus might befulfilled which he spake signifying what death he should die then pilate entered into the judgment hall again and calledjesus and said unto him art thou the king of the jews   jesusanswered him sayest thou this thing of thyself or did others tell itthee of me   pilate answered am i a jew thine own nation andthe chief priests have delivered thee unto me what hast thou done jesus answered my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdomwere of this world then would my servants fight that i should not bedelivered to the jews but now is my kingdom not from hence pilate therefore said unto him art thou a king then jesusanswered thou sayest that i am a king to this end was i born andfor this cause came i into the world that i should bear witness untothe truth every one that is of the truth heareth my voice pilate saith unto him what is truth and when he had said thishe went out again unto the jews and saith unto them i find in him nofault at all but ye have a custom that i should release unto you one at thepassover will ye therefore that i release unto you the king of thejews   then cried they all again saying not this man butbarabbas now barabbas was a robber then pilate therefore took jesus and scourged him and the soldiers platted a crown of thorns and put it on hishead and they put on him a purple robe  and said hail king ofthe jews and they smote him with their hands pilate therefore went forth again and saith unto them behold ibring him forth to you that ye may know that i find no fault in him then came jesus forth wearing the crown of thorns and thepurple robe and pilate saith unto them behold the man   whenthe chief priests therefore and officers saw him they cried outsaying crucify him crucify him pilate saith unto them take ye himand crucify him for i find no fault in him the jews answered him we have a law and by our law he ought todie because he made himself the son of god when pilate therefore heard that saying he was the more afraid and went again into the judgment hall and saith unto jesuswhence art thou but jesus gave him no answer then saith pilate unto him speakest thou not unto me knowestthou not that i have power to crucify thee and have power to releasethee   jesus answered thou couldest have no power at allagainst me except it were given thee from above therefore he thatdelivered me unto thee hath the greater sin and from thenceforth pilate sought to release him but the jewscried out saying if thou let this man go thou art not caesarsfriend whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against caesar when pilate therefore heard that saying he brought jesus forthand sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called thepavement but in the hebrew gabbatha and it was the preparation of the passover and about the sixthhour and he saith unto the jews behold your king   but theycried out away with him away with him crucify himpilate saith unto them shall i crucify your king the chief priestsanswered we have no king but caesar then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified andthey took jesus and led him away and he bearing his cross went forth into a place called theplace of a skull which is called in the hebrew golgotha  wherethey crucified him and two other with him on either side one andjesus in the midst and pilate wrote a title and put it on the cross and thewriting was jesus of nazareth the king of the jews this title then read many of the jews for the place where jesuswas crucified was nigh to the city and it was written in hebrew andgreek and latin then said the chief priests of the jews to pilate write notthe king of the jews but that he said i am king of the jews pilate answered what i have written i have written then the soldiers when they had crucified jesus took hisgarments and made four parts to every soldier a part and also hiscoat now the coat was without seam woven from the top throughout they said therefore among themselves let us not rend it butcast lots for it whose it shall be that the scripture might befulfilled which saith they parted my raiment among them and for myvesture they did cast lots these things therefore the soldiers did now there stood by the cross of jesus his mother and hismothers sister mary the wife of cleophas and mary magdalene when jesus therefore saw his mother and the disciple standingby whom he loved he saith unto his mother woman behold thy son then saith he to the disciple behold thy mother and from thathour that disciple took her unto his own home after this jesus knowing that all things were now accomplishedthat the scripture might be fulfilled saith i thirst now there was set a vessel full of vinegar and they filled aspunge with vinegar and put it upon hyssop and put it to his mouth when jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said it isfinished and he bowed his head and gave up the ghost the jews therefore because it was the preparation that thebodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day for thatsabbath day was an high day besought pilate that their legs might bebroken and that they might be taken away then came the soldiers and brake the legs of the first and ofthe other which was crucified with him but when they came to jesus and saw that he was dead alreadythey brake not his legs  but one of the soldiers with a spearpierced his side and forthwith came there out blood and water and he that saw it bare record and his record is true and heknoweth that he saith true that ye might believe for these things were done that the scripture should befulfilled a bone of him shall not be broken and again another scripture saith they shall look on him whomthey pierced and after this joseph of arimathaea being a disciple of jesusbut secretly for fear of the jews besought pilate that he might takeaway the body of jesus and pilate gave him leave he came thereforeand took the body of jesus and there came also nicodemus which at the first came to jesusby night and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes about an hundredpound weight then took they the body of jesus and wound it in linen clotheswith the spices as the manner of the jews is to bury now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden andin the garden a new sepulchre wherein was never man yet laid there laid they jesus therefore because of the jews preparationday for the sepulchre was nigh at hand the first day of the week cometh mary magdalene early when itwas yet dark unto the sepulchre and seeth the stone taken away fromthe sepulchre then she runneth and cometh to simon peter and to the otherdisciple whom jesus loved and saith unto them they have taken awaythe lord out of the sepulchre and we know not where they have laidhim peter therefore went forth and that other disciple and came tothe sepulchre so they ran both together and the other disciple did outrunpeter and came first to the sepulchre and he stooping down and looking in saw the linen clotheslying yet went he not in then cometh simon peter following him and went into thesepulchre and seeth the linen clothes lie  and the napkin thatwas about his head not lying with the linen clothes but wrappedtogether in a place by itself then went in also that other disciple which came first to thesepulchre and he saw and believed for as yet they knew not the scripture that he must rise againfrom the dead then the disciples went away again unto their own home but mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping and as shewept she stooped down and looked into the sepulchre  and seethtwo angels in white sitting the one at the head and the other at thefeet where the body of jesus had lain and they say unto her woman why weepest thou she saith untothem because they have taken away my lord and i know not where theyhave laid him and when she had thus said she turned herself back and sawjesus standing and knew not that it was jesus jesus saith unto her woman why weepest thou whom seekestthou  she supposing him to be the gardener saith unto him sir ifthou have borne him hence tell me where thou hast laid him and iwill take him away jesus saith unto her mary she turned herself and saith untohim rabboni which is to say master jesus saith unto her touch me not for i am not yet ascended tomy father but go to my brethren and say unto them i ascend unto myfather and your father and to my god and your god mary magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen thelord and that he had spoken these things unto her then the same day at evening being the first day of the weekwhen the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fearof the jews came jesus and stood in the midst and saith unto thempeace be unto you and when he had so said he shewed unto them his hands and hissidethen were the disciples glad when they saw the lord then said jesus to them again peace be unto you as my fatherhath sent me even so send i you and when he had said this he breathed on them and saith untothem receive ye the holy ghost  whose soever sins ye remitthey are remitted unto them and whose soever sins ye retain they areretained but thomas one of the twelve called didymus was not with themwhen jesus came the other disciples therefore said unto him we have seen thelordbut he said unto them except i shall see in his hands the print ofthe nails and put my finger into the print of the nails and thrustmy hand into his side i will not believe and after eight days again his disciples were within and thomaswith them then came jesus the doors being shut and stood in themidst and said peace be unto you then saith he to thomas reach hither thy finger and behold myhands and reach hither thy hand and thrust it into my side and benot faithless but believing and thomas answered and said unto him my lord and my god jesus saith unto him thomas because thou hast seen me thouhast believed blessed are they that have not seen and yet havebelieved and many other signs truly did jesus in the presence of hisdisciples which are not written in this book  but these arewritten that ye might believe that jesus is the christ the son ofgod and that believing ye might have life through his name after these things jesus shewed himself again to the disciples atthe sea of tiberias and on this wise shewed he himself there were together simon peter and thomas called didymus andnathanael of cana in galilee and the sons of zebedee and two otherof his disciples simon peter saith unto them i go a fishing they say unto himwe also go with thee they went forth and entered into a shipimmediately and that night they caught nothing but when the morning was now come jesus stood on the shore butthe disciples knew not that it was jesus then jesus saith unto them children have ye any meat theyanswered him no and he said unto them cast the net on the right side of theship and ye shall find they cast therefore and now they were notable to draw it for the multitude of fishes therefore that disciple whom jesus loved saith unto peter it isthe lord now when simon peter heard that it was the lord he girt hisfishers coat unto him for he was naked and did cast himself intothe sea and the other disciples came in a little ship for they were notfar from land but as it were two hundred cubits dragging the netwith fishes as soon then as they were come to land they saw a fire of coalsthere and fish laid thereon and bread jesus saith unto them bring of the fish which ye have nowcaught simon peter went up and drew the net to land full of greatfishes an hundred and fifty and three and for all there were somany yet was not the net broken jesus saith unto them come and dine and none of the disciplesdurst ask him who art thou knowing that it was the lord jesus then cometh and taketh bread and giveth them and fishlikewise this is now the third time that jesus shewed himself to hisdisciples after that he was risen from the dead so when they had dined jesus saith to simon peter simon sonof jonas lovest thou me more than these he saith unto him yealord thou knowest that i love thee he saith unto him feed my lambs he saith to him again the second time simon son of jonaslovest thou me he saith unto him yea lord thou knowest that i lovethee he saith unto him feed my sheep he saith unto him the third time simon son of jonas lovestthou me peter was grieved because he said unto him the third timelovest thou me and he said unto him lord thou knowest all thingsthou knowest that i love thee jesus saith unto him feed my sheep verily verily i say unto thee when thou wast young thougirdest thyself and walkedst whither thou wouldest but when thoushalt be old thou shalt stretch forth thy hands and another shallgird thee and carry thee whither thou wouldest not this spake he signifying by what death he should glorify godand when he had spoken this he saith unto him follow me then peter turning about seeth the disciple whom jesus lovedfollowing which also leaned on his breast at supper and said lordwhich is he that betrayeth thee   peter seeing him saith tojesus lord and what shall this man do   jesus saith unto himif i will that he tarry till i come what is that to thee follow thoume then went this saying abroad among the brethren that thatdisciple should not die yet jesus said not unto him he shall notdie but if i will that he tarry till i come what is that to thee this is the disciple which testifieth of these things and wrotethese things and we know that his testimony is true and there are also many other things which jesus did the whichif they should be written every one i suppose that even the worlditself could not contain the books that should be written amenthe acts of the apostles the former treatise have i made o theophilus of all that jesusbegan both to do and teach  until the day in which he was takenup after that he through the holy ghost had given commandments untothe apostles whom he had chosen  to whom also he shewed himselfalive after his passion by many infallible proofs being seen of themforty days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom ofgod  and being assembled together with them commanded them thatthey should not depart from jerusalem but wait for the promise of thefather which saith he ye have heard of me for john truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized withthe holy ghost not many days hence when they therefore were come together they asked of him sayinglord wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to israel  and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times or theseasons which the father hath put in his own power but ye shall receive power after that the holy ghost is come uponyou and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem and in alljudaea and in samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth and when he had spoken these things while they beheld he wastaken up and a cloud received him out of their sight and while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went upbehold two men stood by them in white apparel  which also saidye men of galilee why stand ye gazing up into heaven this samejesus which is taken up from you into heaven shall so come in likemanner as ye have seen him go into heaven then returned they unto jerusalem from the mount called olivetwhich is from jerusalem a sabbath days journey and when they were come in they went up into an upper roomwhere abode both peter and james and john and andrew philip andthomas bartholomew and matthew james the son of alphaeus and simonzelotes and judas the brother of james these all continued with one accord in prayer and supplicationwith the women and mary the mother of jesus and with his brethren and in those days peter stood up in the midst of the disciplesand said the number of names together were about an hundred andtwenty  men and brethren this scripture must needs have beenfulfilled which the holy ghost by the mouth of david spake beforeconcerning judas which was guide to them that took jesus for he was numbered with us and had obtained part of thisministry now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity andfalling headlong he burst asunder in the midst and all his bowelsgushed out and it was known unto all the dwellers at jerusalem insomuch asthat field is called in their proper tongue aceldama that is to saythe field of blood for it is written in the book of psalms let his habitation bedesolate and let no man dwell therein and his bishoprick let anothertake wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the timethat the lord jesus went in and out among us  beginning from thebaptism of john unto that same day that he was taken up from us mustone be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection and they appointed two joseph called barsabas who was surnamedjustus and matthias and they prayed and said thou lord which knowest the heartsof all men shew whether of these two thou hast chosen  that hemay take part of this ministry and apostleship from which judas bytransgression fell that he might go to his own place and they gave forth their lots and the lot fell upon matthiasand he was numbered with the eleven apostles and when the day of pentecost was fully come they were all withone accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mightywind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire andit sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speakwith other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance and there were dwelling at jerusalem jews devout men out ofevery nation under heaven now when this was noised abroad the multitude came together andwere confounded because that every man heard them speak in his ownlanguage and they were all amazed and marvelled saying one to anotherbehold are not all these which speak galilaeans   and how hear weevery man in our own tongue wherein we were born   parthians andmedes and elamites and the dwellers in mesopotamia and in judaeaand cappadocia in pontus and asia  phrygia and pamphylia inegypt and in the parts of libya about cyrene and strangers of romejews and proselytes  cretes and arabians we do hear them speakin our tongues the wonderful works of god and they were all amazed and were in doubt saying one toanother what meaneth this   others mocking said these men arefull of new wine but peter standing up with the eleven lifted up his voice andsaid unto them ye men of judaea and all ye that dwell at jerusalembe this known unto you and hearken to my words  for these arenot drunken as ye suppose seeing it is but the third hour of theday but this is that which was spoken by the prophet joel  andit shall come to pass in the last days saith god i will pour out ofmy spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shallprophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shalldream dreams  and on my servants and on my handmaidens i willpour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy  andi will shew wonders in heaven above and signs in the earth beneathblood and fire and vapour of smoke  the sun shall be turnedinto darkness and the moon into blood before the great and notableday of the lord come  and it shall come to pass that whosoevershall call on the name of the lord shall be saved ye men of israel hear these words jesus of nazareth a manapproved of god among you by miracles and wonders and signs which goddid by him in the midst of you as ye yourselves also know  himbeing delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of godye have taken and by wicked hands have crucified and slain  whomgod hath raised up having loosed the pains of death because it wasnot possible that he should be holden of it for david speaketh concerning him i foresaw the lord alwaysbefore my face for he is on my right hand that i should not bemoved  therefore did my heart rejoice and my tongue was gladmoreover also my flesh shall rest in hope  because thou wilt notleave my soul in hell neither wilt thou suffer thine holy one to seecorruption thou hast made known to me the ways of life thou shalt make mefull of joy with thy countenance men and brethren let me freely speak unto you of the patriarchdavid that he is both dead and buried and his sepulchre is with usunto this day therefore being a prophet and knowing that god had sworn with anoath to him that of the fruit of his loins according to the fleshhe would raise up christ to sit on his throne  he seeing thisbefore spake of the resurrection of christ that his soul was not leftin hell neither his flesh did see corruption this jesus hath god raised up whereof we all are witnesses therefore being by the right hand of god exalted and havingreceived of the father the promise of the holy ghost he hath shedforth this which ye now see and hear for david is not ascended into the heavens but he saith himselfthe lord said unto my lord sit thou on my right hand  until imake thy foes thy footstool therefore let all the house of israel know assuredly that godhath made the same jesus whom ye have crucified both lord andchrist now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart andsaid unto peter and to the rest of the apostles men and brethrenwhat shall we do   then peter said unto them repent and bebaptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for theremission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promise is unto you and to your children and to allthat are afar off even as many as the lord our god shall call and with many other words did he testify and exhort saying saveyourselves from this untoward generation then they that gladly received his word were baptized and thesame day there were added unto them about three thousand souls and they continued stedfastly in the apostles doctrine andfellowship and in breaking of bread and in prayers and fear came upon every soul and many wonders and signs weredone by the apostles and all that believed were together and had all things common and sold their possessions and goods and parted them to all menas every man had need and they continuing daily with one accord in the temple andbreaking bread from house to house did eat their meat with gladnessand singleness of heart  praising god and having favour with allthe people and the lord added to the church daily such as should besaved now peter and john went up together into the temple at the hour ofprayer being the ninth hour and a certain man lame from his mothers womb was carried whomthey laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called beautifulto ask alms of them that entered into the temple  who seeing peterand john about to go into the temple asked an alms and peter fastening his eyes upon him with john said look onus and he gave heed unto them expecting to receive something ofthem then peter said silver and gold have i none but such as i havegive i thee in the name of jesus christ of nazareth rise up and walk and he took him by the right hand and lifted him up andimmediately his feet and ankle bones received strength and he leaping up stood and walked and entered with them intothe temple walking and leaping and praising god and all the people saw him walking and praising god  and theyknew that it was he which sat for alms at the beautiful gate of thetemple and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that whichhad happened unto him and as the lame man which was healed held peter and john all thepeople ran together unto them in the porch that is called solomonsgreatly wondering and when peter saw it he answered unto the people ye men ofisrael why marvel ye at this or why look ye so earnestly on us asthough by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk the god of abraham and of isaac and of jacob the god of ourfathers hath glorified his son jesus whom ye delivered up anddenied him in the presence of pilate when he was determined to lethim go but ye denied the holy one and the just and desired a murdererto be granted unto you  and killed the prince of life whom godhath raised from the dead whereof we are witnesses and his name through faith in his name hath made this man strongwhom ye see and know yea the faith which is by him hath given himthis perfect soundness in the presence of you all and now brethren i wot that through ignorance ye did it as didalso your rulers but those things which god before had shewed by the mouth of allhis prophets that christ should suffer he hath so fulfilled repent ye therefore and be converted that your sins may beblotted out when the times of refreshing shall come from the presenceof the lord and he shall send jesus christ which before was preached untoyou  whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitutionof all things which god hath spoken by the mouth of all his holyprophets since the world began for moses truly said unto the fathers a prophet shall the lordyour god raise up unto you of your brethren like unto me him shallye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you and it shall come to pass that every soul which will not hearthat prophet shall be destroyed from among the people yea and all the prophets from samuel and those that followafter as many as have spoken have likewise foretold of these days ye are the children of the prophets and of the covenant whichgod made with our fathers saying unto abraham and in thy seed shallall the kindreds of the earth be blessed unto you first god having raised up his son jesus sent him tobless you in turning away every one of you from his iniquities and as they spake unto the people the priests and the captain ofthe temple and the sadducees came upon them  being grieved thatthey taught the people and preached through jesus the resurrectionfrom the dead and they laid hands on them and put them in hold unto the nextday for it was now eventide howbeit many of them which heard the word believed and the numberof the men was about five thousand and it came to pass on the morrow that their rulers and eldersand scribes  and annas the high priest and caiaphas and johnand alexander and as many as were of the kindred of the high priestwere gathered together at jerusalem and when they had set them in the midst they asked by whatpower or by what name have ye done this   then peter filledwith the holy ghost said unto them ye rulers of the people andelders of israel  if we this day be examined of the good deed doneto the impotent man by what means he is made whole  be it knownunto you all and to all the people of israel that by the name ofjesus christ of nazareth whom ye crucified whom god raised from thedead even by him doth this man stand here before you whole this is the stone which was set at nought of you builders whichis become the head of the corner neither is there salvation in any other for there is none othername under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved now when they saw the boldness of peter and john and perceivedthat they were unlearned and ignorant men they marvelled and theytook knowledge of them that they had been with jesus and beholding the man which was healed standing with them theycould say nothing against it but when they had commanded them to go aside out of the councilthey conferred among themselves  saying what shall we do tothese men for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them ismanifest to all them that dwell in jerusalem and we cannot deny it but that it spread no further among the people let us straitlythreaten them that they speak henceforth to no man in this name and they called them and commanded them not to speak at all norteach in the name of jesus but peter and john answered and said unto them whether it beright in the sight of god to hearken unto you more than unto godjudge ye for we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard so when they had further threatened them they let them gofinding nothing how they might punish them because of the people forall men glorified god for that which was done for the man was above forty years old on whom this miracle ofhealing was shewed and being let go they went to their own company and reportedall that the chief priests and elders had said unto them and when they heard that they lifted up their voice to god withone accord and said lord thou art god which hast made heaven andearth and the sea and all that in them is  who by the mouth ofthy servant david hast said why did the heathen rage and the peopleimagine vain things   the kings of the earth stood up and therulers were gathered together against the lord and against hischrist for of a truth against thy holy child jesus whom thou hastanointed both herod and pontius pilate with the gentiles and thepeople of israel were gathered together  for to do whatsoeverthy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done and now lord behold their threatenings and grant unto thyservants that with all boldness they may speak thy word  bystretching forth thine hand to heal and that signs and wonders may bedone by the name of thy holy child jesus and when they had prayed the place was shaken where they wereassembled together and they were all filled with the holy ghost andthey spake the word of god with boldness and the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and ofone soul neither said any of them that ought of the things which hepossessed was his own but they had all things common and with great power gave the apostles witness of theresurrection of the lord jesus and great grace was upon them all neither was there any among them that lacked for as many as werepossessors of lands or houses sold them and brought the prices of thethings that were sold  and laid them down at the apostles feetand distribution was made unto every man according as he had need and joses who by the apostles was surnamed barnabas which isbeing interpreted the son of consolation a levite and of thecountry of cyprus  having land sold it and brought the moneyand laid it at the apostles feet but a certain man named ananias with sapphira his wife sold apossession  and kept back part of the price his wife also beingprivy to it and brought a certain part and laid it at the apostlesfeet but peter said ananias why hath satan filled thine heart to lieto the holy ghost and to keep back part of the price of the land whiles it remained was it not thine own and after it was soldwas it not in thine own power why hast thou conceived this thing inthine heart  thou hast not lied unto men but unto god and ananias hearing these words fell down and gave up the ghostand great fear came on all them that heard these things and the young men arose wound him up and carried him out andburied him and it was about the space of three hours after when his wifenot knowing what was done came in and peter answered unto her tell me whether ye sold the land forso much and she said yea for so much then peter said unto her how is it that ye have agreed togetherto tempt the spirit of the lord behold the feet of them which haveburied thy husband are at the door and shall carry thee out then fell she down straightway at his feet and yielded up theghost and the young men came in and found her dead and carryingher forth buried her by her husband and great fear came upon all the church and upon as many asheard these things and by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonderswrought among the people and they were all with one accord insolomons porch and of the rest durst no man join himself to them but the peoplemagnified them and believers were the more added to the lord multitudes both ofmen and women   insomuch that they brought forth the sick intothe streets and laid them on beds and couches that at the least theshadow of peter passing by might overshadow some of them there came also a multitude out of the cities round about untojerusalem bringing sick folks and them which were vexed with uncleanspirits and they were healed every one then the high priest rose up and all they that were with himwhich is the sect of the sadducees and were filled withindignation  and laid their hands on the apostles and put themin the common prison but the angel of the lord by night opened the prison doors andbrought them forth and said  go stand and speak in the templeto the people all the words of this life and when they heard that they entered into the temple early inthe morning and taught but the high priest came and they that werewith him and called the council together and all the senate of thechildren of israel and sent to the prison to have them brought but when the officers came and found them not in the prisonthey returned and told  saying the prison truly found we shutwith all safety and the keepers standing without before the doorsbut when we had opened we found no man within now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and thechief priests heard these things they doubted of them whereunto thiswould grow then came one and told them saying behold the men whom ye putin prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people then went the captain with the officers and brought them withoutviolence for they feared the people lest they should have beenstoned and when they had brought them they set them before the counciland the high priest asked them  saying did not we straitlycommand you that ye should not teach in this name and behold yehave filled jerusalem with your doctrine and intend to bring thismans blood upon us then peter and the other apostles answered and said we ought toobey god rather than men the god of our fathers raised up jesus whom ye slew and hangedon a tree him hath god exalted with his right hand to be a prince and asaviour for to give repentance to israel and forgiveness of sins and we are his witnesses of these things and so is also the holyghost whom god hath given to them that obey him when they heard that they were cut to the heart and tookcounsel to slay them then stood there up one in the council a pharisee namedgamaliel a doctor of the law had in reputation among all the peopleand commanded to put the apostles forth a little space  and saidunto them ye men of israel take heed to yourselves what ye intend todo as touching these men for before these days rose up theudas boasting himself to besomebody to whom a number of men about four hundred joinedthemselves who was slain and all as many as obeyed him werescattered and brought to nought after this man rose up judas of galilee in the days of thetaxing and drew away much people after him he also perished andall even as many as obeyed him were dispersed and now i say unto you refrain from these men and let themalone for if this counsel or this work be of men it will come tonought  but if it be of god ye cannot overthrow it lest haplyye be found even to fight against god and to him they agreed and when they had called the apostlesand beaten them they commanded that they should not speak in the nameof jesus and let them go and they departed from the presence of the council rejoicingthat they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name and daily in the temple and in every house they ceased not toteach and preach jesus christ and in those days when the number of the disciples wasmultiplied there arose a murmuring of the grecians against thehebrews because their widows were neglected in the dailyministration then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto themand said it is not reason that we should leave the word of god andserve tables wherefore brethren look ye out among you seven men of honestreport full of the holy ghost and wisdom whom we may appoint overthis business but we will give ourselves continually to prayer and to theministry of the word and the saying pleased the whole multitude and they chosestephen a man full of faith and of the holy ghost and philip andprochorus and nicanor and timon and parmenas and nicolas aproselyte of antioch  whom they set before the apostles and whenthey had prayed they laid their hands on them and the word of god increased and the number of the disciplesmultiplied in jerusalem greatly and a great company of the priestswere obedient to the faith and stephen full of faith and power did great wonders andmiracles among the people then there arose certain of the synagogue which is called thesynagogue of the libertines and cyrenians and alexandrians and ofthem of cilicia and of asia disputing with stephen and they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit bywhich he spake then they suborned men which said we have heard him speakblasphemous words against moses and against god and they stirred up the people and the elders and the scribesand came upon him and caught him and brought him to the council and set up false witnesses which said this man ceaseth not tospeak blasphemous words against this holy place and the law  forwe have heard him say that this jesus of nazareth shall destroy thisplace and shall change the customs which moses delivered us and all that sat in the council looking stedfastly on him sawhis face as it had been the face of an angel then said the high priest are these things so   and he saidmen brethren and fathers hearken the god of glory appeared untoour father abraham when he was in mesopotamia before he dwelt incharran  and said unto him get thee out of thy country and fromthy kindred and come into the land which i shall shew thee then came he out of the land of the chaldaeans and dwelt incharran and from thence when his father was dead he removed himinto this land wherein ye now dwell and he gave him none inheritance in it no not so much as to sethis foot on yet he promised that he would give it to him for apossession and to his seed after him when as yet he had no child and god spake on this wise that his seed should sojourn in astrange land and that they should bring them into bondage andentreat them evil four hundred years and the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will i judge saidgod and after that shall they come forth and serve me in this place and he gave him the covenant of circumcision and so abraham begatisaac and circumcised him the eighth day and isaac begat jacob andjacob begat the twelve patriarchs and the patriarchs moved with envy sold joseph into egypt butgod was with him  and delivered him out of all his afflictionsand gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of pharaoh king of egyptand he made him governor over egypt and all his house now there came a dearth over all the land of egypt and chanaanand great affliction and our fathers found no sustenance but when jacob heard that there was corn in egypt he sent outour fathers first and at the second time joseph was made known to his brethren andjosephs kindred was made known unto pharaoh then sent joseph and called his father jacob to him and all hiskindred threescore and fifteen souls so jacob went down into egypt and died he and our fathers and were carried over into sychem and laid in the sepulchre thatabraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of emmor the father ofsychem but when the time of the promise drew nigh which god had swornto abraham the people grew and multiplied in egypt  till anotherking arose which knew not joseph the same dealt subtilly with our kindred and evil entreated ourfathers so that they cast out their young children to the end theymight not live in which time moses was born and was exceeding fair andnourished up in his fathers house three months  and when he wascast out pharaohs daughter took him up and nourished him for herown son and moses was learned in all the wisdom of the egyptians and wasmighty in words and in deeds and when he was full forty years old it came into his heart tovisit his brethren the children of israel and seeing one of them suffer wrong he defended him and avengedhim that was oppressed and smote the egyptian  for he supposedhis brethren would have understood how that god by his hand woulddeliver them but they understood not and the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove andwould have set them at one again saying sirs ye are brethren whydo ye wrong one to another   but he that did his neighbour wrongthrust him away saying who made thee a ruler and a judge over us wilt thou kill me as thou diddest the egyptian yesterday  then fled moses at this saying and was a stranger in the land ofmadian where he begat two sons and when forty years were expired there appeared to him in thewilderness of mount sina an angel of the lord in a flame of fire in abush when moses saw it he wondered at the sight and as he drew nearto behold it the voice of the lord came unto him  saying i amthe god of thy fathers the god of abraham and the god of isaac andthe god of jacob then moses trembled and durst not behold then said the lord to him put off thy shoes from thy feet forthe place where thou standest is holy ground i have seen i have seen the affliction of my people which is inegypt and i have heard their groaning and am come down to deliverthem and now come i will send thee into egypt this moses whom they refused saying who made thee a ruler and ajudge the same did god send to be a ruler and a deliverer by the handof the angel which appeared to him in the bush he brought them out after that he had shewed wonders and signsin the land of egypt and in the red sea and in the wilderness fortyyears this is that moses which said unto the children of israel aprophet shall the lord your god raise up unto you of your brethrenlike unto me him shall ye hear this is he that was in the church in the wilderness with theangel which spake to him in the mount sina and with our fathers whoreceived the lively oracles to give unto us  to whom our fatherswould not obey but thrust him from them and in their hearts turnedback again into egypt  saying unto aaron make us gods to gobefore us for as for this moses which brought us out of the land ofegypt we wot not what is become of him and they made a calf in those days and offered sacrifice untothe idol and rejoiced in the works of their own hands then god turned and gave them up to worship the host of heavenas it is written in the book of the prophets o ye house of israelhave ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space offorty years in the wilderness   yea ye took up the tabernacle ofmoloch and the star of your god remphan figures which ye made toworship them and i will carry you away beyond babylon our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness ashe had appointed speaking unto moses that he should make itaccording to the fashion that he had seen which also our fathers that came after brought in with jesus intothe possession of the gentiles whom god drave out before the face ofour fathers unto the days of david  who found favour before godand desired to find a tabernacle for the god of jacob but solomon built him an house howbeit the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands assaith the prophet  heaven is my throne and earth is myfootstool what house will ye build me saith the lord or what is theplace of my rest   hath not my hand made all these things  ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears ye do alwaysresist the holy ghost as your fathers did so do ye which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted and theyhave slain them which shewed before of the coming of the just one ofwhom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers  who havereceived the law by the disposition of angels and have not kept it when they heard these things they were cut to the heart andthey gnashed on him with their teeth but he being full of the holy ghost looked up stedfastly intoheaven and saw the glory of god and jesus standing on the right handof god  and said behold i see the heavens opened and the sonof man standing on the right hand of god then they cried out with a loud voice and stopped their earsand ran upon him with one accord  and cast him out of the cityand stoned him and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a youngmans feet whose name was saul and they stoned stephen calling upon god and saying lordjesus receive my spirit and he kneeled down and cried with a loud voice lord lay notthis sin to their charge and when he had said this he fell asleep and saul was consenting unto his death and at that time there wasa great persecution against the church which was at jerusalem andthey were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of judaea andsamaria except the apostles and devout men carried stephen to his burial and made greatlamentation over him as for saul he made havock of the church entering into everyhouse and haling men and women committed them to prison therefore they that were scattered abroad went every wherepreaching the word then philip went down to the city of samaria and preached christunto them and the people with one accord gave heed unto those things whichphilip spake hearing and seeing the miracles which he did for unclean spirits crying with loud voice came out of many thatwere possessed with them and many taken with palsies and that werelame were healed and there was great joy in that city but there was a certain man called simon which beforetime in thesame city used sorcery and bewitched the people of samaria givingout that himself was some great one  to whom they all gave heedfrom the least to the greatest saying this man is the great power ofgod and to him they had regard because that of long time he hadbewitched them with sorceries but when they believed philip preaching the things concerning thekingdom of god and the name of jesus christ they were baptized bothmen and women then simon himself believed also and when he was baptized hecontinued with philip and wondered beholding the miracles and signswhich were done now when the apostles which were at jerusalem heard that samariahad received the word of god they sent unto them peter and john who when they were come down prayed for them that they mightreceive the holy ghost  for as yet he was fallen upon none ofthem only they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus  then laid they their hands on them and they received the holy ghost and when simon saw that through laying on of the apostles handsthe holy ghost was given he offered them money  saying give mealso this power that on whomsoever i lay hands he may receive theholy ghost but peter said unto him thy money perish with thee because thouhast thought that the gift of god may be purchased with money thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter for thy heart isnot right in the sight of god repent therefore of this thy wickedness and pray god if perhapsthe thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee for i perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness and inthe bond of iniquity then answered simon and said pray ye to the lord for me thatnone of these things which ye have spoken come upon me and they when they had testified and preached the word of thelord returned to jerusalem and preached the gospel in many villagesof the samaritans and the angel of the lord spake unto philip saying arise andgo toward the south unto the way that goeth down from jerusalem untogaza which is desert and he arose and went and behold a man of ethiopia an eunuchof great authority under candace queen of the ethiopians who had thecharge of all her treasure and had come to jerusalem for to worship was returning and sitting in his chariot read esaias theprophet then the spirit said unto philip go near and join thyself tothis chariot and philip ran thither to him and heard him read the prophetesaias and said understandest thou what thou readest   and hesaid how can i except some man should guide me and he desiredphilip that he would come up and sit with him the place of the scripture which he read was this he was led asa sheep to the slaughter and like a lamb dumb before his shearer soopened he not his mouth  in his humiliation his judgment wastaken away and who shall declare his generation for his life istaken from the earth and the eunuch answered philip and said i pray thee of whomspeaketh the prophet this of himself or of some other man  then philip opened his mouth and began at the same scripture andpreached unto him jesus and as they went on their way they came unto a certain waterand the eunuch said see here is water what doth hinder me to bebaptized   and philip said if thou believest with all thineheart thou mayestand he answered and said i believe that jesus christ is the son ofgod and he commanded the chariot to stand still and they went downboth into the water both philip and the eunuch and he baptized him and when they were come up out of the water the spirit of thelord caught away philip that the eunuch saw him no more and he wenton his way rejoicing but philip was found at azotus and passing through he preachedin all the cities till he came to caesarea and saul yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against thedisciples of the lord went unto the high priest  and desired ofhim letters to damascus to the synagogues that if he found any ofthis way whether they were men or women he might bring them boundunto jerusalem and as he journeyed he came near damascus and suddenly thereshined round about him a light from heaven  and he fell to theearth and heard a voice saying unto him saul saul why persecutestthou me   and he said who art thou lord and the lord said i amjesus whom thou persecutest it is hard for thee to kick against thepricks and he trembling and astonished said lord what wilt thou have meto do and the lord said unto him arise and go into the city and itshall be told thee what thou must do and the men which journeyed with him stood speechless hearing avoice but seeing no man and saul arose from the earth and when his eyes were opened hesaw no man but they led him by the hand and brought him intodamascus and he was three days without sight and neither did eat nordrink and there was a certain disciple at damascus named ananias andto him said the lord in a vision ananias and he said behold i amhere lord and the lord said unto him arise and go into the street whichis called straight and enquire in the house of judas for one calledsaul of tarsus for behold he prayeth  and hath seen in avision a man named ananias coming in and putting his hand on himthat he might receive his sight then ananias answered lord i have heard by many of this manhow much evil he hath done to thy saints at jerusalem  and herehe hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thyname but the lord said unto him go thy way for he is a chosen vesselunto me to bear my name before the gentiles and kings and thechildren of israel  for i will shew him how great things he mustsuffer for my names sake and ananias went his way and entered into the house and puttinghis hands on him said brother saul the lord even jesus thatappeared unto thee in the way as thou camest hath sent me that thoumightest receive thy sight and be filled with the holy ghost and immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scalesand he received sight forthwith and arose and was baptized and when he had received meat he was strengthened then was saulcertain days with the disciples which were at damascus and straightway he preached christ in the synagogues that he isthe son of god but all that heard him were amazed and said is not this he thatdestroyed them which called on this name in jerusalem and came hitherfor that intent that he might bring them bound unto the chiefpriests   but saul increased the more in strength and confoundedthe jews which dwelt at damascus proving that this is very christ and after that many days were fulfilled the jews took counsel tokill him  but their laying await was known of saul and theywatched the gates day and night to kill him then the disciples took him by night and let him down by thewall in a basket and when saul was come to jerusalem he assayed to join himselfto the disciples but they were all afraid of him and believed notthat he was a disciple but barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles anddeclared unto them how he had seen the lord in the way and that hehad spoken to him and how he had preached boldly at damascus in thename of jesus and he was with them coming in and going out at jerusalem and he spake boldly in the name of the lord jesus and disputedagainst the grecians but they went about to slay him which when the brethren knew they brought him down to caesareaand sent him forth to tarsus then had the churches rest throughout all judaea and galilee andsamaria and were edified and walking in the fear of the lord and inthe comfort of the holy ghost were multiplied and it came to pass as peter passed throughout all quarters hecame down also to the saints which dwelt at lydda and there he found a certain man named aeneas which had kept hisbed eight years and was sick of the palsy and peter said unto him aeneas jesus christ maketh thee wholearise and make thy bed and he arose immediately and all that dwelt at lydda and saron saw him and turned to thelord now there was at joppa a certain disciple named tabitha which byinterpretation is called dorcas this woman was full of good works andalmsdeeds which she did and it came to pass in those days that she was sick and diedwhom when they had washed they laid her in an upper chamber and forasmuch as lydda was nigh to joppa and the disciples hadheard that peter was there they sent unto him two men desiring himthat he would not delay to come to them then peter arose and went with them when he was come theybrought him into the upper chamber and all the widows stood by himweeping and shewing the coats and garments which dorcas made whileshe was with them but peter put them all forth and kneeled down and prayed andturning him to the body said tabitha arise and she opened her eyesand when she saw peter she sat up and he gave her his hand and lifted her up and when he hadcalled the saints and widows presented her alive and it was known throughout all joppa and many believed in thelord and it came to pass that he tarried many days in joppa with onesimon a tanner there was a certain man in caesarea called cornelius a centurionof the band called the italian band  a devout man and one thatfeared god with all his house which gave much alms to the people andprayed to god alway he saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day anangel of god coming in to him and saying unto him cornelius and when he looked on him he was afraid and said what is itlord  and he said unto him thy prayers and thine alms are come upfor a memorial before god and now send men to joppa and call for one simon whose surnameis peter  he lodgeth with one simon a tanner whose house is bythe sea side he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do and when the angel which spake unto cornelius was departed hecalled two of his household servants and a devout soldier of themthat waited on him continually  and when he had declared allthese things unto them he sent them to joppa on the morrow as they went on their journey and drew nigh untothe city peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixthhour  and he became very hungry and would have eaten but whilethey made ready he fell into a trance  and saw heaven openedand a certain vessel descending upon him as it had been a great sheetknit at the four corners and let down to the earth  whereinwere all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth and wild beastsand creeping things and fowls of the air and there came a voice to him rise peter kill and eat but peter said not so lord for i have never eaten any thingthat is common or unclean and the voice spake unto him again the second time what godhath cleansed that call not thou common this was done thrice and the vessel was received up again intoheaven now while peter doubted in himself what this vision which he hadseen should mean behold the men which were sent from cornelius hadmade enquiry for simons house and stood before the gate  andcalled and asked whether simon which was surnamed peter were lodgedthere while peter thought on the vision the spirit said unto himbehold three men seek thee arise therefore and get thee down and go with them doubtingnothing for i have sent them then peter went down to the men which were sent unto him fromcornelius and said behold i am he whom ye seek what is the causewherefore ye are come   and they said cornelius the centuriona just man and one that feareth god and of good report among all thenation of the jews was warned from god by an holy angel to send forthee into his house and to hear words of thee then called he them in and lodged them and on the morrow peterwent away with them and certain brethren from joppa accompanied him and the morrow after they entered into caesarea and corneliuswaited for them and he had called together his kinsmen and nearfriends and as peter was coming in cornelius met him and fell down athis feet and worshipped him but peter took him up saying stand up i myself also am a man and as he talked with him he went in and found many that werecome together and he said unto them ye know how that it is an unlawful thingfor a man that is a jew to keep company or come unto one of anothernation but god hath shewed me that i should not call any man commonor unclean therefore came i unto you without gainsaying as soon as i wassent for i ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me  and cornelius said four days ago i was fasting until this hour andat the ninth hour i prayed in my house and behold a man stoodbefore me in bright clothing  and said cornelius thy prayer isheard and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of god send therefore to joppa and call hither simon whose surname ispeter he is lodged in the house of one simon a tanner by the seaside who when he cometh shall speak unto thee immediately therefore i sent to thee and thou hast well donethat thou art come now therefore are we all here present before godto hear all things that are commanded thee of god then peter opened his mouth and said of a truth i perceivethat god is no respecter of persons  but in every nation he thatfeareth him and worketh righteousness is accepted with him the word which god sent unto the children of israel preachingpeace by jesus christ he is lord of all  that word i say yeknow which was published throughout all judaea and began fromgalilee after the baptism which john preached  how god anointedjesus of nazareth with the holy ghost and with power who went aboutdoing good and healing all that were oppressed of the devil for godwas with him and we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the landof the jews and in jerusalem whom they slew and hanged on a tree him god raised up the third day and shewed him openly not to all the people but unto witnesses chosen before god even tous who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead and he commanded us to preach unto the people and to testifythat it is he which was ordained of god to be the judge of quick anddead to him give all the prophets witness that through his namewhosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins while peter yet spake these words the holy ghost fell on allthem which heard the word and they of the circumcision which believed were astonished asmany as came with peter because that on the gentiles also was pouredout the gift of the holy ghost for they heard them speak with tongues and magnify god thenanswered peter  can any man forbid water that these should notbe baptized which have received the holy ghost as well as we  and he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the lord thenprayed they him to tarry certain days and the apostles and brethren that were in judaea heard that thegentiles had also received the word of god and when peter was come up to jerusalem they that were of thecircumcision contended with him  saying thou wentest in to menuncircumcised and didst eat with them but peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning and expoundedit by order unto them saying  i was in the city of joppapraying and in a trance i saw a vision a certain vessel descend asit had been a great sheet let down from heaven by four corners andit came even to me  upon the which when i had fastened mine eyesi considered and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth and wild beastsand creeping things and fowls of the air and i heard a voice saying unto me arise peter slay and eat but i said not so lord for nothing common or unclean hath atany time entered into my mouth but the voice answered me again from heaven what god hathcleansed that call not thou common and this was done three times and all were drawn up again intoheaven and behold immediately there were three men already come untothe house where i was sent from caesarea unto me and the spirit bade me go with them nothing doubting moreoverthese six brethren accompanied me and we entered into the manshouse  and he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his housewhich stood and said unto him send men to joppa and call for simonwhose surname is peter  who shall tell thee words whereby thouand all thy house shall be saved and as i began to speak the holy ghost fell on them as on usat the beginning then remembered i the word of the lord how that he said johnindeed baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the holyghost forasmuch then as god gave them the like gift as he did unto uswho believed on the lord jesus christ what was i that i couldwithstand god   when they heard these things they held theirpeace and glorified god saying then hath god also to the gentilesgranted repentance unto life now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution thatarose about stephen travelled as far as phenice and cyprus andantioch preaching the word to none but unto the jews only and some of them were men of cyprus and cyrene which when theywere come to antioch spake unto the grecians preaching the lordjesus and the hand of the lord was with them and a great numberbelieved and turned unto the lord then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the churchwhich was in jerusalem and they sent forth barnabas that he shouldgo as far as antioch who when he came and had seen the grace of god was glad andexhorted them all that with purpose of heart they would cleave untothe lord for he was a good man and full of the holy ghost and of faithand much people was added unto the lord then departed barnabas to tarsus for to seek saul  andwhen he had found him he brought him unto antioch and it came topass that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church andtaught much people and the disciples were called christians first inantioch and in these days came prophets from jerusalem unto antioch and there stood up one of them named agabus and signified bythe spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the worldwhich came to pass in the days of claudius caesar then the disciples every man according to his abilitydetermined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in judaea which also they did and sent it to the elders by the hands ofbarnabas and saul now about that time herod the king stretched forth his hands tovex certain of the church and he killed james the brother of john with the sword and because he saw it pleased the jews he proceeded further totake peter also then were the days of unleavened bread   andwhen he had apprehended him he put him in prison and delivered himto four quaternions of soldiers to keep him intending after easter tobring him forth to the people peter therefore was kept in prison but prayer was made withoutceasing of the church unto god for him and when herod would have brought him forth the same night peterwas sleeping between two soldiers bound with two chains and thekeepers before the door kept the prison and behold the angel of the lord came upon him and a lightshined in the prison and he smote peter on the side and raised himup saying arise up quickly and his chains fell off from his hands and the angel said unto him gird thyself and bind on thysandalsand so he did and he saith unto him cast thy garment about thee andfollow me and he went out and followed him and wist not that it was truewhich was done by the angel but thought he saw a vision when they were past the first and the second ward they cameunto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city which opened to them ofhis own accord and they went out and passed on through one streetand forthwith the angel departed from him and when peter was come to himself he said now i know of asurety that the lord hath sent his angel and hath delivered me outof the hand of herod and from all the expectation of the people ofthe jews and when he had considered the thing he came to the house ofmary the mother of john whose surname was mark where many weregathered together praying and as peter knocked at the door of the gate a damsel came tohearken named rhoda and when she knew peters voice she opened not the gate forgladness but ran in and told how peter stood before the gate and they said unto her thou art mad but she constantlyaffirmed that it was even so then said they it is his angel but peter continued knocking and when they had opened the doorand saw him they were astonished but he beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peacedeclared unto them how the lord had brought him out of the prison andhe said go shew these things unto james and to the brethren and hedeparted and went into another place now as soon as it was day there was no small stir among thesoldiers what was become of peter and when herod had sought for him and found him not heexamined the keepers and commanded that they should be put to deathand he went down from judaea to caesarea and there abode and herod was highly displeased with them of tyre and sidon butthey came with one accord to him and having made blastus the kingschamberlain their friend desired peace because their country wasnourished by the kings country and upon a set day herod arrayed in royal apparel sat upon histhrone and made an oration unto them and the people gave a shout saying it is the voice of a godand not of a man and immediately the angel of the lord smote him because he gavenot god the glory and he was eaten of worms and gave up the ghost but the word of god grew and multiplied and barnabas and saul returned from jerusalem when they hadfulfilled their ministry and took with them john whose surname wasmark now there were in the church that was at antioch certain prophetsand teachers as barnabas and simeon that was called niger andlucius of cyrene and manaen which had been brought up with herod thetetrarch and saul as they ministered to the lord and fasted the holy ghost saidseparate me barnabas and saul for the work whereunto i have calledthem and when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands onthem they sent them away so they being sent forth by the holy ghost departed untoseleucia and from thence they sailed to cyprus and when they were at salamis they preached the word of god inthe synagogues of the jews and they had also john to their minister and when they had gone through the isle unto paphos they found acertain sorcerer a false prophet a jew whose name was barjesus which was with the deputy of the country sergius paulus aprudent man who called for barnabas and saul and desired to hear theword of god but elymas the sorcerer for so is his name by interpretationwithstood them seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith then saul who also is called paul filled with the holy ghostset his eyes on him and said o full of all subtilty and all mischief thou child ofthe devil thou enemy of all righteousness wilt thou not cease topervert the right ways of the lord   and now behold the handof the lord is upon thee and thou shalt be blind not seeing the sunfor a season and immediately there fell on him a mist and a darknessand he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand then the deputy when he saw what was done believed beingastonished at the doctrine of the lord now when paul and his company loosed from paphos they came toperga in pamphylia and john departing from them returned tojerusalem but when they departed from perga they came to antioch inpisidia and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day and sat down and after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers ofthe synagogue sent unto them saying ye men and brethren if ye haveany word of exhortation for the people say on then paul stood up and beckoning with his hand said men ofisrael and ye that fear god give audience the god of this people of israel chose our fathers and exaltedthe people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of egypt and withan high arm brought he them out of it and about the time of forty years suffered he their manners inthe wilderness and when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of chanaanhe divided their land to them by lot and after that he gave unto them judges about the space of fourhundred and fifty years until samuel the prophet and afterward they desired a king and god gave unto them saulthe son of cis a man of the tribe of benjamin by the space of fortyyears and when he had removed him he raised up unto them david to betheir king to whom also he gave their testimony and said i havefound david the son of jesse a man after mine own heart which shallfulfil all my will of this mans seed hath god according to his promise raised untoisrael a saviour jesus  when john had first preached before hiscoming the baptism of repentance to all the people of israel and as john fulfilled his course he said whom think ye that iam  i am not he but behold there cometh one after me whose shoesof his feet i am not worthy to loose men and brethren children of the stock of abraham andwhosoever among you feareth god to you is the word of this salvationsent for they that dwell at jerusalem and their rulers because theyknew him not nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read everysabbath day they have fulfilled them in condemning him and though they found no cause of death in him yet desired theypilate that he should be slain and when they had fulfilled all that was written of him theytook him down from the tree and laid him in a sepulchre but god raised him from the dead  and he was seen manydays of them which came up with him from galilee to jerusalem who arehis witnesses unto the people and we declare unto you glad tidings how that the promise whichwas made unto the fathers  god hath fulfilled the same unto ustheir children in that he hath raised up jesus again as it is alsowritten in the second psalm thou art my son this day have i begottenthee and as concerning that he raised him up from the dead now nomore to return to corruption he said on this wise i will give youthe sure mercies of david wherefore he saith also in another psalm thou shalt not sufferthine holy one to see corruption for david after he had served his own generation by the will ofgod fell on sleep and was laid unto his fathers and saw corruption but he whom god raised again saw no corruption be it known unto you therefore men and brethren that throughthis man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins  and byhim all that believe are justified from all things from which yecould not be justified by the law of moses beware therefore lest that come upon you which is spoken of inthe prophets  behold ye despisers and wonder and perish fori work a work in your days a work which ye shall in no wise believethough a man declare it unto you and when the jews were gone out of the synagogue the gentilesbesought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath now when the congregation was broken up many of the jews andreligious proselytes followed paul and barnabas who speaking tothem persuaded them to continue in the grace of god and the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together tohear the word of god but when the jews saw the multitudes they were filled withenvy and spake against those things which were spoken by paulcontradicting and blaspheming then paul and barnabas waxed bold and said it was necessarythat the word of god should first have been spoken to you but seeingye put it from you and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting lifelo we turn to the gentiles for so hath the lord commanded us saying i have set thee to bea light of the gentiles that thou shouldest be for salvation unto theends of the earth and when the gentiles heard this they were glad and glorifiedthe word of the lord and as many as were ordained to eternal lifebelieved and the word of the lord was published throughout all theregion but the jews stirred up the devout and honourable women and thechief men of the city and raised persecution against paul andbarnabas and expelled them out of their coasts but they shook off the dust of their feet against them and cameunto iconium and the disciples were filled with joy and with the holy ghost and it came to pass in iconium that they went both together intothe synagogue of the jews and so spake that a great multitude bothof the jews and also of the greeks believed but the unbelieving jews stirred up the gentiles and made theirminds evil affected against the brethren long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the lord whichgave testimony unto the word of his grace and granted signs andwonders to be done by their hands but the multitude of the city was divided and part held with thejews and part with the apostles and when there was an assault made both of the gentiles and alsoof the jews with their rulers to use them despitefully and to stonethem  they were ware of it and fled unto lystra and derbecities of lycaonia and unto the region that lieth round about and there they preached the gospel and there sat a certain man at lystra impotent in his feetbeing a cripple from his mothers womb who never had walked  thesame heard paul speak who stedfastly beholding him and perceivingthat he had faith to be healed  said with a loud voice standupright on thy feet and he leaped and walked and when the people saw what paul had done they lifted up theirvoices saying in the speech of lycaonia the gods are come down to usin the likeness of men and they called barnabas jupiter and paul mercurius becausehe was the chief speaker then the priest of jupiter which was before their city broughtoxen and garlands unto the gates and would have done sacrifice withthe people which when the apostles barnabas and paul heard of they renttheir clothes and ran in among the people crying out  andsaying sirs why do ye these things we also are men of like passionswith you and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanitiesunto the living god which made heaven and earth and the sea andall things that are therein  who in times past suffered allnations to walk in their own ways nevertheless he left not himself without witness in that he didgood and gave us rain from heaven and fruitful seasons filling ourhearts with food and gladness and with these sayings scarce restrained they the people thatthey had not done sacrifice unto them and there came thither certain jews from antioch and iconiumwho persuaded the people and having stoned paul drew him out of thecity supposing he had been dead howbeit as the disciples stood round about him he rose up andcame into the city and the next day he departed with barnabas toderbe and when they had preached the gospel to that city and hadtaught many they returned again to lystra and to iconium andantioch  confirming the souls of the disciples and exhortingthem to continue in the faith and that we must through muchtribulation enter into the kingdom of god and when they had ordained them elders in every church and hadprayed with fasting they commended them to the lord on whom theybelieved and after they had passed throughout pisidia they came topamphylia and when they had preached the word in perga they went downinto attalia  and thence sailed to antioch from whence they hadbeen recommended to the grace of god for the work which theyfulfilled and when they were come and had gathered the church togetherthey rehearsed all that god had done with them and how he had openedthe door of faith unto the gentiles and there they abode long time with the disciples and certain men which came down from judaea taught the brethrenand said except ye be circumcised after the manner of moses yecannot be saved when therefore paul and barnabas had no small dissension anddisputation with them they determined that paul and barnabas andcertain other of them should go up to jerusalem unto the apostles andelders about this question and being brought on their way by the church they passed throughphenice and samaria declaring the conversion of the gentiles andthey caused great joy unto all the brethren and when they were come to jerusalem they were received of thechurch and of the apostles and elders and they declared all thingsthat god had done with them but there rose up certain of the sect of the pharisees whichbelieved saying that it was needful to circumcise them and tocommand them to keep the law of moses and the apostles and elders came together for to consider of thismatter and when there had been much disputing peter rose up and saidunto them men and brethren ye know how that a good while ago godmade choice among us that the gentiles by my mouth should hear theword of the gospel and believe and god which knoweth the hearts bare them witness giving themthe holy ghost even as he did unto us  and put no differencebetween us and them purifying their hearts by faith now therefore why tempt ye god to put a yoke upon the neck ofthe disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear but we believe that through the grace of the lord jesus christwe shall be saved even as they then all the multitude kept silence and gave audience tobarnabas and paul declaring what miracles and wonders god had wroughtamong the gentiles by them and after they had held their peace james answered saying menand brethren hearken unto me  simeon hath declared how god atthe first did visit the gentiles to take out of them a people for hisname and to this agree the words of the prophets as it is written after this i will return and will build again the tabernacle ofdavid which is fallen down and i will build again the ruins thereofand i will set it up  that the residue of men might seek afterthe lord and all the gentiles upon whom my name is called saith thelord who doeth all these things known unto god are all his works from the beginning of theworld wherefore my sentence is that we trouble not them which fromamong the gentiles are turned to god  but that we write untothem that they abstain from pollutions of idols and fromfornication and from things strangled and from blood for moses of old time hath in every city them that preach himbeing read in the synagogues every sabbath day then pleased it the apostles and elders with the whole churchto send chosen men of their own company to antioch with paul andbarnabas namely judas surnamed barsabas and silas chief men amongthe brethren  and they wrote letters by them after this mannerthe apostles and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethrenwhich are of the gentiles in antioch and syria and cilicia forasmuch as we have heard that certain which went out from ushave troubled you with words subverting your souls saying ye mustbe circumcised and keep the law to whom we gave no such commandment it seemed good unto us being assembled with one accord to sendchosen men unto you with our beloved barnabas and paul  men thathave hazarded their lives for the name of our lord jesus christ we have sent therefore judas and silas who shall also tell youthe same things by mouth for it seemed good to the holy ghost and to us to lay upon youno greater burden than these necessary things  that ye abstainfrom meats offered to idols and from blood and from thingsstrangled and from fornication from which if ye keep yourselves yeshall do well fare ye well so when they were dismissed they came to antioch and when theyhad gathered the multitude together they delivered the epistle which when they had read they rejoiced for the consolation and judas and silas being prophets also themselves exhortedthe brethren with many words and confirmed them and after they had tarried there a space they were let go inpeace from the brethren unto the apostles notwithstanding it pleased silas to abide there still paul also and barnabas continued in antioch teaching andpreaching the word of the lord with many others also and some days after paul said unto barnabas let us go again andvisit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word ofthe lord and see how they do and barnabas determined to take with them john whose surnamewas mark but paul thought not good to take him with them who departedfrom them from pamphylia and went not with them to the work and the contention was so sharp between them that they departedasunder one from the other and so barnabas took mark and sailed untocyprus  and paul chose silas and departed being recommended bythe brethren unto the grace of god and he went through syria and cilicia confirming the churches then came he to derbe and lystra and behold a certain disciplewas there named timotheus the son of a certain woman which was ajewess and believed but his father was a greek  which was wellreported of by the brethren that were at lystra and iconium him would paul have to go forth with him and took andcircumcised him because of the jews which were in those quarters forthey knew all that his father was a greek and as they went through the cities they delivered them thedecrees for to keep that were ordained of the apostles and elderswhich were at jerusalem and so were the churches established in the faith and increasedin number daily now when they had gone throughout phrygia and the region ofgalatia and were forbidden of the holy ghost to preach the word inasia  after they were come to mysia they assayed to go intobithynia but the spirit suffered them not and they passing by mysia came down to troas and a vision appeared to paul in the night there stood a man ofmacedonia and prayed him saying come over into macedonia and helpus and after he had seen the vision immediately we endeavoured togo into macedonia assuredly gathering that the lord had called us forto preach the gospel unto them therefore loosing from troas we came with a straight course tosamothracia and the next day to neapolis  and from thence tophilippi which is the chief city of that part of macedonia and acolony and we were in that city abiding certain days and on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river sidewhere prayer was wont to be made and we sat down and spake unto thewomen which resorted thither and a certain woman named lydia a seller of purple of the cityof thyatira which worshipped god heard us whose heart the lordopened that she attended unto the things which were spoken of paul and when she was baptized and her household she besought ussaying if ye have judged me to be faithful to the lord come into myhouse and abide there and she constrained us and it came to pass as we went to prayer a certain damselpossessed with a spirit of divination met us which brought hermasters much gain by soothsaying  the same followed paul and usand cried saying these men are the servants of the most high godwhich shew unto us the way of salvation and this did she many days but paul being grieved turned andsaid to the spirit i command thee in the name of jesus christ to comeout of herand he came out the same hour and when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gonethey caught paul and silas and drew them into the marketplace untothe rulers  and brought them to the magistrates saying thesemen being jews do exceedingly trouble our city  and teachcustoms which are not lawful for us to receive neither to observebeing romans and the multitude rose up together against them and themagistrates rent off their clothes and commanded to beat them and when they had laid many stripes upon them they cast theminto prison charging the jailor to keep them safely  whohaving received such a charge thrust them into the inner prison andmade their feet fast in the stocks and at midnight paul and silas prayed and sang praises untogod and the prisoners heard them and suddenly there was a great earthquake so that thefoundations of the prison were shaken and immediately all the doorswere opened and every ones bands were loosed and the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep andseeing the prison doors open he drew out his sword and would havekilled himself supposing that the prisoners had been fled but paul cried with a loud voice saying do thyself no harmfor we are all here then he called for a light and sprang in and came tremblingand fell down before paul and silas  and brought them out andsaid sirs what must i do to be saved   and they said believeon the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved and thy house and they spake unto him the word of the lord and to all thatwere in his house and he took them the same hour of the night and washed theirstripes and was baptized he and all his straightway and when he had brought them into his house he set meat beforethem and rejoiced believing in god with all his house and when it was day the magistrates sent the serjeants sayinglet those men go and the keeper of the prison told this saying to paul themagistrates have sent to let you go now therefore depart and go inpeace but paul said unto them they have beaten us openly uncondemnedbeing romans and have cast us into prison and now do they thrust usout privily nay verily but let them come themselves and fetch usout and the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates andthey feared when they heard that they were romans and they came and besought them and brought them out anddesired them to depart out of the city and they went out of the prison and entered into the house oflydia and when they had seen the brethren they comforted them anddeparted now when they had passed through amphipolis and apollonia theycame to thessalonica where was a synagogue of the jews  andpaul as his manner was went in unto them and three sabbath daysreasoned with them out of the scriptures  opening and allegingthat christ must needs have suffered and risen again from the deadand that this jesus whom i preach unto you is christ and some of them believed and consorted with paul and silas andof the devout greeks a great multitude and of the chief women not afew but the jews which believed not moved with envy took unto themcertain lewd fellows of the baser sort and gathered a company andset all the city on an uproar and assaulted the house of jason andsought to bring them out to the people and when they found them not they drew jason and certainbrethren unto the rulers of the city crying these that have turnedthe world upside down are come hither also  whom jason hathreceived and these all do contrary to the decrees of caesar sayingthat there is another king one jesus and they troubled the people and the rulers of the city whenthey heard these things and when they had taken security of jason and of the other theylet them go and the brethren immediately sent away paul and silas by nightunto berea who coming thither went into the synagogue of the jews these were more noble than those in thessalonica in that theyreceived the word with all readiness of mind and searched thescriptures daily whether those things were so therefore many of them believed also of honourable women whichwere greeks and of men not a few but when the jews of thessalonica had knowledge that the word ofgod was preached of paul at berea they came thither also and stirredup the people and then immediately the brethren sent away paul to go as itwere to the sea but silas and timotheus abode there still and they that conducted paul brought him unto athens andreceiving a commandment unto silas and timotheus for to come to himwith all speed they departed now while paul waited for them at athens his spirit was stirredin him when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the jews and withthe devout persons and in the market daily with them that met withhim then certain philosophers of the epicureans and of the stoicksencountered him and some said what will this babbler say othersome he seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods because hepreached unto them jesus and the resurrection and they took him and brought him unto areopagus saying maywe know what this new doctrine whereof thou speakest is   forthou bringest certain strange things to our ears we would knowtherefore what these things mean for all the athenians and strangers which were there spenttheir time in nothing else but either to tell or to hear some newthing   then paul stood in the midst of mars hill and saidye men of athens i perceive that in all things ye are toosuperstitious for as i passed by and beheld your devotions i found an altarwith this inscription to the unknown god whom therefore yeignorantly worship him declare i unto you god that made the world and all things therein seeing that heis lord of heaven and earth dwelleth not in temples made with hands neither is worshipped with mens hands as though he needed anything seeing he giveth to all life and breath and all things and hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all theface of the earth and hath determined the times before appointed andthe bounds of their habitation  that they should seek the lordif haply they might feel after him and find him though he be not farfrom every one of us  for in him we live and move and have ourbeing as certain also of your own poets have said for we are alsohis offspring forasmuch then as we are the offspring of god we ought not tothink that the godhead is like unto gold or silver or stone gravenby art and mans device and the times of this ignorance god winked at but nowcommandeth all men every where to repent  because he hathappointed a day in the which he will judge the world in righteousnessby that man whom he hath ordained whereof he hath given assuranceunto all men in that he hath raised him from the dead and when they heard of the resurrection of the dead somemocked and others said we will hear thee again of this matter so paul departed from among them howbeit certain men clave unto him and believed among thewhich was dionysius the areopagite and a woman named damaris andothers with them after these things paul departed from athens and came tocorinth  and found a certain jew named aquila born in pontuslately come from italy with his wife priscilla because thatclaudius had commanded all jews to depart from rome and came untothem and because he was of the same craft he abode with them andwrought for by their occupation they were tentmakers and he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath and persuaded thejews and the greeks and when silas and timotheus were come from macedonia paul waspressed in the spirit and testified to the jews that jesus waschrist and when they opposed themselves and blasphemed he shook hisraiment and said unto them your blood be upon your own heads i amclean from henceforth i will go unto the gentiles and he departed thence and entered into a certain mans housenamed justus one that worshipped god whose house joined hard to thesynagogue and crispus the chief ruler of the synagogue believed on thelord with all his house and many of the corinthians hearing believedand were baptized then spake the lord to paul in the night by a vision be notafraid but speak and hold not thy peace  for i am with theeand no man shall set on thee to hurt thee for i have much people inthis city and he continued there a year and six months teaching the wordof god among them and when gallio was the deputy of achaia the jews madeinsurrection with one accord against paul and brought him to thejudgment seat  saying this fellow persuadeth men to worship godcontrary to the law and when paul was now about to open his mouth gallio said untothe jews if it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness o ye jewsreason would that i should bear with you  but if it be aquestion of words and names and of your law look ye to it for iwill be no judge of such matters and he drave them from the judgment seat then all the greeks took sosthenes the chief ruler of thesynagogue and beat him before the judgment seat and gallio cared fornone of those things and paul after this tarried there yet a good while and thentook his leave of the brethren and sailed thence into syria and withhim priscilla and aquila having shorn his head in cenchrea for hehad a vow and he came to ephesus and left them there but he himselfentered into the synagogue and reasoned with the jews when they desired him to tarry longer time with them heconsented not  but bade them farewell saying i must by allmeans keep this feast that cometh in jerusalem but i will returnagain unto you if god will and he sailed from ephesus and when he had landed at caesarea and gone up and saluted thechurch he went down to antioch and after he had spent some time there he departed and wentover all the country of galatia and phrygia in order strengtheningall the disciples and a certain jew named apollos born at alexandria an eloquentman and mighty in the scriptures came to ephesus this man was instructed in the way of the lord and beingfervent in the spirit he spake and taught diligently the things ofthe lord knowing only the baptism of john and he began to speak boldly in the synagogue whom when aquilaand priscilla had heard they took him unto them and expounded untohim the way of god more perfectly and when he was disposed to pass into achaia the brethrenwrote exhorting the disciples to receive him who when he was comehelped them much which had believed through grace  for hemightily convinced the jews and that publickly shewing by thescriptures that jesus was christ and it came to pass that while apollos was at corinth paulhaving passed through the upper coasts came to ephesus and findingcertain disciples  he said unto them have ye received the holyghost since ye believed  and they said unto him we have not so muchas heard whether there be any holy ghost and he said unto them unto what then were ye baptized and theysaid unto johns baptism then said paul john verily baptized with the baptism ofrepentance saying unto the people that they should believe on himwhich should come after him that is on christ jesus when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the lordjesus and when paul had laid his hands upon them the holy ghost cameon them and they spake with tongues and prophesied and all the men were about twelve and he went into the synagogue and spake boldly for the space ofthree months disputing and persuading the things concerning thekingdom of god but when divers were hardened and believed not but spake evilof that way before the multitude he departed from them and separatedthe disciples disputing daily in the school of one tyrannus and this continued by the space of two years so that all theywhich dwelt in asia heard the word of the lord jesus both jews andgreeks and god wrought special miracles by the hands of paul  sothat from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or apronsand the diseases departed from them and the evil spirits went out ofthem then certain of the vagabond jews exorcists took upon them tocall over them which had evil spirits the name of the lord jesussaying we adjure you by jesus whom paul preacheth and there were seven sons of one sceva a jew and chief of thepriests which did so and the evil spirit answered and said jesus i know and paul iknow but who are ye   and the man in whom the evil spirit wasleaped on them and overcame them and prevailed against them so thatthey fled out of that house naked and wounded and this was known to all the jews and greeks also dwelling atephesus and fear fell on them all and the name of the lord jesus wasmagnified and many that believed came and confessed and shewed theirdeeds many of them also which used curious arts brought their bookstogether and burned them before all men and they counted the priceof them and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver so mightily grew the word of god and prevailed after these things were ended paul purposed in the spirit whenhe had passed through macedonia and achaia to go to jerusalemsaying after i have been there i must also see rome so he sent into macedonia two of them that ministered unto himtimotheus and erastus but he himself stayed in asia for a season and the same time there arose no small stir about that way for a certain man named demetrius a silversmith which madesilver shrines for diana brought no small gain unto the craftsmen whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation andsaid sirs ye know that by this craft we have our wealth moreover ye see and hear that not alone at ephesus but almostthroughout all asia this paul hath persuaded and turned away muchpeople saying that they be no gods which are made with hands so that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought butalso that the temple of the great goddess diana should be despisedand her magnificence should be destroyed whom all asia and the worldworshippeth and when they heard these sayings they were full of wrath andcried out saying great is diana of the ephesians and the whole city was filled with confusion and having caughtgaius and aristarchus men of macedonia pauls companions in travelthey rushed with one accord into the theatre and when paul would have entered in unto the people thedisciples suffered him not and certain of the chief of asia which were his friends sentunto him desiring him that he would not adventure himself into thetheatre some therefore cried one thing and some another for theassembly was confused and the more part knew not wherefore they werecome together and they drew alexander out of the multitude the jews puttinghim forward and alexander beckoned with the hand and would have madehis defence unto the people but when they knew that he was a jew all with one voice aboutthe space of two hours cried out great is diana of the ephesians and when the townclerk had appeased the people he said ye menof ephesus what man is there that knoweth not how that the city ofthe ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess diana and of theimage which fell down from jupiter   seeing then that thesethings cannot be spoken against ye ought to be quiet and to donothing rashly for ye have brought hither these men which are neither robbersof churches nor yet blasphemers of your goddess wherefore if demetrius and the craftsmen which are with himhave a matter against any man the law is open and there aredeputies let them implead one another but if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters it shallbe determined in a lawful assembly for we are in danger to be called in question for this daysuproar there being no cause whereby we may give an account of thisconcourse and when he had thus spoken he dismissed the assembly and after the uproar was ceased paul called unto him thedisciples and embraced them and departed for to go into macedonia and when he had gone over those parts and had given them muchexhortation he came into greece  and there abode three monthsand when the jews laid wait for him as he was about to sail intosyria he purposed to return through macedonia and there accompanied him into asia sopater of berea and of thethessalonians aristarchus and secundus and gaius of derbe andtimotheus and of asia tychicus and trophimus these going before tarried for us at troas and we sailed away from philippi after the days of unleavenedbread and came unto them to troas in five days where we abode sevendays and upon the first day of the week when the disciples cametogether to break bread paul preached unto them ready to depart onthe morrow and continued his speech until midnight and there were many lights in the upper chamber where they weregathered together and there sat in a window a certain young man named eutychusbeing fallen into a deep sleep and as paul was long preaching hesunk down with sleep and fell down from the third loft and was takenup dead and paul went down and fell on him and embracing him saidtrouble not yourselves for his life is in him when he therefore was come up again and had broken bread andeaten and talked a long while even till break of day so hedeparted and they brought the young man alive and were not a littlecomforted and we went before to ship and sailed unto assos thereintending to take in paul for so had he appointed minding himself togo afoot and when he met with us at assos we took him in and came tomitylene and we sailed thence and came the next day over against chiosand the next day we arrived at samos and tarried at trogyllium andthe next day we came to miletus for paul had determined to sail by ephesus because he would notspend the time in asia for he hasted if it were possible for him tobe at jerusalem the day of pentecost and from miletus he sent to ephesus and called the elders ofthe church and when they were come to him he said unto them ye know fromthe first day that i came into asia after what manner i have beenwith you at all seasons  serving the lord with all humility ofmind and with many tears and temptations which befell me by thelying in wait of the jews  and how i kept back nothing that wasprofitable unto you but have shewed you and have taught youpublickly and from house to house  testifying both to the jewsand also to the greeks repentance toward god and faith toward ourlord jesus christ and now behold i go bound in the spirit unto jerusalem notknowing the things that shall befall me there  save that theholy ghost witnesseth in every city saying that bonds and afflictionsabide me but none of these things move me neither count i my life dearunto myself so that i might finish my course with joy and theministry which i have received of the lord jesus to testify thegospel of the grace of god and now behold i know that ye all among whom i have gonepreaching the kingdom of god shall see my face no more wherefore i take you to record this day that i am pure from theblood of all men for i have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel ofgod take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock overthe which the holy ghost hath made you overseers to feed the churchof god which he hath purchased with his own blood for i know this that after my departing shall grievous wolvesenter in among you not sparing the flock also of your own selves shall men arise speaking perversethings to draw away disciples after them therefore watch and remember that by the space of three yearsi ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears and now brethren i commend you to god and to the word of hisgrace which is able to build you up and to give you an inheritanceamong all them which are sanctified i have coveted no mans silver or gold or apparel yea ye yourselves know that these hands have ministered untomy necessities and to them that were with me i have shewed you all things how that so labouring ye ought tosupport the weak and to remember the words of the lord jesus how hesaid it is more blessed to give than to receive and when he had thus spoken he kneeled down and prayed withthem all and they all wept sore and fell on pauls neck and kissed him sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake that theyshould see his face no more and they accompanied him unto the ship and it came to pass that after we were gotten from them and hadlaunched we came with a straight course unto coos and the dayfollowing unto rhodes and from thence unto patara  and finding aship sailing over unto phenicia we went aboard and set forth now when we had discovered cyprus we left it on the left handand sailed into syria and landed at tyre for there the ship was tounlade her burden and finding disciples we tarried there seven days who said topaul through the spirit that he should not go up to jerusalem and when we had accomplished those days we departed and went ourway and they all brought us on our way with wives and children tillwe were out of the city and we kneeled down on the shore and prayed and when we had taken our leave one of another we took ship andthey returned home again and when we had finished our course from tyre we came toptolemais and saluted the brethren and abode with them one day and the next day we that were of pauls company departed andcame unto caesarea and we entered into the house of philip theevangelist which was one of the seven and abode with him and the same man had four daughters virgins which did prophesy and as we tarried there many days there came down from judaea acertain prophet named agabus and when he was come unto us he took pauls girdle and boundhis own hands and feet and said thus saith the holy ghost so shallthe jews at jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle and shalldeliver him into the hands of the gentiles and when we heard these things both we and they of that placebesought him not to go up to jerusalem then paul answered what mean ye to weep and to break mineheart  for i am ready not to be bound only but also to die atjerusalem for the name of the lord jesus and when he would not be persuaded we ceased saying the willof the lord be done and after those days we took up our carriages and went up tojerusalem there went with us also certain of the disciples of caesareaand brought with them one mnason of cyprus an old disciple with whomwe should lodge and when we were come to jerusalem the brethren received usgladly and the day following paul went in with us unto james and allthe elders were present and when he had saluted them he declared particularly whatthings god had wrought among the gentiles by his ministry and when they heard it they glorified the lord and said untohim thou seest brother how many thousands of jews there are whichbelieve and they are all zealous of the law  and they areinformed of thee that thou teachest all the jews which are among thegentiles to forsake moses saying that they ought not to circumcisetheir children neither to walk after the customs what is it therefore the multitude must needs come togetherfor they will hear that thou art come do therefore this that we say to thee we have four men whichhave a vow on them  them take and purify thyself with them andbe at charges with them that they may shave their heads and all mayknow that those things whereof they were informed concerning theeare nothing but that thou thyself also walkest orderly and keepestthe law as touching the gentiles which believe we have written andconcluded that they observe no such thing save only that they keepthemselves from things offered to idols and from blood and fromstrangled and from fornication then paul took the men and the next day purifying himself withthem entered into the temple to signify the accomplishment of thedays of purification until that an offering should be offered forevery one of them and when the seven days were almost ended the jews which wereof asia when they saw him in the temple stirred up all the peopleand laid hands on him  crying out men of israel help this isthe man that teacheth all men every where against the people and thelaw and this place and further brought greeks also into the templeand hath polluted this holy place for they had seen before with him in the city trophimus anephesian whom they supposed that paul had brought into the temple and all the city was moved and the people ran together andthey took paul and drew him out of the temple and forthwith thedoors were shut and as they went about to kill him tidings came unto the chiefcaptain of the band that all jerusalem was in an uproar who immediately took soldiers and centurions and ran down untothem and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers they leftbeating of paul then the chief captain came near and took him and commandedhim to be bound with two chains and demanded who he was and what hehad done and some cried one thing some another among the multitude andwhen he could not know the certainty for the tumult he commanded himto be carried into the castle and when he came upon the stairs so it was that he was borneof the soldiers for the violence of the people for the multitude of the people followed after crying awaywith him and as paul was to be led into the castle he said unto thechief captain may i speak unto thee who said canst thou speakgreek   art not thou that egyptian which before these daysmadest an uproar and leddest out into the wilderness four thousandmen that were murderers   but paul said i am a man which am ajew of tarsus a city in cilicia a citizen of no mean city and ibeseech thee suffer me to speak unto the people and when he had given him licence paul stood on the stairs andbeckoned with the hand unto the people and when there was made agreat silence he spake unto them in the hebrew tongue saying men brethren and fathers hear ye my defence which i make now untoyou and when they heard that he spake in the hebrew tongue to themthey kept the more silence and he saith  i am verily a manwhich am a jew born in tarsus a city in cilicia yet brought up inthis city at the feet of gamaliel and taught according to the perfectmanner of the law of the fathers and was zealous toward god as yeall are this day and i persecuted this way unto the death binding and deliveringinto prisons both men and women as also the high priest doth bear me witness and all the estateof the elders from whom also i received letters unto the brethrenand went to damascus to bring them which were there bound untojerusalem for to be punished and it came to pass that as i made my journey and was comenigh unto damascus about noon suddenly there shone from heaven agreat light round about me and i fell unto the ground and heard a voice saying unto mesaul saul why persecutest thou me   and i answered who artthou lord and he said unto me i am jesus of nazareth whom thoupersecutest and they that were with me saw indeed the light and were afraidbut they heard not the voice of him that spake to me and i said what shall i do lord and the lord said unto mearise and go into damascus and there it shall be told thee of allthings which are appointed for thee to do and when i could not see for the glory of that light being ledby the hand of them that were with me i came into damascus and one ananias a devout man according to the law having agood report of all the jews which dwelt there  came unto me andstood and said unto me brother saul receive thy sight and the samehour i looked up upon him and he said the god of our fathers hath chosen thee that thoushouldest know his will and see that just one and shouldest hear thevoice of his mouth for thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hastseen and heard and now why tarriest thou arise and be baptized and wash awaythy sins calling on the name of the lord and it came to pass that when i was come again to jerusalemeven while i prayed in the temple i was in a trance  and sawhim saying unto me make haste and get thee quickly out of jerusalemfor they will not receive thy testimony concerning me and i said lord they know that i imprisoned and beat in everysynagogue them that believed on thee  and when the blood of thymartyr stephen was shed i also was standing by and consenting untohis death and kept the raiment of them that slew him and he said unto me depart for i will send thee far hence untothe gentiles and they gave him audience unto this word and then lifted uptheir voices and said away with such a fellow from the earth for itis not fit that he should live and as they cried out and cast off their clothes and threwdust into the air  the chief captain commanded him to be broughtinto the castle and bade that he should be examined by scourgingthat he might know wherefore they cried so against him and as they bound him with thongs paul said unto the centurionthat stood by is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a romanand uncondemned   when the centurion heard that he went andtold the chief captain saying take heed what thou doest for thisman is a roman then the chief captain came and said unto him tell me artthou a roman he said yea and the chief captain answered with a great sum obtained i thisfreedom and paul said but i was free born then straightway they departed from him which should haveexamined him and the chief captain also was afraid after he knewthat he was a roman and because he had bound him on the morrow because he would have known the certaintywherefore he was accused of the jews he loosed him from his bandsand commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear andbrought paul down and set him before them and paul earnestly beholding the council said men andbrethren i have lived in all good conscience before god until thisday and the high priest ananias commanded them that stood by him tosmite him on the mouth then said paul unto him god shall smite thee thou whited wallfor sittest thou to judge me after the law and commandest me to besmitten contrary to the law   and they that stood by saidrevilest thou gods high priest   then said paul i wist notbrethren that he was the high priest for it is written thou shaltnot speak evil of the ruler of thy people but when paul perceived that the one part were sadducees and theother pharisees he cried out in the council men and brethren i am apharisee the son of a pharisee of the hope and resurrection of thedead i am called in question and when he had so said there arose a dissension between thepharisees and the sadducees and the multitude was divided for the sadducees say that there is no resurrection neitherangel nor spirit but the pharisees confess both and there arose a great cry and the scribes that were of thepharisees part arose and strove saying we find no evil in thisman but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him let us not fightagainst god and when there arose a great dissension the chief captainfearing lest paul should have been pulled in pieces of them commandedthe soldiers to go down and to take him by force from among them andto bring him into the castle and the night following the lord stood by him and said be ofgood cheer paul for as thou hast testified of me in jerusalem somust thou bear witness also at rome and when it was day certain of the jews banded together andbound themselves under a curse saying that they would neither eat nordrink till they had killed paul and they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy and they came to the chief priests and elders and said we havebound ourselves under a great curse that we will eat nothing until wehave slain paul now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captainthat he bring him down unto you to morrow as though ye would enquiresomething more perfectly concerning him and we or ever he come nearare ready to kill him and when pauls sisters son heard of their lying in wait hewent and entered into the castle and told paul then paul called one of the centurions unto him and said bringthis young man unto the chief captain for he hath a certain thing totell him so he took him and brought him to the chief captain and saidpaul the prisoner called me unto him and prayed me to bring thisyoung man unto thee who hath something to say unto thee then the chief captain took him by the hand and went with himaside privately and asked him what is that thou hast to tell me and he said the jews have agreed to desire thee that thouwouldest bring down paul to morrow into the council as though theywould enquire somewhat of him more perfectly but do not thou yield unto them for there lie in wait for himof them more than forty men which have bound themselves with an oaththat they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him andnow are they ready looking for a promise from thee so the chief captain then let the young man depart and chargedhim see thou tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me and he called unto him two centurions saying make ready twohundred soldiers to go to caesarea and horsemen threescore and tenand spearmen two hundred at the third hour of the night  andprovide them beasts that they may set paul on and bring him safeunto felix the governor and he wrote a letter after this manner  claudius lysiasunto the most excellent governor felix sendeth greeting this man was taken of the jews and should have been killed ofthem then came i with an army and rescued him having understoodthat he was a roman and when i would have known the cause wherefore they accusedhim i brought him forth into their council  whom i perceived tobe accused of questions of their law but to have nothing laid to hischarge worthy of death or of bonds and when it was told me how that the jews laid wait for the mani sent straightway to thee and gave commandment to his accusers alsoto say before thee what they had against him farewell then the soldiers as it was commanded them took paul andbrought him by night to antipatris on the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him andreturned to the castle  who when they came to caesarea anddelivered the epistle to the governor presented paul also before him and when the governor had read the letter he asked of whatprovince he was and when he understood that he was of cilicia i will hear thee said he when thine accusers are also come and hecommanded him to be kept in herods judgment hall and after five days ananias the high priest descended with theelders and with a certain orator named tertullus who informed thegovernor against paul and when he was called forth tertullus began to accuse himsaying seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness and that veryworthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence  weaccept it always and in all places most noble felix with allthankfulness notwithstanding that i be not further tedious unto thee i praythee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words for we have found this man a pestilent fellow and a mover ofsedition among all the jews throughout the world and a ringleader ofthe sect of the nazarenes  who also hath gone about to profanethe temple whom we took and would have judged according to our law but the chief captain lysias came upon us and with greatviolence took him away out of our hands  commanding his accusersto come unto thee by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledgeof all these things whereof we accuse him and the jews also assented saying that these things were so then paul after that the governor had beckoned unto him tospeak answered forasmuch as i know that thou hast been of many yearsa judge unto this nation i do the more cheerfully answer for myself because that thou mayest understand that there are yet buttwelve days since i went up to jerusalem for to worship and they neither found me in the temple disputing with any manneither raising up the people neither in the synagogues nor in thecity  neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuseme but this i confess unto thee that after the way which they callheresy so worship i the god of my fathers believing all things whichare written in the law and in the prophets  and have hope towardgod which they themselves also allow that there shall be aresurrection of the dead both of the just and unjust and herein do i exercise myself to have always a consciencevoid to offence toward god and toward men now after many years i came to bring alms to my nation andofferings whereupon certain jews from asia found me purified in thetemple neither with multitude nor with tumult who ought to have been here before thee and object if they hadought against me or else let these same here say if they have found any evildoing in me while i stood before the council  except it be forthis one voice that i cried standing among them touching theresurrection of the dead i am called in question by you this day and when felix heard these things having more perfect knowledgeof that way he deferred them and said when lysias the chief captainshall come down i will know the uttermost of your matter and he commanded a centurion to keep paul and to let him haveliberty and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance tominister or come unto him and after certain days when felix came with his wife drusillawhich was a jewess he sent for paul and heard him concerning thefaith in christ and as he reasoned of righteousness temperance and judgment tocome felix trembled and answered go thy way for this time when ihave a convenient season i will call for thee he hoped also that money should have been given him of paulthat he might loose him wherefore he sent for him the oftener andcommuned with him but after two years porcius festus came into felix room andfelix willing to shew the jews a pleasure left paul bound now when festus was come into the province after three days heascended from caesarea to jerusalem then the high priest and the chief of the jews informed himagainst paul and besought him  and desired favour against himthat he would send for him to jerusalem laying wait in the way tokill him but festus answered that paul should be kept at caesarea andthat he himself would depart shortly thither let them therefore said he which among you are able go downwith me and accuse this man if there be any wickedness in him and when he had tarried among them more than ten days he wentdown unto caesarea and the next day sitting on the judgment seatcommanded paul to be brought and when he was come the jews which came down from jerusalemstood round about and laid many and grievous complaints against paulwhich they could not prove while he answered for himself neither against the law of thejews neither against the temple nor yet against caesar have ioffended any thing at all but festus willing to do the jews a pleasure answered paul andsaid wilt thou go up to jerusalem and there be judged of thesethings before me   then said paul i stand at caesars judgmentseat where i ought to be judged to the jews have i done no wrong asthou very well knowest for if i be an offender or have committed any thing worthy ofdeath i refuse not to die but if there be none of these thingswhereof these accuse me no man may deliver me unto them i appealunto caesar then festus when he had conferred with the council answeredhast thou appealed unto caesar unto caesar shalt thou go and after certain days king agrippa and bernice came untocaesarea to salute festus and when they had been there many days festus declared paulscause unto the king saying there is a certain man left in bonds byfelix  about whom when i was at jerusalem the chief priestsand the elders of the jews informed me desiring to have judgmentagainst him to whom i answered it is not the manner of the romans todeliver any man to die before that he which is accused have theaccusers face to face and have licence to answer for himselfconcerning the crime laid against him therefore when they were come hither without any delay on themorrow i sat on the judgment seat and commanded the man to be broughtforth against whom when the accusers stood up they brought noneaccusation of such things as i supposed  but had certainquestions against him of their own superstition and of one jesuswhich was dead whom paul affirmed to be alive and because i doubted of such manner of questions i asked himwhether he would go to jerusalem and there be judged of thesematters but when paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing ofaugustus i commanded him to be kept till i might send him to caesar then agrippa said unto festus i would also hear the man myselfto morrow said he thou shalt hear him and on the morrow when agrippa was come and bernice withgreat pomp and was entered into the place of hearing with the chiefcaptains and principal men of the city at festus commandment paulwas brought forth and festus said king agrippa and all men which are herepresent with us ye see this man about whom all the multitude of thejews have dealt with me both at jerusalem and also here crying thathe ought not to live any longer but when i found that he had committed nothing worthy of deathand that he himself hath appealed to augustus i have determined tosend him of whom i have no certain thing to write unto my lord whereforei have brought him forth before you and specially before thee o kingagrippa that after examination had i might have somewhat to write for it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner and notwithal to signify the crimes laid against him then agrippa said unto paul thou art permitted to speak forthyselfthen paul stretched forth the hand and answered for himself  ithink myself happy king agrippa because i shall answer for myselfthis day before thee touching all the things whereof i am accused ofthe jews  especially because i know thee to be expert in allcustoms and questions which are among the jews wherefore i beseechthee to hear me patiently my manner of life from my youth which was at the first amongmine own nation at jerusalem know all the jews  which knew mefrom the beginning if they would testify that after the moststraitest sect of our religion i lived a pharisee and now i stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made ofgod unto our fathers  unto which promise our twelve tribesinstantly serving god day and night hope to come for which hopessake king agrippa i am accused of the jews why should it be thought a thing incredible with you that godshould raise the dead   i verily thought with myself that iought to do many things contrary to the name of jesus of nazareth which thing i also did in jerusalem and many of the saints didi shut up in prison having received authority from the chief priestsand when they were put to death i gave my voice against them and i punished them oft in every synagogue and compelled themto blaspheme and being exceedingly mad against them i persecutedthem even unto strange cities whereupon as i went to damascus with authority and commissionfrom the chief priests  at midday o king i saw in the way alight from heaven above the brightness of the sun shining roundabout me and them which journeyed with me and when we were all fallen to the earth i heard a voicespeaking unto me and saying in the hebrew tongue saul saul whypersecutest thou me it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks and i said who art thou lord and he said i am jesus whomthou persecutest but rise and stand upon thy feet for i have appeared unto theefor this purpose to make thee a minister and a witness both of thesethings which thou hast seen and of those things in the which i willappear unto thee  delivering thee from the people and from thegentiles unto whom now i send thee  to open their eyes and toturn them from darkness to light and from the power of satan untogod that they may receive forgiveness of sins and inheritance amongthem which are sanctified by faith that is in me whereupon o king agrippa i was not disobedient unto theheavenly vision  but shewed first unto them of damascus and atjerusalem and throughout all the coasts of judaea and then to thegentiles that they should repent and turn to god and do works meetfor repentance for these causes the jews caught me in the temple and wentabout to kill me having therefore obtained help of god i continue unto this daywitnessing both to small and great saying none other things thanthose which the prophets and moses did say should come  thatchrist should suffer and that he should be the first that should risefrom the dead and should shew light unto the people and to thegentiles and as he thus spake for himself festus said with a loud voicepaul thou art beside thyself much learning doth make thee mad but he said i am not mad most noble festus but speak forththe words of truth and soberness for the king knoweth of these things before whom also i speakfreely for i am persuaded that none of these things are hidden fromhim for this thing was not done in a corner king agrippa believest thou the prophets i know that thoubelievest then agrippa said unto paul almost thou persuadest me to be achristian and paul said i would to god that not only thou but also allthat hear me this day were both almost and altogether such as i amexcept these bonds and when he had thus spoken the king rose up and the governorand bernice and they that sat with them  and when they weregone aside they talked between themselves saying this man doethnothing worthy of death or of bonds then said agrippa unto festus this man might have been set atliberty if he had not appealed unto caesar and when it was determined that we should sail into italy theydelivered paul and certain other prisoners unto one named julius acenturion of augustus band and entering into a ship of adramyttium we launched meaning tosail by the coasts of asia one aristarchus a macedonian ofthessalonica being with us and the next day we touched at sidon and julius courteouslyentreated paul and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refreshhimself and when we had launched from thence we sailed under cyprusbecause the winds were contrary and when we had sailed over the sea of cilicia and pamphylia wecame to myra a city of lycia and there the centurion found a ship of alexandria sailing intoitaly and he put us therein and when we had sailed slowly many days and scarce were comeover against cnidus the wind not suffering us we sailed under creteover against salmone  and hardly passing it came unto a placewhich is called the fair havens nigh whereunto was the city of lasea now when much time was spent and when sailing was now dangerousbecause the fast was now already past paul admonished them  andsaid unto them sirs i perceive that this voyage will be with hurtand much damage not only of the lading and ship but also of ourlives nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner ofthe ship more than those things which were spoken by paul and because the haven was not commodious to winter in the morepart advised to depart thence also if by any means they might attainto phenice and there to winter which is an haven of crete and liethtoward the south west and north west and when the south wind blew softly supposing that they hadobtained their purpose loosing thence they sailed close by crete but not long after there arose against it a tempestuous windcalled euroclydon and when the ship was caught and could not bear up into thewind we let her drive and running under a certain island which is called clauda wehad much work to come by the boat  which when they had taken upthey used helps undergirding the ship and fearing lest they shouldfall into the quicksands strake sail and so were driven and we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest the next daythey lightened the ship  and the third day we cast out with ourown hands the tackling of the ship and when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared and nosmall tempest lay on us all hope that we should be saved was thentaken away but after long abstinence paul stood forth in the midst of themand said sirs ye should have hearkened unto me and not have loosedfrom crete and to have gained this harm and loss and now i exhort you to be of good cheer for there shall be noloss of any mans life among you but of the ship for there stood by me this night the angel of god whose i amand whom i serve  saying fear not paul thou must be broughtbefore caesar and lo god hath given thee all them that sail withthee wherefore sirs be of good cheer for i believe god that itshall be even as it was told me howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island but when the fourteenth night was come as we were driven up anddown in adria about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew nearto some country  and sounded and found it twenty fathoms andwhen they had gone a little further they sounded again and found itfifteen fathoms then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks they castfour anchors out of the stern and wished for the day and as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship when theyhad let down the boat into the sea under colour as though they wouldhave cast anchors out of the foreship  paul said to thecenturion and to the soldiers except these abide in the ship yecannot be saved then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat and let herfall off and while the day was coming on paul besought them all to takemeat saying this day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried andcontinued fasting having taken nothing wherefore i pray you to take some meat for this is for yourhealth for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you and when he had thus spoken he took bread and gave thanks togod in presence of them all and when he had broken it he began toeat then were they all of good cheer and they also took some meat and we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore andsixteen souls and when they had eaten enough they lightened the ship andcast out the wheat into the sea and when it was day they knew not the land but they discovereda certain creek with a shore into the which they were minded if itwere possible to thrust in the ship and when they had taken up the anchors they committedthemselves unto the sea and loosed the rudder bands and hoised upthe mainsail to the wind and made toward shore and falling into a place where two seas met they ran the shipaground and the forepart stuck fast and remained unmoveable but thehinder part was broken with the violence of the waves and the soldiers counsel was to kill the prisoners lest any ofthem should swim out and escape but the centurion willing to save paul kept them from theirpurpose and commanded that they which could swim should castthemselves first into the sea and get to land  and the restsome on boards and some on broken pieces of the shipand so it came to pass that they escaped all safe to land and when they were escaped then they knew that the island wascalled melita and the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness for theykindled a fire and received us every one because of the presentrain and because of the cold and when paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them onthe fire there came a viper out of the heat and fastened on hishand and when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his handthey said among themselves no doubt this man is a murderer whomthough he hath escaped the sea yet vengeance suffereth not to live and he shook off the beast into the fire and felt no harm howbeit they looked when he should have swollen or fallen downdead suddenly but after they had looked a great while and saw noharm come to him they changed their minds and said that he was agod in the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of theisland whose name was publius who received us and lodged us threedays courteously and it came to pass that the father of publius lay sick of afever and of a bloody flux to whom paul entered in and prayed andlaid his hands on him and healed him so when this was done others also which had diseases in theisland came and were healed  who also honoured us with manyhonours and when we departed they laded us with such things as werenecessary and after three months we departed in a ship of alexandriawhich had wintered in the isle whose sign was castor and pollux and landing at syracuse we tarried there three days and from thence we fetched a compass and came to rhegium andafter one day the south wind blew and we came the next day toputeoli  where we found brethren and were desired to tarry withthem seven days and so we went toward rome and from thence when the brethren heard of us they came tomeet us as far as appii forum and the three taverns whom when paulsaw he thanked god and took courage and when we came to rome the centurion delivered the prisonersto the captain of the guard but paul was suffered to dwell by himselfwith a soldier that kept him and it came to pass that after three days paul called the chiefof the jews together and when they were come together he said untothem men and brethren though i have committed nothing against thepeople or customs of our fathers yet was i delivered prisoner fromjerusalem into the hands of the romans who when they had examined me would have let me go becausethere was no cause of death in me but when the jews spake against it i was constrained to appealunto caesar not that i had ought to accuse my nation of for this cause therefore have i called for you to see you andto speak with you because that for the hope of israel i am bound withthis chain and they said unto him we neither received letters out ofjudaea concerning thee neither any of the brethren that came shewedor spake any harm of thee but we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest for asconcerning this sect we know that every where it is spoken against and when they had appointed him a day there came many to himinto his lodging to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom ofgod persuading them concerning jesus both out of the law of mosesand out of the prophets from morning till evening and some believed the things which were spoken and somebelieved not and when they agreed not among themselves they departed afterthat paul had spoken one word well spake the holy ghost by esaias theprophet unto our fathers  saying go unto this people and sayhearing ye shall hear and shall not understand and seeing ye shallsee and not perceive  for the heart of this people is waxedgross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes have theyclosed lest they should see with their eyes and hear with theirears and understand with their heart and should be converted and ishould heal them be it known therefore unto you that the salvation of god issent unto the gentiles and that they will hear it and when he had said these words the jews departed and hadgreat reasoning among themselves and paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house andreceived all that came in unto him  preaching the kingdom ofgod and teaching those things which concern the lord jesus christwith all confidence no man forbidding himthe epistle of paul the apostle to the romans paul a servant of jesus christ called to be an apostleseparated unto the gospel of god  which he had promised afore byhis prophets in the holy scriptures  concerning his son jesuschrist our lord which was made of the seed of david according to theflesh  and declared to be the son of god with power according tothe spirit of holiness by the resurrection from the dead  by whomwe have received grace and apostleship for obedience to the faithamong all nations for his name  among whom are ye also the calledof jesus christ  to all that be in rome beloved of god called tobe saints grace to you and peace from god our father and the lordjesus christ first i thank my god through jesus christ for you all that yourfaith is spoken of throughout the whole world for god is my witness whom i serve with my spirit in the gospelof his son that without ceasing i make mention of you always in myprayers  making request if by any means now at length i mighthave a prosperous journey by the will of god to come unto you for i long to see you that i may impart unto you some spiritualgift to the end ye may be established  that is that i may becomforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me now i would not have you ignorant brethren that oftentimes ipurposed to come unto you but was let hitherto that i might havesome fruit among you also even as among other gentiles i am debtor both to the greeks and to the barbarians both tothe wise and to the unwise so as much as in me is i am ready to preach the gospel to youthat are at rome also for i am not ashamed of the gospel of christ for it is the powerof god unto salvation to every one that believeth to the jew firstand also to the greek for therein is the righteousness of god revealed from faith tofaith as it is written the just shall live by faith for the wrath of god is revealed from heaven against allungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth inunrighteousness  because that which may be known of god ismanifest in them for god hath shewed it unto them for the invisible things of him from the creation of the worldare clearly seen being understood by the things that are made evenhis eternal power and godhead so that they are without excuse because that when they knew god they glorified him not as godneither were thankful but became vain in their imaginations andtheir foolish heart was darkened professing themselves to be wise they became fools  andchanged the glory of the uncorruptible god into an image made like tocorruptible man and to birds and fourfooted beasts and creepingthings wherefore god also gave them up to uncleanness through the lustsof their own hearts to dishonour their own bodies between themselves who changed the truth of god into a lie and worshipped andserved the creature more than the creator who is blessed for everamen for this cause god gave them up unto vile affections for eventheir women did change the natural use into that which is againstnature  and likewise also the men leaving the natural use of thewoman burned in their lust one toward another men with men workingthat which is unseemly and receiving in themselves that recompence oftheir error which was meet and even as they did not like to retain god in their knowledgegod gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which arenot convenient  being filled with all unrighteousnessfornication wickedness covetousness maliciousness full of envymurder debate deceit malignity whisperers  backbiters hatersof god despiteful proud boasters inventors of evil thingsdisobedient to parents  without understanding covenantbreakerswithout natural affection implacable unmerciful  who knowingthe judgment of god that they which commit such things are worthy ofdeath not only do the same but have pleasure in them that do them therefore thou art inexcusable o man whosoever thou art thatjudgest for wherein thou judgest another thou condemnest thyselffor thou that judgest doest the same things but we are sure that the judgment of god is according to truthagainst them which commit such things and thinkest thou this o man that judgest them which do suchthings and doest the same that thou shalt escape the judgment ofgod   or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearanceand longsuffering not knowing that the goodness of god leadeth theeto repentance   but after thy hardness and impenitent hearttreasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath andrevelation of the righteous judgment of god  who will render toevery man according to his deeds  to them who by patientcontinuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortalityeternal life  but unto them that are contentious and do not obeythe truth but obey unrighteousness indignation and wrath tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that doeth evil ofthe jew first and also of the gentile  but glory honour andpeace to every man that worketh good to the jew first and also tothe gentile  for there is no respect of persons with god for as many as have sinned without law shall also perish withoutlaw and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law for not the hearers of the law are just before god but thedoers of the law shall be justified for when the gentiles which have not the law do by nature thethings contained in the law these having not the law are a law untothemselves  which shew the work of the law written in theirhearts their conscience also bearing witness and their thoughts themean while accusing or else excusing one another  in the daywhen god shall judge the secrets of men by jesus christ according tomy gospel behold thou art called a jew and restest in the law and makestthy boast of god  and knowest his will and approvest the thingsthat are more excellent being instructed out of the law  and artconfident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind a light of themwhich are in darkness  an instructor of the foolish a teacher ofbabes which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law thou therefore which teachest another teachest thou not thyselfthou that preachest a man should not steal dost thou steal  thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery dost thou commitadultery thou that abhorrest idols dost thou commit sacrilege  thou that makest thy boast of the law through breaking the lawdishonourest thou god   for the name of god is blasphemed amongthe gentiles through you as it is written for circumcision verily profiteth if thou keep the law but ifthou be a breaker of the law thy circumcision is made uncircumcision therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of thelaw shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision  and shall not uncircumcision which is by nature if it fulfil the lawjudge thee who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress thelaw   for he is not a jew which is one outwardly neither isthat circumcision which is outward in the flesh  but he is ajew which is one inwardly and circumcision is that of the heart inthe spirit and not in the letter whose praise is not of men but ofgod what advantage then hath the jew or what profit is there ofcircumcision   much every way chiefly because that unto themwere committed the oracles of god for what if some did not believe shall their unbelief make thefaith of god without effect   god forbid yea let god be truebut every man a liar as it is written that thou mightest bejustified in thy sayings and mightest overcome when thou art judged but if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of god whatshall we say is god unrighteous who taketh vengeance i speak as aman  god forbid for then how shall god judge the world   forif the truth of god hath more abounded through my lie unto his glorywhy yet am i also judged as a sinner   and not rather as we beslanderously reported and as some affirm that we say let us doevil that good may come whose damnation is just what then are we better than they no in no wise for we havebefore proved both jews and gentiles that they are all under sin as it is written there is none righteous no not one there is none that understandeth there is none that seeketh aftergod they are all gone out of the way they are together becomeunprofitable there is none that doeth good no not one their throat is an open sepulchre with their tongues they haveused deceit the poison of asps is under their lips  whose mouthis full of cursing and bitterness  their feet are swift to shedblood  destruction and misery are in their ways  and the wayof peace have they not known  there is no fear of god beforetheir eyes now we know that what things soever the law saith it saith tothem who are under the law that every mouth may be stopped and allthe world may become guilty before god therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh bejustified in his sight for by the law is the knowledge of sin but now the righteousness of god without the law is manifestedbeing witnessed by the law and the prophets  even therighteousness of god which is by faith of jesus christ unto all andupon all them that believe for there is no difference  for allhave sinned and come short of the glory of god  being justifiedfreely by his grace through the redemption that is in christ jesus whom god hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in hisblood to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that arepast through the forbearance of god  to declare i say at thistime his righteousness that he might be just and the justifier ofhim which believeth in jesus where is boasting then it is excluded by what law of worksnay but by the law of faith therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith withoutthe deeds of the law is he the god of the jews only is he not also of the gentilesyes of the gentiles also  seeing it is one god which shalljustify the circumcision by faith and uncircumcision through faith do we then make void the law through faith god forbid yea weestablish the law what shall we say then that abraham our father as pertaining tothe flesh hath found   for if abraham were justified by works hehath whereof to glory but not before god for what saith the scripture abraham believed god and it wascounted unto him for righteousness now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace butof debt but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justifieththe ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness even as david also describeth the blessedness of the man untowhom god imputeth righteousness without works  saying blessed arethey whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered blessed is the man to whom the lord will not impute sin cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only or uponthe uncircumcision also for we say that faith was reckoned to abrahamfor righteousness how was it then reckoned when he was in circumcision or inuncircumcision not in circumcision but in uncircumcision and he received the sign of circumcision a seal of therighteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised thathe might be the father of all them that believe though they be notcircumcised that righteousness might be imputed unto them also and the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcisiononly but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our fatherabraham which he had being yet uncircumcised for the promise that he should be the heir of the world was notto abraham or to his seed through the law but through therighteousness of faith for if they which are of the law be heirs faith is made voidand the promise made of none effect  because the law workethwrath for where no law is there is no transgression therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace to the endthe promise might be sure to all the seed not to that only which isof the law but to that also which is of the faith of abraham who isthe father of us all  as it is written i have made thee afather of many nations before him whom he believed even god whoquickeneth the dead and calleth those things which be not as thoughthey were who against hope believed in hope that he might become thefather of many nations according to that which was spoken so shallthy seed be and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body nowdead when he was about an hundred years old neither yet the deadnessof sarahs womb  he staggered not at the promise of god throughunbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to god  and beingfully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also toperform and therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness now it was not written for his sake alone that it was imputed tohim  but for us also to whom it shall be imputed if we believeon him that raised up jesus our lord from the dead  who wasdelivered for our offences and was raised again for ourjustification therefore being justified by faith we have peace with god throughour lord jesus christ  by whom also we have access by faith intothis grace wherein we stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of god and not only so but we glory in tribulations also knowing thattribulation worketh patience  and patience experience andexperience hope  and hope maketh not ashamed because the love ofgod is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost which is given untous for when we were yet without strength in due time christ died forthe ungodly for scarcely for a righteous man will one die yet peradventurefor a good man some would even dare to die but god commendeth his love toward us in that while we were yetsinners christ died for us much more then being now justified by his blood we shall besaved from wrath through him for if when we were enemies we were reconciled to god by thedeath of his son much more being reconciled we shall be saved byhis life and not only so but we also joy in god through our lord jesuschrist by whom we have now received the atonement wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world and death bysin and so death passed upon all men for that all have sinned for until the law sin was in the world but sin is not imputed whenthere is no law nevertheless death reigned from adam to moses even over themthat had not sinned after the similitude of adams transgression whois the figure of him that was to come but not as the offence so also is the free gift for if throughthe offence of one many be dead much more the grace of god and thegift by grace which is by one man jesus christ hath abounded untomany and not as it was by one that sinned so is the gift for thejudgment was by one to condemnation but the free gift is of manyoffences unto justification for if by one mans offence death reigned by one much more theywhich receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousnessshall reign in life by one jesus christ   therefore as by theoffence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation even so bythe righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men untojustification of life for as by one mans disobedience many were made sinners so bythe obedience of one shall many be made righteous moreover the law entered that the offence might abound butwhere sin abounded grace did much more abound  that as sin hathreigned unto death even so might grace reign through righteousnessunto eternal life by jesus christ our lord what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that grace mayabound   god forbid how shall we that are dead to sin live anylonger therein   know ye not that so many of us as were baptizedinto jesus christ were baptized into his death   therefore we areburied with him by baptism into death that like as christ was raisedup from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also shouldwalk in newness of life for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his deathwe shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection  knowingthis that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sinmight be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin for he that is dead is freed from sin now if we be dead with christ we believe that we shall also livewith him  knowing that christ being raised from the dead dieth nomore death hath no more dominion over him for in that he died he died unto sin once but in that heliveth he liveth unto god likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sinbut alive unto god through jesus christ our lord let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that ye shouldobey it in the lusts thereof neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousnessunto sin but yield yourselves unto god as those that are alive fromthe dead and your members as instruments of righteousness unto god for sin shall not have dominion over you for ye are not underthe law but under grace what then shall we sin because we are not under the law butunder grace god forbid know ye not that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obeyhis servants ye are to whom ye obey whether of sin unto death or ofobedience unto righteousness   but god be thanked that ye werethe servants of sin but ye have obeyed from the heart that form ofdoctrine which was delivered you being then made free from sin ye became the servants ofrighteousness i speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of yourflesh for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness andto iniquity unto iniquity even so now yield your members servants torighteousness unto holiness for when ye were the servants of sin ye were free fromrighteousness what fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are nowashamed  for the end of those things is death but now being made free from sin and become servants to god yehave your fruit unto holiness and the end everlasting life for the wages of sin is death but the gift of god is eternallife through jesus christ our lord know ye not brethren for i speak to them that know the lawhow that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth  for the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husbandso long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loosed fromthe law of her husband so then if while her husband liveth she be married to anotherman she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be deadshe is free from that law so that she is no adulteress though she bemarried to another man wherefore my brethren ye also are become dead to the law by thebody of christ that ye should be married to another even to him whois raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto god for when we were in the flesh the motions of sins which were bythe law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death but now we are delivered from the law that being dead wherein wewere held that we should serve in newness of spirit and not in theoldness of the letter what shall we say then is the law sin god forbid nay i had notknown sin but by the law for i had not known lust except the lawhad said thou shalt not covet but sin taking occasion by the commandment wrought in me allmanner of concupiscence for without the law sin was dead for i was alive without the law once but when the commandmentcame sin revived and i died and the commandment which was ordained to life i found to beunto death for sin taking occasion by the commandment deceived me and byit slew me wherefore the law is holy and the commandment holy and justand good was then that which is good made death unto me god forbid butsin that it might appear sin working death in me by that which isgood that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful for we know that the law is spiritual but i am carnal soldunder sin for that which i do i allow not for what i would that do i notbut what i hate that do i if then i do that which i would not i consent unto the law thatit is good now then it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me for i know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no goodthing for to will is present with me but how to perform that whichis good i find not for the good that i would i do not but the evil which i wouldnot that i do now if i do that i would not it is no more i that do it but sinthat dwelleth in me i find then a law that when i would do good evil is presentwith me for i delight in the law of god after the inward man  but isee another law in my members warring against the law of my mind andbringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members o wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from the body ofthis death   i thank god through jesus christ our lord so thenwith the mind i myself serve the law of god but with the flesh thelaw of sin there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christjesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus hath made mefree from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do in that it was weak through theflesh god sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh andfor sin condemned sin in the flesh  that the righteousness of thelaw might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but afterthe spirit for they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the fleshbut they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually mindedis life and peace because the carnal mind is enmity against god for it is notsubject to the law of god neither indeed can be so then they that are in the flesh cannot please god but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that thespirit of god dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit ofchrist he is none of his and if christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but thespirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwellin you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken yourmortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to liveafter the flesh for if ye live after the flesh ye shall die but if ye throughthe spirit do mortify the deeds of the body ye shall live for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons ofgod for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear butye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we arethe children of god  and if children then heirs heirs of godand jointheirs with christ if so be that we suffer with him that wemay be also glorified together for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are notworthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for themanifestation of the sons of god for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly butby reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope  because thecreature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruptioninto the glorious liberty of the children of god for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth inpain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the firstfruitsof the spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting forthe adoption to wit the redemption of our body for we are saved by hope but hope that is seen is not hope forwhat a man seeth why doth he yet hope for   but if we hope forthat we see not then do we with patience wait for it likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities for we know notwhat we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself makethintercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of thespirit because he maketh intercession for the saints according to thewill of god and we know that all things work together for good to them thatlove god to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate to beconformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstbornamong many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whomhe called them he also justified and whom he justified them he alsoglorified what shall we then say to these things if god be for us who canbe against us   he that spared not his own son but delivered himup for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us allthings   who shall lay any thing to the charge of gods elect itis god that justifieth who is he that condemneth it is christ that died yea ratherthat is risen again who is even at the right hand of god who alsomaketh intercession for us who shall separate us from the love of christ shall tribulationor distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril orsword   as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the daylong we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through himthat loved us for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels norprincipalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able toseparate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord i say the truth in christ i lie not my conscience also bearingme witness in the holy ghost  that i have great heaviness andcontinual sorrow in my heart for i could wish that myself were accursed from christ for mybrethren my kinsmen according to the flesh  who are israelitesto whom pertaineth the adoption and the glory and the covenants andthe giving of the law and the service of god and the promises whose are the fathers and of whom as concerning the flesh christcame who is over all god blessed for ever amen not as though the word of god hath taken none effect for they arenot all israel which are of israel  neither because they are theseed of abraham are they all children but in isaac shall thy seedbe called that is they which are the children of the flesh these are notthe children of god but the children of the promise are counted forthe seed for this is the word of promise at this time will i come andsarah shall have a son and not only this but when rebecca also had conceived by oneeven by our father isaac  for the children being not yet bornneither having done any good or evil that the purpose of godaccording to election might stand not of works but of him thatcalleth  it was said unto her the elder shall serve theyounger as it is written jacob have i loved but esau have i hated what shall we say then is there unrighteousness with god godforbid for he saith to moses i will have mercy on whom i will havemercy and i will have compassion on whom i will have compassion so then it is not of him that willeth nor of him that runnethbut of god that sheweth mercy for the scripture saith unto pharaoh even for this same purposehave i raised thee up that i might shew my power in thee and that myname might be declared throughout all the earth therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy and whom hewill he hardeneth thou wilt say then unto me why doth he yet find fault for whohath resisted his will   nay but o man who art thou thatrepliest against god shall the thing formed say to him that formedit why hast thou made me thus   hath not the potter power overthe clay of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour and anotherunto dishonour   what if god willing to shew his wrath and tomake his power known endured with much longsuffering the vessels ofwrath fitted to destruction  and that he might make known theriches of his glory on the vessels of mercy which he had aforeprepared unto glory  even us whom he hath called not of thejews only but also of the gentiles   as he saith also in osee iwill call them my people which were not my people and her belovedwhich was not beloved and it shall come to pass that in the place where it was saidunto them ye are not my people there shall they be called thechildren of the living god esaias also crieth concerning israel though the number of thechildren of israel be as the sand of the sea a remnant shall besaved  for he will finish the work and cut it short inrighteousness because a short work will the lord make upon the earth and as esaias said before except the lord of sabaoth had left usa seed we had been as sodoma and been made like unto gomorrha what shall we say then that the gentiles which followed notafter righteousness have attained to righteousness even therighteousness which is of faith but israel which followed after the law of righteousness hathnot attained to the law of righteousness wherefore because they sought it not by faith but as it were bythe works of the law for they stumbled at that stumblingstone as it is written behold i lay in sion a stumblingstone and rock ofoffence and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed brethren my hearts desire and prayer to god for israel is thatthey might be saved for i bear them record that they have a zeal of god but notaccording to knowledge for they being ignorant of gods righteousness and going aboutto establish their own righteousness have not submitted themselvesunto the righteousness of god for christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every onethat believeth for moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law thatthe man which doeth those things shall live by them but the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wisesay not in thine heart who shall ascend into heaven that is tobring christ down from above  or who shall descend into thedeep that is to bring up christ again from the dead   butwhat saith it the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in thyheart that is the word of faith which we preach  that if thoushalt confess with thy mouth the lord jesus and shalt believe inthine heart that god hath raised him from the dead thou shalt besaved for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and withthe mouth confession is made unto salvation for the scripture saith whosoever believeth on him shall not beashamed for there is no difference between the jew and the greek forthe same lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him for whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall besaved how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believedand how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard and howshall they hear without a preacher   and how shall they preachexcept they be sent as it is written how beautiful are the feet ofthem that preach the gospel of peace and bring glad tidings of goodthings   but they have not all obeyed the gospel for esaiassaith lord who hath believed our report   so then faith comethby hearing and hearing by the word of god but i say have they not heard yes verily their sound wentinto all the earth and their words unto the ends of the world but i say did not israel know first moses saith i willprovoke you to jealousy by them that are no people and by a foolishnation i will anger you but esaias is very bold and saith i was found of them thatsought me not i was made manifest unto them that asked not after me but to israel he saith all day long i have stretched forth myhands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people i say then hath god cast away his people god forbid for i alsoam an israelite of the seed of abraham of the tribe of benjamin god hath not cast away his people which he foreknew wot ye notwhat the scripture saith of elias how he maketh intercession to godagainst israel saying  lord they have killed thy prophets anddigged down thine altars and i am left alone and they seek my life but what saith the answer of god unto him i have reserved tomyself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to the image ofbaal even so then at this present time also there is a remnantaccording to the election of grace and if by grace then is it no more of works otherwise grace isno more grace but if it be of works then it is no more graceotherwise work is no more work what then israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh forbut the election hath obtained it and the rest were blinded according as it is written god hath given them the spirit ofslumber eyes that they should not see and ears that they should nothear unto this day and david saith let their table be made a snare and a trap anda stumblingblock and a recompence unto them  let their eyes bedarkened that they may not see and bow down their back alway i say then have they stumbled that they should fall godforbid but rather through their fall salvation is come unto thegentiles for to provoke them to jealousy now if the fall of them be the riches of the world and thediminishing of them the riches of the gentiles how much more theirfulness   for i speak to you gentiles inasmuch as i am theapostle of the gentiles i magnify mine office  if by any meansi may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh and might savesome of them for if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the worldwhat shall the receiving of them be but life from the dead  for if the firstfruit be holy the lump is also holy and if the rootbe holy so are the branches and if some of the branches be broken off and thou being awild olive tree wert graffed in among them and with them partakestof the root and fatness of the olive tree  boast not against thebranches but if thou boast thou bearest not the root but the rootthee thou wilt say then the branches were broken off that i mightbe graffed in well because of unbelief they were broken off and thoustandest by faith be not highminded but fear  for if godspared not the natural branches take heed lest he also spare notthee behold therefore the goodness and severity of god on them whichfell severity but toward thee goodness if thou continue in hisgoodness otherwise thou also shalt be cut off and they also if they abide not still in unbelief shall begraffed in for god is able to graff them in again for if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild bynature and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive treehow much more shall these which be the natural branches be graffedinto their own olive tree   for i would not brethren that yeshould be ignorant of this mystery lest ye should be wise in your ownconceits that blindness in part is happened to israel until thefulness of the gentiles be come in and so all israel shall be saved as it is written there shallcome out of sion the deliverer and shall turn away ungodliness fromjacob  for this is my covenant unto them when i shall take awaytheir sins as concerning the gospel they are enemies for your sakes butas touching the election they are beloved for the fathers sakes for the gifts and calling of god are without repentance for as ye in times past have not believed god yet have nowobtained mercy through their unbelief  even so have these alsonow not believed that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy for god hath concluded them all in unbelief that he might havemercy upon all o the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge ofgod  how unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past findingout   for who hath known the mind of the lord or who hath beenhis counsellor   or who hath first given to him and it shall berecompensed unto him again   for of him and through him and tohim are all things to whom be glory for ever amen i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that yepresent your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto godwhich is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by therenewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good andacceptable and perfect will of god for i say through the grace given unto me to every man that isamong you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to thinkbut to think soberly according as god hath dealt to every man themeasure of faith for as we have many members in one body and all members have notthe same office  so we being many are one body in christ andevery one members one of another having then gifts differing according to the grace that is givento us whether prophecy let us prophesy according to the proportionof faith  or ministry let us wait on our ministering or he thatteacheth on teaching  or he that exhorteth on exhortation hethat giveth let him do it with simplicity he that ruleth withdiligence he that sheweth mercy with cheerfulness let love be without dissimulation abhor that which is evilcleave to that which is good be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love inhonour preferring one another  not slothful in business ferventin spirit serving the lord  rejoicing in hope patient intribulation continuing instant in prayer  distributing to thenecessity of saints given to hospitality bless them which persecute you bless and curse not rejoice with them that do rejoice and weep with them that weep be of the same mind one toward another mind not high thingsbut condescend to men of low estate be not wise in your own conceits recompense to no man evil for evil provide things honest in thesight of all men if it be possible as much as lieth in you live peaceably withall men dearly beloved avenge not yourselves but rather give placeunto wrath for it is written vengeance is mine i will repay saiththe lord therefore if thine enemy hunger feed him if he thirst givehim drink for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head be not overcome of evil but overcome evil with good let every soul be subject unto the higher powers for there is nopower but of god the powers that be are ordained of god whosoever therefore resisteth the power resisteth the ordinanceof god and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation for rulers are not a terror to good works but to the evil wiltthou then not be afraid of the power do that which is good and thoushalt have praise of the same  for he is the minister of god tothee for good but if thou do that which is evil be afraid for hebeareth not the sword in vain for he is the minister of god arevenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil wherefore ye must needs be subject not only for wrath but alsofor conscience sake for for this cause pay ye tribute also for they are godsministers attending continually upon this very thing render therefore to all their dues tribute to whom tribute isdue custom to whom custom fear to whom fear honour to whom honour owe no man any thing but to love one another for he that lovethanother hath fulfilled the law for this thou shalt not commit adultery thou shalt not killthou shalt not steal thou shalt not bear false witness thou shaltnot covet and if there be any other commandment it is brieflycomprehended in this saying namely thou shalt love thy neighbour asthyself love worketh no ill to his neighbour therefore love is thefulfilling of the law and that knowing the time that now it is high time to awakeout of sleep for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed the night is far spent the day is at hand let us thereforecast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armour of light let us walk honestly as in the day not in rioting anddrunkenness not in chambering and wantonness not in strife andenvying but put ye on the lord jesus christ and make not provision forthe flesh to fulfil the lusts thereof him that is weak in the faith receive ye but not to doubtfuldisputations for one believeth that he may eat all things another who isweak eateth herbs let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not and let nothim which eateth not judge him that eateth for god hath received him who art thou that judgest another mans servant to his ownmaster he standeth or falleth yea he shall be holden up for god isable to make him stand one man esteemeth one day above another another esteemeth everyday alike let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind he that regardeth the day regardeth it unto the lord and hethat regardeth not the day to the lord he doth not regard it he thateateth eateth to the lord for he giveth god thanks and he thateateth not to the lord he eateth not and giveth god thanks for none of us liveth to himself and no man dieth to himself for whether we live we live unto the lord and whether we diewe die unto the lord whether we live therefore or die we are thelords for to this end christ both died and rose and revived that hemight be lord both of the dead and living but why dost thou judge thy brother or why dost thou set atnought thy brother for we shall all stand before the judgment seat ofchrist for it is written as i live saith the lord every knee shallbow to me and every tongue shall confess to god so then every one of us shall give account of himself to god let us not therefore judge one another any more but judge thisrather that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in hisbrothers way i know and am persuaded by the lord jesus that there isnothing unclean of itself but to him that esteemeth any thing to beunclean to him it is unclean but if thy brother be grieved with thy meat now walkest thounot charitably destroy not him with thy meat for whom christ died let not then your good be evil spoken of  for the kingdomof god is not meat and drink but righteousness and peace and joy inthe holy ghost for he that in these things serveth christ is acceptable to godand approved of men let us therefore follow after the things which make for peaceand things wherewith one may edify another for meat destroy not the work of god all things indeed arepure but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence it is good neither to eat flesh nor to drink wine nor anything whereby thy brother stumbleth or is offended or is made weak hast thou faith have it to thyself before god happy is he thatcondemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth and he that doubteth is damned if he eat because he eateth notof faith for whatsoever is not of faith is sin we then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of theweak and not to please ourselves let every one of us please his neighbour for his good toedification for even christ pleased not himself but as it is written thereproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me for whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for ourlearning that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures mighthave hope now the god of patience and consolation grant you to belikeminded one toward another according to christ jesus  that yemay with one mind and one mouth glorify god even the father of ourlord jesus christ wherefore receive ye one another as christ also received us tothe glory of god now i say that jesus christ was a minister of the circumcisionfor the truth of god to confirm the promises made unto the fathers and that the gentiles might glorify god for his mercy as it iswritten for this cause i will confess to thee among the gentiles andsing unto thy name and again he saith rejoice ye gentiles with his people and again praise the lord all ye gentiles and laud him allye people and again esaias saith there shall be a root of jesse and hethat shall rise to reign over the gentiles in him shall the gentilestrust now the god of hope fill you with all joy and peace inbelieving that ye may abound in hope through the power of the holyghost and i myself also am persuaded of you my brethren that ye alsoare full of goodness filled with all knowledge able also to admonishone another nevertheless brethren i have written the more boldly unto youin some sort as putting you in mind because of the grace that isgiven to me of god  that i should be the minister of jesuschrist to the gentiles ministering the gospel of god that theoffering up of the gentiles might be acceptable being sanctified bythe holy ghost i have therefore whereof i may glory through jesus christ inthose things which pertain to god for i will not dare to speak of any of those things which christhath not wrought by me to make the gentiles obedient by word anddeed  through mighty signs and wonders by the power of thespirit of god so that from jerusalem and round about unto illyricumi have fully preached the gospel of christ yea so have i strived to preach the gospel not where christwas named lest i should build upon another mans foundation but as it is written to whom he was not spoken of they shall seeand they that have not heard shall understand for which cause also i have been much hindered from coming toyou but now having no more place in these parts and having a greatdesire these many years to come unto you  whensoever i take myjourney into spain i will come to you for i trust to see you in myjourney and to be brought on my way thitherward by you if first i besomewhat filled with your company but now i go unto jerusalem to minister unto the saints for it hath pleased them of macedonia and achaia to make acertain contribution for the poor saints which are at jerusalem it hath pleased them verily and their debtors they are for ifthe gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things theirduty is also to minister unto them in carnal things when therefore i have performed this and have sealed to themthis fruit i will come by you into spain and i am sure that when i come unto you i shall come in thefulness of the blessing of the gospel of christ now i beseech you brethren for the lord jesus christs sakeand for the love of the spirit that ye strive together with me inyour prayers to god for me  that i may be delivered from themthat do not believe in judaea and that my service which i have forjerusalem may be accepted of the saints  that i may come untoyou with joy by the will of god and may with you be refreshed now the god of peace be with you all amen i commend unto you phebe our

saluteth you and quartus a brother the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you all amen now to him that is of power to stablish you according to mygospel and the preaching of jesus christ according to the revelationof the mystery which was kept secret since the world began  butnow is made manifest and by the scriptures of the prophets accordingto the commandment of the everlasting god made known to all nationsfor the obedience of faith  to god only wise be glory throughjesus christ for ever amenthe first epistle of paul the apostle to the corinthians paul called to be an apostle of jesus christ through the will ofgod and sosthenes our brother  unto the church of god which is atcorinth to them that are sanctified in christ jesus called to besaints with all that in every place call upon the name of jesuschrist our lord both theirs and ours  grace be unto you andpeace from god our father and from the lord jesus christ i thank my god always on your behalf for the grace of god whichis given you by jesus christ  that in every thing ye are enrichedby him in all utterance and in all knowledge  even as thetestimony of christ was confirmed in you  so that ye come behindin no gift waiting for the coming of our lord jesus christ  whoshall also confirm you unto the end that ye may be blameless in theday of our lord jesus christ god is faithful by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of hisson jesus christ our lord now i beseech you brethren by the name of our lord jesuschrist that ye all speak the same thing and that there be nodivisions among you but that ye be perfectly joined together in thesame mind and in the same judgment for it hath been declared unto me of you my brethren by themwhich are of the house of chloe that there are contentions among you now this i say that every one of you saith i am of paul and iof apollos and i of cephas and i of christ is christ divided was paul crucified for you or were yebaptized in the name of paul   i thank god that i baptized noneof you but crispus and gaius  lest any should say that i hadbaptized in mine own name and i baptized also the household of stephanas besides i knownot whether i baptized any other for christ sent me not to baptize but to preach the gospel notwith wisdom of words lest the cross of christ should be made of noneeffect for the preaching of the cross is to them that perishfoolishness but unto us which are saved it is the power of god for it is written i will destroy the wisdom of the wise andwill bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent where is the wise where is the scribe where is the disputer ofthis world hath not god made foolish the wisdom of this world  for after that in the wisdom of god the world by wisdom knew not godit pleased god by the foolishness of preaching to save them thatbelieve for the jews require a sign and the greeks seek after wisdom but we preach christ crucified unto the jews a stumblingblockand unto the greeks foolishness  but unto them which are calledboth jews and greeks christ the power of god and the wisdom of god because the foolishness of god is wiser than men and theweakness of god is stronger than men for ye see your calling brethren how that not many wise menafter the flesh not many mighty not many noble are called  butgod hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wiseand god hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound thethings which are mighty  and base things of the world and thingswhich are despised hath god chosen yea and things which are not tobring to nought things that are  that no flesh should glory inhis presence but of him are ye in christ jesus who of god is made unto uswisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption that according as it is written he that glorieth let him glory inthe lord and i brethren when i came to you came not with excellency ofspeech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of god for i determined not to know any thing among you save jesuschrist and him crucified and i was with you in weakness and in fear and in muchtrembling and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words ofmans wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of power that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in thepower of god howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not thewisdom of this world nor of the princes of this world that come tonought  but we speak the wisdom of god in a mystery even thehidden wisdom which god ordained before the world unto our glory which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known itthey would not have crucified the lord of glory but as it is written eye hath not seen nor ear heard neitherhave entered into the heart of man the things which god hath preparedfor them that love him but god hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spiritsearcheth all things yea the deep things of god for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of manwhich is in him even so the things of god knoweth no man but thespirit of god now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spiritwhich is of god that we might know the things that are freely givento us of god which things also we speak not in the words which mans wisdomteacheth but which the holy ghost teacheth comparing spiritualthings with spiritual but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit ofgod for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know thembecause they are spiritually discerned but he that is spiritual judgeth all things yet he himself isjudged of no man for who hath known the mind of the lord that he may instructhim  but we have the mind of christ and i brethren could not speak unto you as unto spiritual butas unto carnal even as unto babes in christ i have fed you with milk and not with meat for hitherto ye werenot able to bear it neither yet now are ye able for ye are yet carnal for whereas there is among you envying andstrife and divisions are ye not carnal and walk as men   forwhile one saith i am of paul and another i am of apollos are yenot carnal   who then is paul and who is apollos but ministersby whom ye believed even as the lord gave to every man   i haveplanted apollos watered but god gave the increase so then neither is he that planteth any thing neither he thatwatereth but god that giveth the increase now he that planteth and he that watereth are one and every manshall receive his own reward according to his own labour for we are labourers together with god ye are gods husbandry yeare gods building according to the grace of god which is given unto me as a wisemasterbuilder i have laid the foundation and another buildeththereon but let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon for other foundation can no man lay than that is laid which isjesus christ now if any man build upon this foundation gold silver preciousstones wood hay stubble  every mans work shall be mademanifest for the day shall declare it because it shall be revealedby fire and the fire shall try every mans work of what sort it is if any mans work abide which he hath built thereupon he shallreceive a reward if any mans work shall be burned he shall suffer loss but hehimself shall be saved yet so as by fire know ye not that ye are the temple of god and that the spirit ofgod dwelleth in you   if any man defile the temple of god himshall god destroy for the temple of god is holy which temple ye are let no man deceive himself if any man among you seemeth to bewise in this world let him become a fool that he may be wise for the wisdom of this world is foolishness with god for it iswritten he taketh the wise in their own craftiness and again the lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise that theyare vain therefore let no man glory in men for all things are yours whether paul or apollos or cephas or the world or life ordeath or things present or things to come all are yours  andye are christs and christ is gods let a man so account of us as of the ministers of christ andstewards of the mysteries of god moreover it is required in stewards that a man be found faithful but with me it is a very small thing that i should be judged ofyou or of mans judgment yea i judge not mine own self for i know nothing by myself yet am i not hereby justified buthe that judgeth me is the lord therefore judge nothing before the time until the lord come whoboth will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and will makemanifest the counsels of the hearts and then shall every man havepraise of god and these things brethren i have in a figure transferred tomyself and to apollos for your sakes that ye might learn in us not tothink of men above that which is written that no one of you be puffedup for one against another for who maketh thee to differ from another and what hast thouthat thou didst not receive now if thou didst receive it why dostthou glory as if thou hadst not received it   now ye are fullnow ye are rich ye have reigned as kings without us and i would togod ye did reign that we also might reign with you for i think that god hath set forth us the apostles last as itwere appointed to death for we are made a spectacle unto the worldand to angels and to men we are fools for christs sake but ye are wise in christ we areweak but ye are strong ye are honourable but we are despised even unto this present hour we both hunger and thirst and arenaked and are buffeted and have no certain dwellingplace  andlabour working with our own hands being reviled we bless beingpersecuted we suffer it  being defamed we intreat we are madeas the filth of the world and are the offscouring of all things untothis day i write not these things to shame you but as my beloved sons iwarn you for though ye have ten thousand instructers in christ yet haveye not many fathers for in christ jesus i have begotten you throughthe gospel wherefore i beseech you be ye followers of me for this cause have i sent unto you timotheus who is my belovedson and faithful in the lord who shall bring you into remembrance ofmy ways which be in christ as i teach every where in every church now some are puffed up as though i would not come to you but i will come to you shortly if the lord will and will knownot the speech of them which are puffed up but the power for the kingdom of god is not in word but in power what will ye shall i come unto you with a rod or in love andin the spirit of meekness   it is reported commonly that there isfornication among you and such fornication as is not so much as namedamong the gentiles that one should have his fathers wife and ye are puffed up and have not rather mourned that he thathath done this deed might be taken away from among you for i verily as absent in body but present in spirit havejudged already as though i were present concerning him that hath sodone this deed  in the name of our lord jesus christ when ye aregathered together and my spirit with the power of our lord jesuschrist  to deliver such an one unto satan for the destruction ofthe flesh that the spirit may be saved in the day of the lord jesus your glorying is not good know ye not that a little leavenleaveneth the whole lump   purge out therefore the old leaventhat ye may be a new lump as ye are unleavened for even christ ourpassover is sacrificed for us  therefore let us keep the feastnot with old leaven neither with the leaven of malice and wickednessbut with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth i wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world or withthe covetous or extortioners or with idolaters for then must yeneeds go out of the world but now i have written unto you not to keep company if any manthat is called a brother be a fornicator or covetous or an idolateror a railer or a drunkard or an extortioner with such an one no notto eat for what have i to do to judge them also that are without do notye judge them that are within   but them that are without godjudgeth therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person dare any of you having a matter against another go to law beforethe unjust and not before the saints   do ye not know that thesaints shall judge the world and if the world shall be judged by youare ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters   know ye not thatwe shall judge angels how much more things that pertain to this life if then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life setthem to judge who are least esteemed in the church i speak to your shame is it so that there is not a wise manamong you no not one that shall be able to judge between hisbrethren   but brother goeth to law with brother and that beforethe unbelievers now therefore there is utterly a fault among you because ye go tolaw one with another why do ye not rather take wrong why do ye notrather suffer yourselves to be defrauded   nay ye do wrong anddefraud and that your brethren know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom ofgod  be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolaters noradulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves with mankind nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor revilers norextortioners shall inherit the kingdom of god and such were some of you but ye are washed but ye aresanctified but ye are justified in the name of the lord jesus and bythe spirit of our god all things are lawful unto me but all things are not expedientall things are lawful for me but i will not be brought under thepower of any meats for the belly and the belly for meats but god shalldestroy both it and them now the body is not for fornication but forthe lord and the lord for the body and god hath both raised up the lord and will also raise up usby his own power know ye not that your bodies are the members of christ shall ithen take the members of christ and make them the members of anharlot god forbid what know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is onebody  for two saith he shall be one flesh but he that is joined unto the lord is one spirit flee fornication every sin that a man doeth is without the bodybut he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body what know ye not that your body is the temple of the holy ghostwhich is in you which ye have of god and ye are not your own  for ye are bought with a price therefore glorify god in your bodyand in your spirit which are gods now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me it is good fora man not to touch a woman nevertheless to avoid fornication let every man have his ownwife and let every woman have her own husband let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence and likewisealso the wife unto the husband the wife hath not power of her own body but the husband andlikewise also the husband hath not power of his own body but thewife defraud ye not one the other except it be with consent for atime that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer and cometogether again that satan tempt you not for your incontinency but i speak this by permission and not of commandment for i would that all men were even as i myself but every man hathhis proper gift of god one after this manner and another after that i say therefore to the unmarried and widows it is good for themif they abide even as i but if they cannot contain let them marry for it is better tomarry than to burn and unto the married i command yet not i but the lord let notthe wife depart from her husband  but and if she depart let herremain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband and let not thehusband put away his wife but to the rest speak i not the lord if any brother hath a wifethat believeth not and she be pleased to dwell with him let him notput her away and the woman which hath an husband that believeth not and if hebe pleased to dwell with her let her not leave him for the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife and theunbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband else were your childrenunclean but now are they holy but if the unbelieving depart let him depart a brother or asister is not under bondage in such cases but god hath called us topeace for what knowest thou o wife whether thou shalt save thyhusband  or how knowest thou o man whether thou shalt save thywife   but as god hath distributed to every man as the lord hathcalled every one so let him walk and so ordain i in all churches is any man called being circumcised let him not becomeuncircumcised is any called in uncircumcision let him not becircumcised circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing but thekeeping of the commandments of god let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called art thou called being a servant care not for it but if thoumayest be made free use it rather for he that is called in the lord being a servant is the lordsfreeman likewise also he that is called being free is christsservant ye are bought with a price be not ye the servants of men brethren let every man wherein he is called therein abide withgod now concerning virgins i have no commandment of the lord yet igive my judgment as one that hath obtained mercy of the lord to befaithful i suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress isay that it is good for a man so to be art thou bound unto a wife seek not to be loosed art thouloosed from a wife seek not a wife but and if thou marry thou hast not sinned and if a virginmarry she hath not sinned nevertheless such shall have trouble inthe flesh but i spare you but this i say brethren the time is short it remaineth thatboth they that have wives be as though they had none  and theythat weep as though they wept not and they that rejoice as thoughthey rejoiced not and they that buy as though they possessed not and they that use this world as not abusing it for the fashionof this world passeth away but i would have you without carefulness he that is unmarriedcareth for the things that belong to the lord how he may please thelord  but he that is married careth for the things that are ofthe world how he may please his wife there is difference also between a wife and a virgin theunmarried woman careth for the things of the lord that she may beholy both in body and in spirit but she that is married careth forthe things of the world how she may please her husband and this i speak for your own profit not that i may cast a snareupon you but for that which is comely and that ye may attend uponthe lord without distraction but if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward hisvirgin if she pass the flower of her age and need so require lethim do what he will he sinneth not let them marry nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart having nonecessity but hath power over his own will and hath so decreed inhis heart that he will keep his virgin doeth well so then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well but he thatgiveth her not in marriage doeth better the wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth butif her husband be dead she is at liberty to be married to whom shewill only in the lord but she is happier if she so abide after my judgment and ithink also that i have the spirit of god now as touching things offered unto idols we know that we allhave knowledge knowledge puffeth up but charity edifieth and if any man think that he knoweth any thing he knoweth nothingyet as he ought to know but if any man love god the same is known of him as concerning therefore the eating of those things that areoffered in sacrifice unto idols we know that an idol is nothing inthe world and that there is none other god but one for though there be that are called gods whether in heaven or inearth as there be gods many and lords many  but to us there isbut one god the father of whom are all things and we in him andone lord jesus christ by whom are all things and we by him howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge for some withconscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered untoan idol and their conscience being weak is defiled but meat commendeth us not to god for neither if we eat are wethe better neither if we eat not are we the worse but take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become astumblingblock to them that are weak for if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in theidols temple shall not the conscience of him which is weak beemboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols  andthrough thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish for whom christdied   but when ye sin so against the brethren and wound theirweak conscience ye sin against christ wherefore if meat make my brother to offend i will eat no fleshwhile the world standeth lest i make my brother to offend am i not an apostle am i not free have i not seen jesus christour lord are not ye my work in the lord   if i be not an apostleunto others yet doubtless i am to you for the seal of mineapostleship are ye in the lord mine answer to them that do examine me is this  have we notpower to eat and to drink   have we not power to lead about asister a wife as well as other apostles and as the brethren of thelord and cephas   or i only and barnabas have not we power toforbear working   who goeth a warfare any time at his own chargeswho planteth a vineyard and eateth not of the fruit thereof or whofeedeth a flock and eateth not of the milk of the flock   say ithese things as a man or saith not the law the same also   for itis written in the law of moses thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of theox that treadeth out the corn doth god take care for oxen   orsaith he it altogether for our sakes for our sakes no doubt this iswritten that he that ploweth should plow in hope and that he thatthresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope if we have sown unto you spiritual things is it a great thing ifwe shall reap your carnal things   if others be partakers of thispower over you are not we rather  nevertheless we have not used thispower but suffer all things lest we should hinder the gospel ofchrist do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live ofthe things of the temple and they which wait at the altar arepartakers with the altar   even so hath the lord ordained thatthey which preach the gospel should live of the gospel but i have used none of these things neither have i writtenthese things that it should be so done unto me for it were betterfor me to die than that any man should make my glorying void for though i preach the gospel i have nothing to glory of fornecessity is laid upon me yea woe is unto me if i preach not thegospel   for if i do this thing willingly i have a reward butif against my will a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me what is my reward then verily that when i preach the gospel imay make the gospel of christ without charge that i abuse not mypower in the gospel for though i be free from all men yet have i made myself servantunto all that i might gain the more and unto the jews i became as a jew that i might gain the jewsto them that are under the law as under the law that i might gainthem that are under the law  to them that are without law aswithout law being not without law to god but under the law tochrist that i might gain them that are without law to the weak became i as weak that i might gain the weak i ammade all things to all men that i might by all means save some and this i do for the gospels sake that i might be partakerthereof with you know ye not that they which run in a race run all but onereceiveth the prize so run that ye may obtain and every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in allthings now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown but we anincorruptible i therefore so run not as uncertainly so fight i not as onethat beateth the air  but i keep under my body and bring it intosubjection lest that by any means when i have preached to others imyself should be a castaway moreover brethren i would not that ye should be ignorant howthat all our fathers were under the cloud and all passed through thesea  and were all baptized unto moses in the cloud and in thesea  and did all eat the same spiritual meat  and did alldrink the same spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual rockthat followed them and that rock was christ but with many of them god was not well pleased for they wereoverthrown in the wilderness now these things were our examples to the intent we should notlust after evil things as they also lusted neither be ye idolaters as were some of them as it is writtenthe people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play neither let us commit fornication as some of them committed andfell in one day three and twenty thousand neither let us tempt christ as some of them also tempted andwere destroyed of serpents neither murmur ye as some of them also murmured and weredestroyed of the destroyer now all these things happened unto them for ensamples and theyare written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world arecome wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest hefall there hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to manbut god is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above thatye are able but will with the temptation also make a way to escapethat ye may be able to bear it wherefore my dearly beloved flee from idolatry i speak as to wise men judge ye what i say the cup of blessing which we bless is it not the communion ofthe blood of christ the bread which we break is it not the communionof the body of christ   for we being many are one bread and onebody for we are all partakers of that one bread behold israel after the flesh are not they which eat of thesacrifices partakers of the altar   what say i then that theidol is any thing or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols isany thing   but i say that the things which the gentilessacrifice they sacrifice to devils and not to god and i would notthat ye should have fellowship with devils ye cannot drink the cup of the lord and the cup of devils yecannot be partakers of the lords table and of the table of devils do we provoke the lord to jealousy are we stronger than he all things are lawful for me but all things are not expedientall things are lawful for me but all things edify not let no man seek his own but every man anothers wealth whatsoever is sold in the shambles that eat asking no questionfor conscience sake  for the earth is the lords and thefulness thereof if any of them that believe not bid you to a feast and ye bedisposed to go whatsoever is set before you eat asking no questionfor conscience sake but if any man say unto you this is offered in sacrifice untoidols eat not for his sake that shewed it and for conscience sakefor the earth is the lords and the fulness thereof conscience i say not thine own but of the other for why is myliberty judged of another mans conscience   for if i by gracebe a partaker why am i evil spoken of for that for which i givethanks   whether therefore ye eat or drink or whatsoever yedo do all to the glory of god give none offence neither to the jews nor to the gentiles norto the church of god  even as i please all men in all thingsnot seeking mine own profit but the profit of many that they may besaved be ye followers of me even as i also am of christ now i praise you brethren that ye remember me in all thingsand keep the ordinances as i delivered them to you but i would have you know that the head of every man is christand the head of the woman is the man and the head of christ is god every man praying or prophesying having his head covereddishonoureth his head but every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her headuncovered dishonoureth her head for that is even all one as if shewere shaven for if the woman be not covered let her also be shorn but if itbe a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven let her be covered for a man indeed ought not to cover his head forasmuch as he isthe image and glory of god but the woman is the glory of the man for the man is not of the woman but the woman of the man neither was the man created for the woman but the woman for theman for this cause ought the woman to have power on her head becauseof the angels nevertheless neither is the man without the woman neither thewoman without the man in the lord for as the woman is of the man even so is the man also by thewoman but all things of god judge in yourselves is it comely that a woman pray unto goduncovered   doth not even nature itself teach you that if aman have long hair it is a shame unto him   but if a woman havelong hair it is a glory to her for her hair is given her for acovering but if any man seem to be contentious we have no such customneither the churches of god now in this that i declare unto you i praise you not that yecome together not for the better but for the worse for first of all when ye come together in the church i hearthat there be divisions among you and i partly believe it for there must be also heresies among you that they which areapproved may be made manifest among you when ye come together therefore into one place this is not toeat the lords supper for in eating every one taketh before other his own supper andone is hungry and another is drunken what have ye not houses to eat and to drink in or despise yethe church of god and shame them that have not what shall i say toyou shall i praise you in this i praise you not for i have received of the lord that which also i delivered untoyou that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed tookbread  and when he had given thanks he brake it and saidtake eat this is my body which is broken for you this do inremembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had suppedsaying this cup is the new testament in my blood this do ye as oftas ye drink it in remembrance of me for as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup ye doshew the lords death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup ofthe lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of thelord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that breadand drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinkethdamnation to himself not discerning the lords body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and manysleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the lord that weshould not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when ye come together to eat tarry onefor another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that ye come nottogether unto condemnation and the rest will i set in order when icome now concerning spiritual gifts brethren i would not have youignorant ye know that ye were gentiles carried away unto these dumbidols even as ye were led wherefore i give you to understand that no man speaking by thespirit of god calleth jesus accursed and that no man can say thatjesus is the lord but by the holy ghost now there are diversities of gifts but the same spirit and there are differences of administrations but the same lord and there are diversities of operations but it is the same godwhich worketh all in all but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man toprofit withal for to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom to anotherthe word of knowledge by the same spirit  to another faith by thesame spirit to another the gifts of healing by the same spirit to another the working of miracles to another prophecy to anotherdiscerning of spirits to another divers kinds of tongues to anotherthe interpretation of tongues  but all these worketh that oneand the selfsame spirit dividing to every man severally as he will for as the body is one and hath many members and all themembers of that one body being many are one body so also is christ for by one spirit are we all baptized into one body whether webe jews or gentiles whether we be bond or free and have been allmade to drink into one spirit for the body is not one member but many if the foot shall say because i am not the hand i am not ofthe body is it therefore not of the body   and if the ear shallsay because i am not the eye i am not of the body is it thereforenot of the body   if the whole body were an eye where were thehearing if the whole were hearing where were the smelling  but now hath god set the members every one of them in the body as ithath pleased him and if they were all one member where were the body   butnow are they many members yet but one body and the eye cannot say unto the hand i have no need of theenor again the head to the feet i have no need of you nay much more those members of the body which seem to be morefeeble are necessary  and those members of the body which wethink to be less honourable upon these we bestow more abundanthonour and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness for our comely parts have no need but god hath tempered thebody together having given more abundant honour to that part whichlacked that there should be no schism in the body but that the membersshould have the same care one for another and whether one member suffer all the members suffer with itor one member be honoured all the members rejoice with it now ye are the body of christ and members in particular and god hath set some in the church first apostles secondarilyprophets thirdly teachers after that miracles then gifts ofhealings helps governments diversities of tongues are all apostles are all prophets are all teachers are allworkers of miracles   have all the gifts of healing do allspeak with tongues do all interpret   but covet earnestly thebest gifts and yet shew i unto you a more excellent way though i speak with the tongues of men and of angels and havenot charity i am become as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal and though i have the gift of prophecy and understand allmysteries and all knowledge and though i have all faith so that icould remove mountains and have not charity i am nothing and though i bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though igive my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth menothing charity suffereth long and is kind charity envieth not charityvaunteth not itself is not puffed up  doth not behave itselfunseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinketh noevil  rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things endurethall things charity never faileth but whether there be prophecies theyshall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether therebe knowledge it shall vanish away for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is inpart shall be done away when i was a child i spake as a child i understood as a childi thought as a child but when i became a man i put away childishthings for now we see through a glass darkly but then face to facenow i know in part but then shall i know even as also i am known and now abideth faith hope charity these three but thegreatest of these is charity follow after charity and desire spiritual gifts but rather thatye may prophesy for he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto menbut unto god for no man understandeth him howbeit in the spirit hespeaketh mysteries but he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification andexhortation and comfort he that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself but hethat prophesieth edifieth the church i would that ye all spake with tongues but rather that yeprophesied for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speakethwith tongues except he interpret that the church may receiveedifying now brethren if i come unto you speaking with tongues whatshall i profit you except i shall speak to you either by revelationor by knowledge or by prophesying or by doctrine   and eventhings without life giving sound whether pipe or harp except theygive a distinction in the sounds how shall it be known what is pipedor harped   for if the trumpet give an uncertain sound who shallprepare himself to the battle   so likewise ye except ye utterby the tongue words easy to be understood how shall it be known whatis spoken for ye shall speak into the air there are it may be so many kinds of voices in the world andnone of them is without signification therefore if i know not the meaning of the voice i shall beunto him that speaketh a barbarian and he that speaketh shall be abarbarian unto me even so ye forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts seekthat ye may excel to the edifying of the church wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray thathe may interpret for if i pray in an unknown tongue my spirit prayeth but myunderstanding is unfruitful what is it then i will pray with the spirit and i will praywith the understanding also i will sing with the spirit and i willsing with the understanding also else when thou shalt bless with the spirit how shall he thatoccupieth the room of the unlearned say amen at thy giving of thanksseeing he understandeth not what thou sayest   for thou verilygivest thanks well but the other is not edified i thank my god i speak with tongues more than ye all  yetin the church i had rather speak five words with my understandingthat by my voice i might teach others also than ten thousand words inan unknown tongue brethren be not children in understanding howbeit in malice beye children but in understanding be men in the law it is written with men of other tongues and otherlips will i speak unto this people and yet for all that will they nothear me saith the lord wherefore tongues are for a sign not to them that believe butto them that believe not but prophesying serveth not for them thatbelieve not but for them which believe if therefore the whole church be come together into one placeand all speak with tongues and there come in those that areunlearned or unbelievers will they not say that ye are mad  but if all prophesy and there come in one that believeth not or oneunlearned he is convinced of all he is judged of all  and thusare the secrets of his heart made manifest and so falling down on hisface he will worship god and report that god is in you of a truth how is it then brethren when ye come together every one ofyou hath a psalm hath a doctrine hath a tongue hath a revelationhath an interpretation let all things be done unto edifying if any man speak in an unknown tongue let it be by two or atthe most by three and that by course and let one interpret but if there be no interpreter let him keep silence in thechurch and let him speak to himself and to god let the prophets speak two or three and let the other judge if any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by let thefirst hold his peace for ye may all prophesy one by one that all may learn and allmay be comforted and the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets for god is not the author of confusion but of peace as in allchurches of the saints let your women keep silence in the churches for it is notpermitted unto them to speak but they are commanded to be underobedience as also saith the law and if they will learn any thing let them ask their husbands athome for it is a shame for women to speak in the church what came the word of god out from you or came it unto youonly   if any man think himself to be a prophet or spirituallet him acknowledge that the things that i write unto you are thecommandments of the lord but if any man be ignorant let him be ignorant wherefore brethren covet to prophesy and forbid not to speakwith tongues let all things be done decently and in order moreover brethren i declare unto you the gospel which ipreached unto you which also ye have received and wherein ye stand by which also ye are saved if ye keep in memory what i preachedunto you unless ye have believed in vain for i delivered unto you first of all that which i also receivedhow that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures and that he was buried and that he rose again the third day accordingto the scriptures  and that he was seen of cephas then of thetwelve  after that he was seen of above five hundred brethren atonce of whom the greater part remain unto this present but some arefallen asleep after that he was seen of james then of all the apostles and last of all he was seen of me also as of one born out of duetime for i am the least of the apostles that am not meet to be calledan apostle because i persecuted the church of god but by the grace of god i am what i am and his grace which wasbestowed upon me was not in vain but i laboured more abundantly thanthey all yet not i but the grace of god which was with me therefore whether it were i or they so we preach and so yebelieved now if christ be preached that he rose from the dead how saysome among you that there is no resurrection of the dead   butif there be no resurrection of the dead then is christ not risen and if christ be not risen then is our preaching vain and yourfaith is also vain yea and we are found false witnesses of god because we havetestified of god that he raised up christ whom he raised not up ifso be that the dead rise not for if the dead rise not then is not christ raised  andif christ be not raised your faith is vain ye are yet in your sins then they also which are fallen asleep in christ are perished if in this life only we have hope in christ we are of all menmost miserable but now is christ risen from the dead and become thefirstfruits of them that slept for since by man came death by man came also the resurrectionof the dead for as in adam all die even so in christ shall all be madealive but every man in his own order christ the firstfruitsafterward they that are christs at his coming then cometh the end when he shall have delivered up the kingdomto god even the father when he shall have put down all rule and allauthority and power for he must reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death for he hath put all things under his feet but when he saith allthings are put under him it is manifest that he is excepted whichdid put all things under him and when all things shall be subdued unto him then shall theson also himself be subject unto him that put all things under himthat god may be all in all else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead if thedead rise not at all why are they then baptized for the dead  and why stand we in jeopardy every hour   i protest by yourrejoicing which i have in christ jesus our lord i die daily if after the manner of men i have fought with beasts at ephesuswhat advantageth it me if the dead rise not let us eat and drinkfor to morrow we die be not deceived evil communications corrupt good manners awake to righteousness and sin not for some have not theknowledge of god i speak this to your shame but some man will say how are the dead raised up and with whatbody do they come   thou fool that which thou sowest is notquickened except it die  and that which thou sowest thousowest not that body that shall be but bare grain it may chance ofwheat or of some other grain  but god giveth it a body as ithath pleased him and to every seed his own body all flesh is not the same flesh but there is one kind of fleshof men another flesh of beasts another of fishes and another ofbirds there are also celestial bodies and bodies terrestrial but theglory of the celestial is one and the glory of the terrestrial isanother there is one glory of the sun and another glory of the moonand another glory of the stars for one star differeth from anotherstar in glory so also is the resurrection of the dead it is sown incorruption it is raised in incorruption  it is sown indishonour it is raised in glory it is sown in weakness it is raisedin power  it is sown a natural body it is raised a spiritualbody there is a natural body and there is a spiritual body and so it is written the first man adam was made a living soulthe last adam was made a quickening spirit howbeit that was not first which is spiritual but that which isnatural and afterward that which is spiritual the first man is of the earth earthy the second man is thelord from heaven as is the earthy such are they also that are earthy and as isthe heavenly such are they also that are heavenly and as we have borne the image of the earthy we shall also bearthe image of the heavenly now this i say brethren that flesh and blood cannot inheritthe kingdom of god neither doth corruption inherit incorruption behold i shew you a mystery we shall not all sleep but weshall all be changed  in a moment in the twinkling of an eyeat the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall beraised incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortalmust put on immortality so when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption andthis mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought topass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory o death where is thy sting o grave where is thy victory the sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to god which giveth us the victory through ourlord jesus christ therefore my beloved brethren be ye stedfast unmoveablealways abounding in the work of the lord forasmuch as ye know thatyour labour is not in vain in the lord now concerning the collection for the saints as i have givenorder to the churches of galatia even so do ye upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him instore as god hath prospered him that there be no gatherings when icome and when i come whomsoever ye shall approve by your lettersthem will i send to bring your liberality unto jerusalem and if it be meet that i go also they shall go with me now i will come unto you when i shall pass through macedoniafor i do pass through macedonia and it may be that i will abide yea and winter with you thatye may bring me on my journey whithersoever i go for i will not see you now by the way but i trust to tarry awhile with you if the lord permit but i will tarry at ephesus until pentecost for a great door and effectual is opened unto me and there aremany adversaries now if timotheus come see that he may be with you without fearfor he worketh the work of the lord as i also do let no man therefore despise him but conduct him forth inpeace that he may come unto me for i look for him with the brethren as touching our brother apollos i greatly desired him to comeunto you with the brethren but his will was not at all to come atthis time but he will come when he shall have convenient time watch ye stand fast in the faith quit you like men be strong let all your things be done with charity i beseech you brethren ye know the house of stephanas thatit is the firstfruits of achaia and that they have addictedthemselves to the ministry of the saints  that ye submityourselves unto such and to every one that helpeth with us andlaboureth i am glad of the coming of stephanas and fortunatus andachaicus for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied for they have refreshed my spirit and yours thereforeacknowledge ye them that are such the churches of asia salute you aquila and priscilla salute youmuch in the lord with the church that is in their house all the brethren greet you greet ye one another withan holy kiss the salutation of me paul with mine own hand if any man love not the lord jesus christ let him beanathema maranatha the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you my love be with you all in christ jesus amenthe second epistle of paul the apostle to the corinthians paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god and timothyour brother unto the church of god which is at corinth with all thesaints which are in all achaia  grace be to you and peace from godour father and from the lord jesus christ blessed be god even the father of our lord jesus christ thefather of mercies and the god of all comfort  who comforteth usin all our tribulation that we may be able to comfort them which arein any trouble by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted ofgod for as the sufferings of christ abound in us so our consolationalso aboundeth by christ and whether we be afflicted it is for your consolation andsalvation which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferingswhich we also suffer or whether we be comforted it is for yourconsolation and salvation and our hope of you is stedfast knowing that as ye are partakersof the sufferings so shall ye be also of the consolation for we would not brethren have you ignorant of our trouble whichcame to us in asia that we were pressed out of measure abovestrength insomuch that we despaired even of life  but we had thesentence of death in ourselves that we should not trust in ourselvesbut in god which raiseth the dead  who delivered us from so greata death and doth deliver in whom we trust that he will yet deliverus  ye also helping together by prayer for us that for the giftbestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given bymany on our behalf for our rejoicing is this the testimony of our conscience thatin simplicity and godly sincerity not with fleshly wisdom but by thegrace of god we have had our conversation in the world and moreabundantly to youward for we write none other things unto you than what ye read oracknowledge and i trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end  asalso ye have acknowledged us in part that we are your rejoicing evenas ye also are ours in the day of the lord jesus and in this confidence i was minded to come unto you before thatye might have a second benefit  and to pass by you intomacedonia and to come again out of macedonia unto you and of you tobe brought on my way toward judaea when i therefore was thus minded did i use lightness or thethings that i purpose do i purpose according to the flesh that withme there should be yea yea and nay nay   but as god is true ourword toward you was not yea and nay for the son of god jesus christ who was preached among you byus even by me and silvanus and timotheus was not yea and nay but inhim was yea for all the promises of god in him are yea and in him amen untothe glory of god by us now he which stablisheth us with you in christ and hath anointedus is god  who hath also sealed us and given the earnest of thespirit in our hearts moreover i call god for a record upon my soul that to spare youi came not as yet unto corinth not for that we have dominion over your faith but are helpers ofyour joy for by faith ye stand but i determined this with myself that i would not come again toyou in heaviness for if i make you sorry who is he then that maketh me glad butthe same which is made sorry by me   and i wrote this same untoyou lest when i came i should have sorrow from them of whom i oughtto rejoice having confidence in you all that my joy is the joy ofyou all for out of much affliction and anguish of heart i wrote unto youwith many tears not that ye should be grieved but that ye might knowthe love which i have more abundantly unto you but if any have caused grief he hath not grieved me but in partthat i may not overcharge you all sufficient to such a man is this punishment which was inflictedof many so that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him and comforthim lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuchsorrow wherefore i beseech you that ye would confirm your love towardhim for to this end also did i write that i might know the proof ofyou whether ye be obedient in all things to whom ye forgive any thing i forgive also for if i forgaveany thing to whom i forgave it for your sakes forgave i it in theperson of christ  lest satan should get an advantage of us forwe are not ignorant of his devices furthermore when i came to troas to preach christs gospel anda door was opened unto me of the lord  i had no rest in myspirit because i found not titus my brother but taking my leave ofthem i went from thence into macedonia now thanks be unto god which always causeth us to triumph inchrist and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in everyplace for we are unto god a sweet savour of christ in them that aresaved and in them that perish  to the one we are the savour ofdeath unto death and to the other the savour of life unto life andwho is sufficient for these things   for we are not as manywhich corrupt the word of god but as of sincerity but as of god inthe sight of god speak we in christ do we begin again to commend ourselves or need we as someothers epistles of commendation to you or letters of commendationfrom you   ye are our epistle written in our hearts known andread of all men  forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be theepistle of christ ministered by us written not with ink but with thespirit of the living god not in tables of stone but in fleshy tablesof the heart and such trust have we through christ to godward  not that weare sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves butour sufficiency is of god  who also hath made us able ministers ofthe new testament not of the letter but of the spirit for theletter killeth but the spirit giveth life but if the ministration of death written and engraven in stoneswas glorious so that the children of israel could not stedfastlybehold the face of moses for the glory of his countenance which glorywas to be done away  how shall not the ministration of the spiritbe rather glorious   for if the ministration of condemnation beglory much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed inglory for even that which was made glorious had no glory in thisrespect by reason of the glory that excelleth for if that which is done away was glorious much more that whichremaineth is glorious seeing then that we have such hope we use great plainness ofspeech  and not as moses which put a vail over his face thatthe children of israel could not stedfastly look to the end of thatwhich is abolished  but their minds were blinded for until thisday remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the oldtestament which vail is done away in christ but even unto this day when moses is read the vail is upontheir heart nevertheless when it shall turn to the lord the vail shall betaken away now the lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the lord isthere is liberty but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory ofthe lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even asby the spirit of the lord therefore seeing we have this ministry as we have received mercywe faint not  but have renounced the hidden things of dishonestynot walking in craftiness nor handling the word of god deceitfullybut by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every mansconscience in the sight of god but if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost  inwhom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them whichbelieve not lest the light of the glorious gospel of christ who isthe image of god should shine unto them for we preach not ourselves but christ jesus the lord andourselves your servants for jesus sake for god who commanded the light to shine out of darkness hathshined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the gloryof god in the face of jesus christ but we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellencyof the power may be of god and not of us we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we areperplexed but not in despair  persecuted but not forsaken castdown but not destroyed  always bearing about in the body thedying of the lord jesus that the life also of jesus might be mademanifest in our body for we which live are alway delivered unto death for jesus sakethat the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our mortalflesh so then death worketh in us but life in you we having the same spirit of faith according as it is written ibelieved and therefore have i spoken we also believe and thereforespeak  knowing that he which raised up the lord jesus shall raiseup us also by jesus and shall present us with you for all things are for your sakes that the abundant grace mightthrough the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of god for which cause we faint not but though our outward man perishyet the inward man is renewed day by day for our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh forus a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory  while welook not at the things which are seen but at the things which are notseen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things whichare not seen are eternal for we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle weredissolved we have a building of god an house not made with handseternal in the heavens for in this we groan earnestly desiring to be clothed upon withour house which is from heaven  if so be that being clothed weshall not be found naked for we that are in this tabernacle do groan being burdened notfor that we would be unclothed but clothed upon that mortality mightbe swallowed up of life now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is god whoalso hath given unto us the earnest of the spirit therefore we are always confident knowing that whilst we are athome in the body we are absent from the lord  for we walk byfaith not by sight  we are confident i say and willing ratherto be absent from the body and to be present with the lord wherefore we labour that whether present or absent we may beaccepted of him for we must all appear before the judgment seat of christ thatevery one may receive the things done in his body according to thathe hath done whether it be good or bad knowing therefore the terror of the lord we persuade men but weare made manifest unto god and i trust also are made manifest in yourconsciences for we commend not ourselves again unto you but give youoccasion to glory on our behalf that ye may have somewhat to answerthem which glory in appearance and not in heart for whether we be beside ourselves it is to god or whether webe sober it is for your cause for the love of christ constraineth us because we thus judgethat if one died for all then were all dead  and that he diedfor all that they which live should not henceforth live untothemselves but unto him which died for them and rose again wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh yea thoughwe have known christ after the flesh yet now henceforth know we himno more therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature oldthings are passed away behold all things are become new and all things are of god who hath reconciled us to himself byjesus christ and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation to wit that god was in christ reconciling the world untohimself not imputing their trespasses unto them and hath committedunto us the word of reconciliation now then we are ambassadors for christ as though god did beseechyou by us we pray you in christs stead be ye reconciled to god for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that wemight be made the righteousness of god in him we then as workers together with him beseech you also that yereceive not the grace of god in vain for he saith i have heard thee in a time accepted and in theday of salvation have i succoured thee behold now is the acceptedtime behold now is the day of salvation   giving no offence inany thing that the ministry be not blamed  but in all thingsapproving ourselves as the ministers of god in much patience inafflictions in necessities in distresses  in stripes inimprisonments in tumults in labours in watchings in fastings by pureness by knowledge by longsuffering by kindness by the holyghost by love unfeigned  by the word of truth by the power ofgod by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left by honour and dishonour by evil report and good report asdeceivers and yet true  as unknown and yet well known as dyingand behold we live as chastened and not killed  as sorrowfulyet alway rejoicing as poor yet making many rich as having nothingand yet possessing all things o ye corinthians our mouth is open unto you our heart isenlarged ye are not straitened in us but ye are straitened in your ownbowels now for a recompence in the same i speak as unto my childrenbe ye also enlarged be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers for whatfellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness and what communionhath light with darkness   and what concord hath christ withbelial or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel   andwhat agreement hath the temple of god with idols for ye are thetemple of the living god as god hath said i will dwell in them andwalk in them and i will be their god and they shall be my people wherefore come out from among them and be ye separate saith thelord and touch not the unclean thing and i will receive you and will be a father unto you and ye shall be my sons anddaughters saith the lord almighty having therefore these promises dearly beloved let us cleanseourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit perfectingholiness in the fear of god receive us we have wronged no man we have corrupted no man wehave defrauded no man i speak not this to condemn you for i have said before that yeare in our hearts to die and live with you great is my boldness of speech toward you great is my glorying ofyou i am filled with comfort i am exceeding joyful in all ourtribulation for when we were come into macedonia our flesh had no rest butwe were troubled on every side without were fightings within werefears nevertheless god that comforteth those that are cast downcomforted us by the coming of titus  and not by his coming onlybut by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you when he toldus your earnest desire your mourning your fervent mind toward me sothat i rejoiced the more for though i made you sorry with a letter i do not repent thoughi did repent for i perceive that the same epistle hath made yousorry though it were but for a season now i rejoice not that ye were made sorry but that ye sorrowedto repentance for ye were made sorry after a godly manner that yemight receive damage by us in nothing for godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to berepented of but the sorrow of the world worketh death for behold this selfsame thing that ye sorrowed after a godlysort what carefulness it wrought in you yea what clearing ofyourselves yea what indignation yea what fear yea what vehementdesire yea what zeal yea what revenge in all things ye haveapproved yourselves to be clear in this matter wherefore though i wrote unto you i did it not for his causethat had done the wrong nor for his cause that suffered wrong butthat our care for you in the sight of god might appear unto you therefore we were comforted in your comfort yea and exceedinglythe more joyed we for the joy of titus because his spirit wasrefreshed by you all for if i have boasted any thing to him of you i am not ashamedbut as we spake all things to you in truth even so our boastingwhich i made before titus is found a truth and his inward affection is more abundant toward you whilst heremembereth the obedience of you all how with fear and trembling yereceived him i rejoice therefore that i have confidence in you in all things moreover brethren we do you to wit of the grace of god bestowedon the churches of macedonia  how that in a great trial ofaffliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty aboundedunto the riches of their liberality for to their power i bear record yea and beyond their powerthey were willing of themselves  praying us with much intreatythat we would receive the gift and take upon us the fellowship of theministering to the saints and this they did not as we hoped but first gave their ownselves to the lord and unto us by the will of god insomuch that we desired titus that as he had begun so he wouldalso finish in you the same grace also therefore as ye abound in every thing in faith and utteranceand knowledge and in all diligence and in your love to us see thatye abound in this grace also i speak not by commandment but by occasion of the forwardness ofothers and to prove the sincerity of your love for ye know the grace of our lord jesus christ that though hewas rich yet for your sakes he became poor that ye through hispoverty might be rich and herein i give my advice for this is expedient for you whohave begun before not only to do but also to be forward a year ago now therefore perform the doing of it that as there was areadiness to will so there may be a performance also out of thatwhich ye have for if there be first a willing mind it is accepted according tothat a man hath and not according to that he hath not for i mean not that other men be eased and ye burdened  butby an equality that now at this time your abundance may be a supplyfor their want that their abundance also may be a supply for yourwant that there may be equality  as it is written he that hadgathered much had nothing over and he that had gathered little had nolack but thanks be to god which put the same earnest care into theheart of titus for you for indeed he accepted the exhortation but being more forwardof his own accord he went unto you and we have sent with him the brother whose praise is in thegospel throughout all the churches  and not that only but whowas also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this gracewhich is administered by us to the glory of the same lord anddeclaration of your ready mind  avoiding this that no man shouldblame us in this abundance which is administered by us  providingfor honest things not only in the sight of the lord but also in thesight of men and we have sent with them our brother whom we have oftentimesproved diligent in many things but now much more diligent upon thegreat confidence which i have in you whether any do enquire of titus he is my partner andfellowhelper concerning you or our brethren be enquired of they arethe messengers of the churches and the glory of christ wherefore shew ye to them and before the churches the proof ofyour love and of our boasting on your behalf for as touching the ministering to the saints it is superfluousfor me to write to you  for i know the forwardness of your mindfor which i boast of you to them of macedonia that achaia was ready ayear ago and your zeal hath provoked very many yet have i sent the brethren lest our boasting of you should bein vain in this behalf that as i said ye may be ready  lesthaply if they of macedonia come with me and find you unprepared wethat we say not ye should be ashamed in this same confidentboasting therefore i thought it necessary to exhort the brethren that theywould go before unto you and make up beforehand your bounty whereofye had notice before that the same might be ready as a matter ofbounty and not as of covetousness but this i say he which soweth sparingly shall reap alsosparingly and he which soweth bountifully shall reap alsobountifully every man according as he purposeth in his heart so let him givenot grudgingly or of necessity for god loveth a cheerful giver and god is able to make all grace abound toward you that yealways having all sufficiency in all things may abound to every goodwork  as it is written he hath dispersed abroad he hath givento the poor his righteousness remaineth for ever now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread foryour food and multiply your seed sown and increase the fruits ofyour righteousness  being enriched in every thing to allbountifulness which causeth through us thanksgiving to god for the administration of this service not only supplieth thewant of the saints but is abundant also by many thanksgivings untogod  whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorifygod for your professed subjection unto the gospel of christ and foryour liberal distribution unto them and unto all men  and bytheir prayer for you which long after you for the exceeding grace ofgod in you thanks be unto god for his unspeakable gift now i paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness ofchrist who in presence am base among you but being absent am boldtoward you  but i beseech you that i may not be bold when i ampresent with that confidence wherewith i think to be bold againstsome which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mightythrough god to the pulling down of strong holds  casting downimaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against theknowledge of god and bringing into captivity every thought to theobedience of christ  and having in a readiness to revenge alldisobedience when your obedience is fulfilled do ye look on things after the outward appearance if any mantrust to himself that he is christs let him of himself think thisagain that as he is christs even so are we christs for though i should boast somewhat more of our authority whichthe lord hath given us for edification and not for your destructioni should not be ashamed  that i may not seem as if i wouldterrify you by letters for his letters say they are weighty and powerful but hisbodily presence is weak and his speech contemptible let such an one think this that such as we are in word byletters when we are absent such will we be also in deed when we arepresent for we dare not make ourselves of the number or compareourselves with some that commend themselves but they measuringthemselves by themselves and comparing themselves among themselvesare not wise but we will not boast of things without our measure butaccording to the measure of the rule which god hath distributed to usa measure to reach even unto you for we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure as though wereached not unto you for we are come as far as to you also inpreaching the gospel of christ  not boasting of things withoutour measure that is of other mens labours but having hope whenyour faith is increased that we shall be enlarged by you according toour rule abundantly  to preach the gospel in the regions beyondyou and not to boast in another mans line of things made ready toour hand but he that glorieth let him glory in the lord for not he that commendeth himself is approved but whom thelord commendeth would to god ye could bear with me a little in my folly andindeed bear with me for i am jealous over you with godly jealousy for i haveespoused you to one husband that i may present you as a chaste virginto christ but i fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled evethrough his subtilty so your minds should be corrupted from thesimplicity that is in christ for if he that cometh preacheth another jesus whom we have notpreached or if ye receive another spirit which ye have not receivedor another gospel which ye have not accepted ye might well bear withhim for i suppose i was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles but though i be rude in speech yet not in knowledge but we havebeen throughly made manifest among you in all things have i committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might beexalted because i have preached to you the gospel of god freely i robbed other churches taking wages of them to do you service and when i was present with you and wanted i was chargeable tono man for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came frommacedonia supplied and in all things i have kept myself from beingburdensome unto you and so will i keep myself as the truth of christ is in me no man shall stop me of thisboasting in the regions of achaia wherefore because i love you not god knoweth but what i do that i will do that i may cut off occasion fromthem which desire occasion that wherein they glory they may be foundeven as we for such are false apostles deceitful workers transformingthemselves into the apostles of christ and no marvel for satan himself is transformed into an angel oflight therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also betransformed as the ministers of righteousness whose end shall beaccording to their works i say again let no man think me a fool if otherwise yet as afool receive me that i may boast myself a little that which i speak i speak it not after the lord but as itwere foolishly in this confidence of boasting seeing that many glory after the flesh i will glory also for ye suffer fools gladly seeing ye yourselves are wise for ye suffer if a man bring you into bondage if a man devouryou if a man take of you if a man exalt himself if a man smite youon the face i speak as concerning reproach as though we had been weakhowbeit whereinsoever any is bold i speak foolishly i am boldalso are they hebrews so am i are they israelites so am i arethey the seed of abraham so am i are they ministers of christ i speak as a fool i am more inlabours more abundant in stripes above measure in prisons morefrequent in deaths oft of the jews five times received i forty stripes save one thrice was i beaten with rods once was i stoned thrice isuffered shipwreck a night and a day i have been in the deep in journeyings often in perils of waters in perils of robbers inperils by mine own countrymen in perils by the heathen in perils inthe city in perils in the wilderness in perils in the sea in perilsamong false brethren  in weariness and painfulness in watchingsoften in hunger and thirst in fastings often in cold and nakedness beside those things that are without that which cometh upon medaily the care of all the churches who is weak and i am not weak who is offended and i burn not if i must needs glory i will glory of the things which concernmine infirmities the god and father of our lord jesus christ which is blessedfor evermore knoweth that i lie not in damascus the governor under aretas the king kept the city ofthe damascenes with a garrison desirous to apprehend me  andthrough a window in a basket was i let down by the wall and escapedhis hands it is not expedient for me doubtless to glory i will come tovisions and revelations of the lord i knew a man in christ above fourteen years ago whether in thebody i cannot tell or whether out of the body i cannot tell godknoweth such an one caught up to the third heaven and i knew such a man whether in the body or out of the bodyi cannot tell god knoweth  how that he was caught up intoparadise and heard unspeakable words which it is not lawful for aman to utter of such an one will i glory yet of myself i will not glory butin mine infirmities for though i would desire to glory i shall not be a fool for iwill say the truth but now i forbear lest any man should think of meabove that which he seeth me to be or that he heareth of me and lest i should be exalted above measure through the abundanceof the revelations there was given to me a thorn in the flesh themessenger of satan to buffet me lest i should be exalted abovemeasure for this thing i besought the lord thrice that it might departfrom me and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for mystrength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will irather glory in my infirmities that the power of christ may rest uponme therefore i take pleasure in infirmities in reproaches innecessities in persecutions in distresses for christs sake forwhen i am weak then am i strong i am become a fool in glorying ye have compelled me for iought to have been commended of you for in nothing am i behind thevery chiefest apostles though i be nothing truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in allpatience in signs and wonders and mighty deeds for what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churchesexcept it be that i myself was not burdensome to you forgive me thiswrong behold the third time i am ready to come to you and i will notbe burdensome to you for i seek not yours but you for the childrenought not to lay up for the parents but the parents for the children and i will very gladly spend and be spent for you though themore abundantly i love you the less i be loved but be it so i did not burden you nevertheless being craftyi caught you with guile did i make a gain of you by any of them whom i sent unto you i desired titus and with him i sent a brother did titus make again of you walked we not in the same spirit walked we not in thesame steps   again think ye that we excuse ourselves unto youwe speak before god in christ but we do all things dearly belovedfor your edifying for i fear lest when i come i shall not find you such as iwould and that i shall be found unto you such as ye would not lestthere be debates envyings wraths strifes backbitings whisperingsswellings tumults  and lest when i come again my god willhumble me among you and that i shall bewail many which have sinnedalready and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication andlasciviousness which they have committed this is the third time i am coming to you in the mouth of two orthree witnesses shall every word be established i told you before and foretell you as if i were present thesecond time and being absent now i write to them which heretoforehave sinned and to all other that if i come again i will notspare  since ye seek a proof of christ speaking in me which toyouward is not weak but is mighty in you for though he was crucified through weakness yet he liveth bythe power of god for we also are weak in him but we shall live withhim by the power of god toward you examine yourselves whether ye be in the faith prove your ownselves know ye not your own selves how that jesus christ is in youexcept ye be reprobates   but i trust that ye shall know that weare not reprobates now i pray to god that ye do no evil not that we should appearapproved but that ye should do that which is honest though we be asreprobates for we can do nothing against the truth but for the truth for we are glad when we are weak and ye are strong and thisalso we wish even your perfection therefore i write these things being absent lest being presenti should use sharpness according to the power which the lord hathgiven me to edification and not to destruction finally brethren farewell be perfect be of good comfort beof one mind live in peace and the god of love and peace shall bewith you greet one another with an holy kiss all the saints salute you the grace of the lord jesus christ and the love of god and thecommunion of the holy ghost be with you all amenthe epistle of paul the apostle to the galatians paul an apostle not of men neither by man but by jesuschrist and god the father who raised him from the dead  and allthe brethren which are with me unto the churches of galatia grace be to you and peace from god the father and from our lord jesuschrist  who gave himself for our sins that he might deliver usfrom this present evil world according to the will of god and ourfather  to whom be glory for ever and ever amen i marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you intothe grace of christ unto another gospel  which is not another butthere be some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel ofchrist but though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospelunto you than that which we have preached unto you let him beaccursed as we said before so say i now again if any man preach any othergospel unto you than that ye have received let him be accursed for do i now persuade men or god or do i seek to please menfor if i yet pleased men i should not be the servant of christ but i certify you brethren that the gospel which was preachedof me is not after man for i neither received it of man neither was i taught it but bythe revelation of jesus christ for ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the jewsreligion how that beyond measure i persecuted the church of god andwasted it  and profited in the jews religion above many myequals in mine own nation being more exceedingly zealous of thetraditions of my fathers but when it pleased god who separated me from my mothers womband called me by his grace  to reveal his son in me that i mightpreach him among the heathen immediately i conferred not with fleshand blood  neither went i up to jerusalem to them which wereapostles before me but i went into arabia and returned again untodamascus then after three years i went up to jerusalem to see peter andabode with him fifteen days but other of the apostles saw i none save james the lordsbrother now the things which i write unto you behold before god i lienot afterwards i came into the regions of syria and cilicia  andwas unknown by face unto the churches of judaea which were in christ but they had heard only that he which persecuted us in timespast now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed and they glorified god in me then fourteen years after i went up again to jerusalem withbarnabas and took titus with me also and i went up by revelation and communicated unto them thatgospel which i preach among the gentiles but privately to them whichwere of reputation lest by any means i should run or had run invain but neither titus who was with me being a greek was compelledto be circumcised  and that because of false brethren unawaresbrought in who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we havein christ jesus that they might bring us into bondage  to whom wegave place by subjection no not for an hour that the truth of thegospel might continue with you but of these who seemed to be somewhat whatsoever they were itmaketh no matter to me god accepteth no mans person for they whoseemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me  butcontrariwise when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision wascommitted unto me as the gospel of the circumcision was unto peter for he that wrought effectually in peter to the apostleship ofthe circumcision the same was mighty in me toward the gentiles and when james cephas and john who seemed to be pillars perceivedthe grace that was given unto me they gave to me and barnabas theright hands of fellowship that we should go unto the heathen andthey unto the circumcision only they would that we should remember the poor the same whichi also was forward to do but when peter was come to antioch i withstood him to the facebecause he was to be blamed for before that certain came from james he did eat with thegentiles but when they were come he withdrew and separated himselffearing them which were of the circumcision and the other jews dissembled likewise with him insomuch thatbarnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation but when i saw that they walked not uprightly according to thetruth of the gospel i said unto peter before them all if thou beinga jew livest after the manner of gentiles and not as do the jewswhy compellest thou the gentiles to live as do the jews   we whoare jews by nature and not sinners of the gentiles  knowing thata man is not justified by the works of the law but by the faith ofjesus christ even we have believed in jesus christ that we might bejustified by the faith of christ and not by the works of the law forby the works of the law shall no flesh be justified but if while we seek to be justified by christ we ourselvesalso are found sinners is therefore christ the minister of sin godforbid for if i build again the things which i destroyed i make myselfa transgressor for i through the law am dead to the law that i might live untogod i am crucified with christ neverthless i live yet not i butchrist liveth in me and the life which i now live in the flesh i liveby the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me i do not frustrate the grace of god for if righteousness come bythe law then christ is dead in vain o foolish galatians who hath bewitched you that ye should notobey the truth before whose eyes jesus christ hath been evidently setforth crucified among you   this only would i learn of youreceived ye the spirit by the works of the law or by the hearing offaith   are ye so foolish having begun in the spirit are ye nowmade perfect by the flesh   have ye suffered so many things invain if it be yet in vain he therefore that ministereth to you the spirit and workethmiracles among you doeth he it by the works of the law or by thehearing of faith   even as abraham believed god and it wasaccounted to him for righteousness know ye therefore that they which are of faith the same are thechildren of abraham and the scripture foreseeing that god would justify the heathenthrough faith preached before the gospel unto abraham saying inthee shall all nations be blessed so then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful abraham for as many as are of the works of the law are under the cursefor it is written cursed is every one that continueth not in allthings which are written in the book of the law to do them but that no man is justified by the law in the sight of god itis evident for the just shall live by faith and the law is not of faith but the man that doeth them shalllive in them christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law being made acurse for us for it is written cursed is every one that hangeth on atree  that the blessing of abraham might come on the gentilesthrough jesus christ that we might receive the promise of the spiritthrough faith brethren i speak after the manner of men though it be but amans covenant yet if it be confirmed no man disannulleth or addeththereto now to abraham and his seed were the promises made he saith notand to seeds as of many but as of one and to thy seed which ischrist and this i say that the covenant that was confirmed before ofgod in christ the law which was four hundred and thirty years aftercannot disannul that it should make the promise of none effect for if the inheritance be of the law it is no more of promisebut god gave it to abraham by promise wherefore then serveth the law it was added because oftransgressions till the seed should come to whom the promise wasmade and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator now a mediator is not a mediator of one but god is one is the law then against the promises of god god forbid for ifthere had been a law given which could have given life verilyrighteousness should have been by the law but the scripture hath concluded all under sin that the promiseby faith of jesus christ might be given to them that believe but before faith came we were kept under the law shut up untothe faith which should afterwards be revealed wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto christthat we might be justified by faith but after that faith is come we are no longer under aschoolmaster for ye are all the children of god by faith in christ jesus for as many of you as have been baptized into christ have put onchrist there is neither jew nor greek there is neither bond nor freethere is neither male nor female for ye are all one in christ jesus and if ye be christs then are ye abrahams seed and heirsaccording to the promise now i say that the heir as long as he is a child differethnothing from a servant though he be lord of all  but is undertutors and governors until the time appointed of the father even so we when we were children were in bondage under theelements of the world  but when the fulness of the time was comegod sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law  toredeem them that were under the law that we might receive theadoption of sons and because ye are sons god hath sent forth the spirit of his soninto your hearts crying abba father wherefore thou art no more a servant but a son and if a sonthen an heir of god through christ howbeit then when ye knew not god ye did service unto them whichby nature are no gods but now after that ye have known god or rather are known of godhow turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements whereunto yedesire again to be in bondage   ye observe days and months andtimes and years i am afraid of you lest i have bestowed upon you labour in vain brethren i beseech you be as i am for i am as ye are ye havenot injured me at all ye know how through infirmity of the flesh i preached the gospelunto you at the first and my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not norrejected but received me as an angel of god even as christ jesus where is then the blessedness ye spake of for i bear you recordthat if it had been possible ye would have plucked out your owneyes and have given them to me am i therefore become your enemy because i tell you the truth they zealously affect you but not well yea they would excludeyou that ye might affect them but it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thingand not only when i am present with you my little children of whom i travail in birth again until christbe formed in you  i desire to be present with you now and tochange my voice for i stand in doubt of you tell me ye that desire to be under the law do ye not hear thelaw   for it is written that abraham had two sons the one by abondmaid the other by a freewoman but he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh but heof the freewoman was by promise which things are an allegory for these are the two covenantsthe one from the mount sinai which gendereth to bondage which isagar for this agar is mount sinai in arabia and answereth tojerusalem which now is and is in bondage with her children but jerusalem which is above is free which is the mother of usall for it is written rejoice thou barren that bearest not breakforth and cry thou that travailest not for the desolate hath manymore children than she which hath an husband now we brethren as isaac was are the children of promise but as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him thatwas born after the spirit even so it is now nevertheless what saith the scripture cast out the bondwoman andher son for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the sonof the freewoman so then brethren we are not children of the bondwoman but ofthe free stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith christ hath made usfree and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage behold i paul say unto you that if ye be circumcised christshall profit you nothing for i testify again to every man that is circumcised that he is adebtor to do the whole law christ is become of no effect unto you whosoever of you arejustified by the law ye are fallen from grace for we through the spirit wait for the hope of righteousness byfaith for in jesus christ neither circumcision availeth any thing noruncircumcision but faith which worketh by love ye did run well who did hinder you that ye should not obey thetruth   this persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump i have confidence in you through the lord that ye will be noneotherwise minded but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgmentwhosoever he be and i brethren if i yet preach circumcision why do i yetsuffer persecution then is the offence of the cross ceased i would they were even cut off which trouble you for brethren ye have been called unto liberty only use notliberty for an occasion to the flesh but by love serve one another for all the law is fulfilled in one word even in this thoushalt love thy neighbour as thyself but if ye bite and devour one another take heed that ye be notconsumed one of another this i say then walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfil thelust of the flesh for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit againstthe flesh and these are contrary the one to the other so that yecannot do the things that ye would but if ye be led of the spirit ye are not under the law now the works of the flesh are manifest which are theseadultery fornication uncleanness lasciviousness  idolatrywitchcraft hatred variance emulations wrath strife seditionsheresies  envyings murders drunkenness revellings and suchlike of the which i tell you before as i have also told you in timepast that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom ofgod but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsufferinggentleness goodness faith  meekness temperance against suchthere is no law and they that are christs have crucified the flesh with theaffections and lusts if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit let us not be desirous of vain glory provoking one anotherenvying one another brethren if a man be overtaken in a fault ye which arespiritual restore such an one in the spirit of meekness consideringthyself lest thou also be tempted bear ye one anothers burdens and so fulfil the law of christ for if a man think himself to be something when he is nothing hedeceiveth himself but let every man prove his own work and then shall he haverejoicing in himself alone and not in another for every man shall bear his own burden let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him thatteacheth in all good things be not deceived god is not mocked for whatsoever a man soweththat shall he also reap for he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reapcorruption but he that soweth to the spirit shall of the spirit reaplife everlasting and let us not be weary in well doing for in due season we shallreap if we faint not as we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all menespecially unto them who are of the household of faith ye see how large a letter i have written unto you with mine ownhand as many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh theyconstrain you to be circumcised only lest they should sufferpersecution for the cross of christ for neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law butdesire to have you circumcised that they may glory in your flesh but god forbid that i should glory save in the cross of our lordjesus christ by whom the world is crucified unto me and i unto theworld for in christ jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing noruncircumcision but a new creature and as many as walk according to this rule peace be on them andmercy and upon the israel of god from henceforth let no man trouble me for i bear in my body themarks of the lord jesus brethren the grace of our lord jesus christ be with your spiritamenthe epistle of paul the apostle to the ephesians paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god to thesaints which are at ephesus and to the faithful in christ jesus grace be to you and peace from god our father and from the lordjesus christ blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who hathblessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of theworld that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesuschrist to himself according to the good pleasure of his will  tothe praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us acceptedin the beloved in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness ofsins according to the riches of his grace  wherein he hathabounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence  having made knownunto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure whichhe hath purposed in himself  that in the dispensation of thefulness of times he might gather together in one all things in christboth which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him  inwhom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinatedaccording to the purpose of him who worketh all things after thecounsel of his own will  that we should be to the praise of hisglory who first trusted in christ in whom ye also trusted after that ye heard the word of truththe gospel of your salvation in whom also after that ye believed yewere sealed with that holy spirit of promise  which is theearnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchasedpossession unto the praise of his glory wherefore i also after i heard of your faith in the lord jesusand love unto all the saints  cease not to give thanks for youmaking mention of you in my prayers  that the god of our lordjesus christ the father of glory may give unto you the spirit ofwisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him  the eyes of yourunderstanding being enlightened that ye may know what is the hope ofhis calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance inthe saints  and what is the exceeding greatness of his power tousward who believe according to the working of his mighty power which he wrought in christ when he raised him from the dead andset him at his own right hand in the heavenly places  far aboveall principality and power and might and dominion and every namethat is named not only in this world but also in that which is tocome  and hath put all things under his feet and gave him to bethe head over all things to the church  which is his body thefulness of him that filleth all in all and you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of thisworld according to the prince of the power of the air the spiritthat now worketh in the children of disobedience  among whom alsowe all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our fleshfulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and were bynature the children of wrath even as others but god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith heloved us  even when we were dead in sins hath quickened ustogether with christ by grace ye are saved  and hath raised usup together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christjesus  that in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding richesof his grace in his kindness toward us through christ jesus for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not ofyourselves it is the gift of god  not of works lest any manshould boast for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus unto goodworks which god hath before ordained that we should walk in them wherefore remember that ye being in time past gentiles in theflesh who are called uncircumcision by that which is called thecircumcision in the flesh made by hands  that at that time yewere without christ being aliens from the commonwealth of israel andstrangers from the covenants of promise having no hope and withoutgod in the world  but now in christ jesus ye who sometimes werefar off are made nigh by the blood of christ for he is our peace who hath made both one and hath broken downthe middle wall of partition between us  having abolished in hisflesh the enmity even the law of commandments contained inordinances for to make in himself of twain one new man so makingpeace  and that he might reconcile both unto god in one body bythe cross having slain the enmity thereby  and came and preachedpeace to you which were afar off and to them that were nigh for through him we both have access by one spirit unto thefather now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners butfellowcitizens with the saints and of the household of god  andare built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets jesuschrist himself being the chief corner stone  in whom all thebuilding fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in thelord  in whom ye also are builded together for an habitation ofgod through the spirit for this cause i paul the prisoner of jesus christ for yougentiles  if ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of godwhich is given me to youward  how that by revelation he madeknown unto me the mystery as i wrote afore in few words whereby when ye read ye may understand my knowledge in the mysteryof christ  which in other ages was not made known unto the sons ofmen as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by thespirit  that the gentiles should be fellowheirs and of the samebody and partakers of his promise in christ by the gospel whereof i was made a minister according to the gift of the grace ofgod given unto me by the effectual working of his power unto me who am less than the least of all saints is this gracegiven that i should preach among the gentiles the unsearchable richesof christ  and to make all men see what is the fellowship of themystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in godwho created all things by jesus christ  to the intent that nowunto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be knownby the church the manifold wisdom of god  according to theeternal purpose which he purposed in christ jesus our lord  inwhom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him wherefore i desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for youwhich is your glory for this cause i bow my knees unto the father of our lord jesuschrist  of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory tobe strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man  thatchrist may dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted andgrounded in love  may be able to comprehend with all saints whatis the breadth and length and depth and height  and to knowthe love of christ which passeth knowledge that ye might be filledwith all the fulness of god now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above allthat we ask or think according to the power that worketh in us unto him be glory in the church by christ jesus throughout all agesworld without end amen i therefore the prisoner of the lord beseech you that ye walkworthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called  with all lowlinessand meekness with longsuffering forbearing one another in love endeavouring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace there is one body and one spirit even as ye are called in onehope of your calling  one lord one faith one baptism  onegod and father of all who is above all and through all and in youall but unto every one of us is given grace according to the measureof the gift of christ wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivitycaptive and gave gifts unto men now that he ascended what is it but that he also descended firstinto the lower parts of the earth   he that descended is the samealso that ascended up far above all heavens that he might fill allthings   and he gave some apostles and some prophets andsome evangelists and some pastors and teachers  for theperfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for theedifying of the body of christ  till we all come in the unity ofthe faith and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect manunto the measure of the stature of the fulness of christ  that wehenceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried aboutwith every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men and cunningcraftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive  but speaking thetruth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the headeven christ  from whom the whole body fitly joined together andcompacted by that which every joint supplieth according to theeffectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of thebody unto the edifying of itself in love this i say therefore and testify in the lord that ye henceforthwalk not as other gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind having the understanding darkened being alienated from the life ofgod through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness oftheir heart  who being past feeling have given themselves overunto lasciviousness to work all uncleanness with greediness but ye have not so learned christ  if so be that ye haveheard him and have been taught by him as the truth is in jesus that ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man whichis corrupt according to the deceitful lusts  and be renewed inthe spirit of your mind  and that ye put on the new man whichafter god is created in righteousness and true holiness wherefore putting away lying speak every man truth with hisneighbour for we are members one of another be ye angry and sin not let not the sun go down upon yourwrath  neither give place to the devil let him that stole steal no more but rather let him labourworking with his hands the thing which is good that he may have togive to him that needeth let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but thatwhich is good to the use of edifying that it may minister grace untothe hearers and grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby ye are sealed untothe day of redemption let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamour and evilspeaking be put away from you with all malice  and be ye kindone to another tenderhearted forgiving one another even as god forchrists sake hath forgiven you be ye therefore followers of god as dear children  and walkin love as christ also hath loved us and hath given himself for usan offering and a sacrifice to god for a sweetsmelling savour but fornication and all uncleanness or covetousness let it notbe once named among you as becometh saints  neither filthinessnor foolish talking nor jesting which are not convenient but rathergiving of thanks for this ye know that no whoremonger nor unclean person norcovetous man who is an idolater hath any inheritance in the kingdomof christ and of god let no man deceive you with vain words for because of thesethings cometh the wrath of god upon the children of disobedience be not ye therefore partakers with them for ye were sometimes darkness but now are ye light in the lordwalk as children of light  for the fruit of the spirit is in allgoodness and righteousness and truth  proving what is acceptableunto the lord and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness butrather reprove them for it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done ofthem in secret but all things that are reproved are made manifest by the lightfor whatsoever doth make manifest is light wherefore he saith awake thou that sleepest and arise from thedead and christ shall give thee light see then that ye walk circumspectly not as fools but as wise redeeming the time because the days are evil wherefore be ye not unwise but understanding what the will ofthe lord is and be not drunk with wine wherein is excess but be filled withthe spirit  speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns andspiritual songs singing and making melody in your heart to the lord giving thanks always for all things unto god and the father inthe name of our lord jesus christ  submitting yourselves one toanother in the fear of god wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto thelord for the husband is the head of the wife even as christ is thehead of the church and he is the saviour of the body therefore as the church is subject unto christ so let the wivesbe to their own husbands in every thing husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the churchand gave himself for it  that he might sanctify and cleanse itwith the washing of water by the word  that he might present itto himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any suchthing but that it should be holy and without blemish so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies he thatloveth his wife loveth himself for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourisheth andcherisheth it even as the lord the church  for we are members ofhis body of his flesh and of his bones for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shallbe joined unto his wife and they two shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but i speak concerning christ and thechurch nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wifeeven as himself and the wife see that she reverence her husband children obey your parents in the lord for this is right honour thy father and mother which is the first commandment withpromise  that it may be well with thee and thou mayest live longon the earth and ye fathers provoke not your children to wrath but bringthem up in the nurture and admonition of the lord servants be obedient to them that are your masters according tothe flesh with fear and trembling in singleness of your heart asunto christ  not with eyeservice as menpleasers but as theservants of christ doing the will of god from the heart  withgood will doing service as to the lord and not to men  knowingthat whatsoever good thing any man doeth the same shall he receive ofthe lord whether he be bond or free and ye masters do the same things unto them forbearingthreatening knowing that your master also is in heaven neither isthere respect of persons with him finally my brethren be strong in the lord and in the power ofhis might put on the whole armour of god that ye may be able to standagainst the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but againstprincipalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness ofthis world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armour of god that ye may beable to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins girt about with truth andhaving on the breastplate of righteousness  and your feet shodwith the preparation of the gospel of peace  above all takingthe shield of faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all thefiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spiritwhich is the word of god  praying always with all prayer andsupplication in the spirit and watching thereunto with allperseverance and supplication for all saints  and for me thatutterance may be given unto me that i may open my mouth boldly tomake known the mystery of the gospel  for which i am anambassador in bonds that therein i may speak boldly as i ought tospeak but that ye also may know my affairs and how i do tychicus abeloved brother and faithful minister in the lord shall make known toyou all things  whom i have sent unto you for the same purposethat ye might know our affairs and that he might comfort your hearts peace be to the brethren and love with faith from god thefather and the lord jesus christ grace be with all them that love our lord jesus christ insincerityamenthe epistle of paul the apostle to the philippians paul and timotheus the servants of jesus christ to all thesaints in christ jesus which are at philippi with the bishops anddeacons  grace be unto you and peace from god our father andfrom the lord jesus christ i thank my god upon every remembrance of you  always in everyprayer of mine for you all making request with joy  for yourfellowship in the gospel from the first day until now  beingconfident of this very thing that he which hath begun a good work inyou will perform it until the day of jesus christ  even as it ismeet for me to think this of you all because i have you in my heartinasmuch as both in my bonds and in the defence and confirmation ofthe gospel ye all are partakers of my grace for god is my record how greatly i long after you all in thebowels of jesus christ and this i pray that your love may abound yet more and more inknowledge and in all judgment  that ye may approve things thatare excellent that ye may be sincere and without offence till the dayof christ being filled with the fruits of righteousness which are by jesuschrist unto the glory and praise of god but i would ye should understand brethren that the things whichhappened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of thegospel  so that my bonds in christ are manifest in all thepalace and in all other places  and many of the brethren in thelord waxing confident by my bonds are much more bold to speak theword without fear some indeed preach christ even of envy and strife and some alsoof good will  the one preach christ of contention not sincerelysupposing to add affliction to my bonds  but the other of loveknowing that i am set for the defence of the gospel what then notwithstanding every way whether in pretence or intruth christ is preached and i therein do rejoice yea and willrejoice for i know that this shall turn to my salvation through yourprayer and the supply of the spirit of jesus christ  accordingto my earnest expectation and my hope that in nothing i shall beashamed but that with all boldness as always so now also christshall be magnified in my body whether it be by life or by death for to me to live is christ and to die is gain but if i live in the flesh this is the fruit of my labour yetwhat i shall choose i wot not for i am in a strait betwixt two having a desire to depart andto be with christ which is far better  nevertheless to abide inthe flesh is more needful for you and having this confidence i know that i shall abide andcontinue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith  thatyour rejoicing may be more abundant in jesus christ for me by mycoming to you again only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel ofchrist that whether i come and see you or else be absent i may hearof your affairs that ye stand fast in one spirit with one mindstriving together for the faith of the gospel  and in nothingterrified by your adversaries which is to them an evident token ofperdition but to you of salvation and that of god for unto you it is given in the behalf of christ not only tobelieve on him but also to suffer for his sake  having the sameconflict which ye saw in me and now hear to be in me if there be therefore any consolation in christ if any comfort oflove if any fellowship of the spirit if any bowels and mercies fulfil ye my joy that ye be likeminded having the same love beingof one accord of one mind let nothing be done through strife or vainglory but in lowlinessof mind let each esteem other better than themselves look not every man on his own things but every man also on thethings of others let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus  whobeing in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of aservant and was made in the likeness of men  and being found infashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto deatheven the death of the cross wherefore god also hath highly exalted him and given him a namewhich is above every name  that at the name of jesus every kneeshould bow of things in heaven and things in earth and things underthe earth  and that every tongue should confess that jesus christis lord to the glory of god the father wherefore my beloved as ye have always obeyed not as in mypresence only but now much more in my absence work out your ownsalvation with fear and trembling for it is god which worketh in you both to will and to do of hisgood pleasure do all things without murmurings and disputings  that ye maybe blameless and harmless the sons of god without rebuke in themidst of a crooked and perverse nation among whom ye shine as lightsin the world  holding forth the word of life that i may rejoicein the day of christ that i have not run in vain neither laboured invain yea and if i be offered upon the sacrifice and service of yourfaith i joy and rejoice with you all for the same cause also do ye joy and rejoice with me but i trust in the lord jesus to send timotheus shortly unto youthat i also may be of good comfort when i know your state for i have no man likeminded who will naturally care for yourstate for all seek their own not the things which are jesus christs but ye know the proof of him that as a son with the father hehath served with me in the gospel him therefore i hope to send presently so soon as i shall seehow it will go with me but i trust in the lord that i also myself shall come shortly yet i supposed it necessary to send to you epaphroditus mybrother and companion in labour and fellowsoldier but yourmessenger and he that ministered to my wants for he longed after you all and was full of heaviness becausethat ye had heard that he had been sick for indeed he was sick nigh unto death but god had mercy on himand not on him only but on me also lest i should have sorrow uponsorrow i sent him therefore the more carefully that when ye see himagain ye may rejoice and that i may be the less sorrowful receive him therefore in the lord with all gladness and holdsuch in reputation  because for the work of christ he was nighunto death not regarding his life to supply your lack of servicetoward me finally my brethren rejoice in the lord to write the samethings to you to me indeed is not grievous but for you it is safe beware of dogs beware of evil workers beware of the concision for we are the circumcision which worship god in the spirit andrejoice in christ jesus and have no confidence in the flesh though i might also have confidence in the flesh if any other manthinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh i more circumcised the eighth day of the stock of israel of the tribe ofbenjamin an hebrew of the hebrews as touching the law a pharisee concerning zeal persecuting the church touching therighteousness which is in the law blameless but what things were gain to me those i counted loss for christ yea doubtless and i count all things but loss for the excellencyof the knowledge of christ jesus my lord for whom i have suffered theloss of all things and do count them but dung that i may win christ and be found in him not having mine own righteousness which isof the law but that which is through the faith of christ therighteousness which is of god by faith  that i may know him andthe power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferingsbeing made conformable unto his death  if by any means i mightattain unto the resurrection of the dead not as though i had already attained either were alreadyperfect but i follow after if that i may apprehend that for whichalso i am apprehended of christ jesus brethren i count not myself to have apprehended but this onething i do forgetting those things which are behind and reachingforth unto those things which are before  i press toward the markfor the prize of the high calling of god in christ jesus let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded and ifin any thing ye be otherwise minded god shall reveal even this untoyou nevertheless whereto we have already attained let us walk bythe same rule let us mind the same thing brethren be followers together of me and mark them which walkso as ye have us for an ensample for many walk of whom i have told you often and now tell youeven weeping that they are the enemies of the cross of christ whose end is destruction whose god is their belly and whose glory isin their shame who mind earthly things   for our conversationis in heaven from whence also we look for the saviour the lord jesuschrist  who shall change our vile body that it may be fashionedlike unto his glorious body according to the working whereby he isable even to subdue all things unto himself therefore my brethren dearly beloved and longed for my joy andcrown so stand fast in the lord my dearly beloved i beseech euodias and beseech syntyche that they be of the samemind in the lord and i intreat thee also true yokefellow help those women whichlaboured with me in the gospel with clement also and with other myfellowlabourers whose names are in the book of life rejoice in the lord alway and again i say rejoice let your moderation be known unto all men the lord is at hand be careful for nothing but in every thing by prayer andsupplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known untogod and the peace of god which passeth all understanding shall keepyour hearts and minds through christ jesus finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever thingsare honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are purewhatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report ifthere be any virtue and if there be any praise think on thesethings those things which ye have both learned and received and heardand seen in me do and the god of peace shall be with you but i rejoiced in the lord greatly that now at the last yourcare of me hath flourished again wherein ye were also careful but yelacked opportunity not that i speak in respect of want for i have learned inwhatsoever state i am therewith to be content i know both how to be abased and i know how to abound everywhere and in all things i am instructed both to be full and to behungry both to abound and to suffer need i can do all things through christ which strengtheneth me notwithstanding ye have well done that ye did communicate withmy affliction now ye philippians know also that in the beginning of thegospel when i departed from macedonia no church communicated with meas concerning giving and receiving but ye only for even in thessalonica ye sent once and again unto mynecessity not because i desire a gift but i desire fruit that may aboundto your account but i have all and abound i am full having received ofepaphroditus the things which were sent from you an odour of a sweetsmell a sacrifice acceptable wellpleasing to god but my god shall supply all your need according to his riches inglory by christ jesus now unto god and our father be glory for ever and ever amen salute every saint in christ jesus the brethren which are withme greet you all the saints salute you chiefly they that are of caesarshousehold the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you all amenthe epistle of paul the apostle to the colossians  paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of godand timotheus our brother   to the saints and faithful brethrenin christ which are at colosse grace be unto you and peacefrom god our father and the lord jesus christ  we give thanks to god and the father of our lord jesus christ prayingalways for you  since we heard of your faith in christ jesus and of the love which yehave to all the saints  for the hope which is laid up for you in heaven whereof ye heardbefore in the word of the truth of the gospel  which is come unto you as it is in all the world and bringeth forthfruit as it doth also in you since the day ye heard of it and knew thegrace of god in truth  as ye also learned of epaphras our dear fellowservant who is for youa faithful minister of christ  who also declared unto us your love in the spirit  for this cause we also since the day we heard it do not cease topray for you and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of hiswill in all wisdom and spiritual understanding  that ye might walk worthy of the lord unto all pleasing beingfruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of god  strengthened with all might according to his glorious power untoall patience and longsuffering with joyfulness  giving thanks unto the father which hath made us meet to bepartakers of the inheritance of the saints in light  who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translatedus into the kingdom of his dear son  in whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness ofsins  who is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of everycreature  for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that arein earth visible and invisible whether they be thrones or dominions orprincipalities or powers all things were created by him and for him  and he is before all things and by him all things consist  and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning thefirstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence  for it pleased the father that in him should all fulness dwell  and having made peace through the blood of his cross by him toreconcile all things unto himself by him i say whether they be things inearth or things in heaven  and you that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind bywicked works yet now hath he reconciled  in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy andunblameable and unreproveable in his sight  if ye continue in the faith grounded and settled and be not movedaway from the hope of the gospel which ye have heard and which was preachedto every creature which is under heaven whereof i paul am made a minister  who now rejoice in my sufferings for you and fill up that which isbehind of the afflictions of christ in my flesh for his bodys sake which isthe church  whereof i am made a minister according to the dispensation of godwhich is given to me for you to fulfil the word of god  even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generationsbut now is made manifest to his saints  to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of thismystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory  whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man in allwisdom that we may present every man perfect in christ jesus  whereunto i also labour striving according to his working whichworketh in me mightily  for i would that ye knew what great conflict i have for you and forthem at laodicea and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh  that their hearts might be comforted being knit together in love andunto all riches of the full assurance of understanding to theacknowledgement of the mystery of god and of the father and of christ  in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge  and this i say lest any man should beguile you with enticing words  for though i be absent in the flesh yet am i with you in the spiritjoying and beholding your order and the stedfastness of your faith inchrist  as ye have therefore received christ jesus the lord so walk ye inhim  rooted and built up in him and stablished in the faith as ye havebeen taught abounding therein with thanksgiving  beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceitafter the tradition of men after the rudiments of the world and not afterchrist  for in him dwelleth all the fulness of the godhead bodily  and ye are complete in him which is the head of all principality andpower  in whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made withouthands in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcisionof christ  buried with him in baptism wherein also ye are risen with himthrough the faith of the operation of god who hath raised him from the dead  and you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of yourflesh hath he quickened together with him having forgiven you alltrespasses  blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us whichwas contrary to us and took it out of the way nailing it to his cross  and having spoiled principalities and powers he made a shew of themopenly triumphing over them in it  let no man therefore judge you in meat or in drink or in respect ofan holyday or of the new moon or of the sabbath days  which are a shadow of things to come but the body is of christ  let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility andworshipping of angels intruding into those things which he hath not seenvainly puffed up by his fleshly mind  and not holding the head from which all the body by joints and bandshaving nourishment ministered and knit together increaseth with theincrease of god  wherefore if ye be dead with christ from the rudiments of the worldwhy as though living in the world are ye subject to ordinances  touch not taste not handle not  which all are to perish with the using after the commandments anddoctrines of men  which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship andhumility and neglecting of the body not in any honour to the satisfyingof the flesh  if ye then be risen with christ seek those things which are abovewhere christ sitteth on the right hand of god  set your affection on things above not on things on the earth  for ye are dead and your life is hid with christ in god  when christ who is our life shall appear then shall ye also appearwith him in glory  mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth fornicationuncleanness inordinate affection evil concupiscence and covetousnesswhich is idolatry  for which things sake the wrath of god cometh on the children ofdisobedience  in the which ye also walked some time when ye lived in them  but now ye also put off all these anger wrath malice blasphemyfilthy communication out of your mouth  lie not one to another seeing that ye have put off the old man withhis deeds  and have put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge after theimage of him that created him  where there is neither greek nor jew circumcision noruncircumcision barbarian scythian bond nor free but christ is all and inall  put on therefore as the elect of god holy and beloved bowels ofmercies kindness humbleness of mind meekness longsuffering  forbearing one another and forgiving one another if any man have aquarrel against any even as christ forgave you so also do ye  and above all these things put on charity which is the bond ofperfectness  and let the peace of god rule in your hearts to the which also yeare called in one body and be ye thankful  let the word of christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom teachingand admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singingwith grace in your hearts to the lord  and whatsoever ye do in word or deed do all in the name of the lordjesus giving thanks to god and the father by him  wives submit

amenthe first epistle of paul the apostle to the thessalonians paul and silvanus and timotheus unto the church of thethessalonians which is in god the father and in the lord jesus christgrace be unto you and peace from god our father and the lord jesuschrist we give thanks to god always for you all making mention of you inour prayers  remembering without ceasing your work of faith andlabour of love and patience of hope in our lord jesus christ in thesight of god and our father  knowing brethren beloved yourelection of god for our gospel came not unto you in word only but also in powerand in the holy ghost and in much assurance as ye know what mannerof men we were among you for your sake and ye became followers of us and of the lord having receivedthe word in much affliction with joy of the holy ghost so that ye were ensamples to all that believe in macedonia andachaia for from you sounded out the word of the lord not only inmacedonia and achaia but also in every place your faith to godwardis spread abroad so that we need not to speak any thing for they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we hadunto you and how ye turned to god from idols to serve the living andtrue god  and to wait for his son from heaven whom he raisedfrom the dead even jesus which delivered us from the wrath to come for yourselves brethren know our entrance in unto you that itwas not in vain  but even after that we had suffered before andwere shamefully entreated as ye know at philippi we were bold inour god to speak unto you the gospel of god with much contention for our exhortation was not of deceit nor of uncleanness nor inguile  but as we were allowed of god to be put in trust with thegospel even so we speak not as pleasing men but god which triethour hearts for neither at any time used we flattering words as ye know nora cloke of covetousness god is witness  nor of men sought weglory neither of you nor yet of others when we might have beenburdensome as the apostles of christ but we were gentle among you even as a nurse cherisheth herchildren  so being affectionately desirous of you we were willingto have imparted unto you not the gospel of god only but also ourown souls because ye were dear unto us for ye remember brethren our labour and travail for labouringnight and day because we would not be chargeable unto any of you wepreached unto you the gospel of god ye are witnesses and god also how holily and justly andunblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe  as yeknow how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you as afather doth his children  that ye would walk worthy of god whohath called you unto his kingdom and glory for this cause also thank we god without ceasing because whenye received the word of god which ye heard of us ye received it notas the word of men but as it is in truth the word of god whicheffectually worketh also in you that believe for ye brethren became followers of the churches of god whichin judaea are in christ jesus for ye also have suffered like thingsof your own countrymen even as they have of the jews  who bothkilled the lord jesus and their own prophets and have persecuted usand they please not god and are contrary to all men  forbiddingus to speak to the gentiles that they might be saved to fill up theirsins alway for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost but we brethren being taken from you for a short time inpresence not in heart endeavoured the more abundantly to see yourface with great desire wherefore we would have come unto you even i paul once andagain but satan hindered us for what is our hope or joy or crown of rejoicing are not evenye in the presence of our lord jesus christ at his coming   forye are our glory and joy wherefore when we could no longer forbear we thought it good tobe left at athens alone  and sent timotheus our brother andminister of god and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of christ toestablish you and to comfort you concerning your faith  that noman should be moved by these afflictions for yourselves know that weare appointed thereunto for verily when we were with you we told you before that weshould suffer tribulation even as it came to pass and ye know for this cause when i could no longer forbear i sent to knowyour faith lest by some means the tempter have tempted you and ourlabour be in vain but now when timotheus came from you unto us and brought us goodtidings of your faith and charity and that ye have good remembranceof us always desiring greatly to see us as we also to see you therefore brethren we were comforted over you in all our afflictionand distress by your faith  for now we live if ye stand fast inthe lord for what thanks can we render to god again for you for all thejoy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our god  night and daypraying exceedingly that we might see your face and might perfectthat which is lacking in your faith   now god himself and ourfather and our lord jesus christ direct our way unto you and the lord make you to increase and abound in love one towardanother and toward all men even as we do toward you  to the endhe may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before god evenour father at the coming of our lord jesus christ with all hissaints furthermore then we beseech you brethren and exhort you by thelord jesus that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and toplease god so ye would abound more and more for ye know what commandments we gave you by the lord jesus for this is the will of god even your sanctification that yeshould abstain from fornication  that every one of you should knowhow to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour  not in thelust of concupiscence even as the gentiles which know not god that no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter becausethat the lord is the avenger of all such as we also have forewarnedyou and testified for god hath not called us unto uncleanness but unto holiness he therefore that despiseth despiseth not man but god who hathalso given unto us his holy spirit but as touching brotherly love ye need not that i write unto youfor ye yourselves are taught of god to love one another and indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in allmacedonia but we beseech you brethren that ye increase more andmore  and that ye study to be quiet and to do your own businessand to work with your own hands as we commanded you  that ye maywalk honestly toward them that are without and that ye may have lackof nothing but i would not have you to be ignorant brethren concerningthem which are asleep that ye sorrow not even as others which haveno hope for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so themalso which sleep in jesus will god bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we whichare alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not preventthem which are asleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout withthe voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead inchrist shall rise first  then we which are alive and remain shallbe caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in theair and so shall we ever be with the lord wherefore comfort one another with these words but of the times and the seasons brethren ye have no need that iwrite unto you for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the lord so comethas a thief in the night for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destructioncometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shallnot escape but ye brethren are not in darkness that that day shouldovertake you as a thief ye are all the children of light and the children of the day weare not of the night nor of darkness therefore let us not sleep as do others but let us watch and besober for they that sleep sleep in the night and they that be drunkenare drunken in the night but let us who are of the day be sober putting on thebreastplate of faith and love and for an helmet the hope ofsalvation for god hath not appointed us to wrath but to obtain salvation byour lord jesus christ  who died for us that whether we wake orsleep we should live together with him wherefore comfort yourselves together and edify one anothereven as also ye do and we beseech you brethren to know them which labour amongyou and are over you in the lord and admonish you  and toesteem them very highly in love for their works sake and be at peaceamong yourselves now we exhort you brethren warn them that are unruly comfortthe feebleminded support the weak be patient toward all men see that none render evil for evil unto any man but ever followthat which is good both among yourselves and to all men rejoice evermore pray without ceasing in every thing give thanks for this is the will of god in christjesus concerning you quench not the spirit despise not prophesyings prove all things hold fast that which is good abstain from all appearance of evil and the very god of peace sanctify you wholly and i pray godyour whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto thecoming of our lord jesus christ faithful is he that calleth you who also will do it brethren pray for us greet all the brethren with an holy kiss i charge you by the lord that this epistle be read unto all theholy brethren the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you amenthe second epistle of paul the apostle to the thessalonians paul and silvanus and timotheus unto the church of thethessalonians in god our father and the lord jesus christ  graceunto you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ we are bound to thank god always for you brethren as it is meetbecause that your faith groweth exceedingly and the charity of everyone of you all toward each other aboundeth  so that we ourselvesglory in you in the churches of god for your patience and faith in allyour persecutions and tribulations that ye endure  which is amanifest token of the righteous judgment of god that ye may becounted worthy of the kingdom of god for which ye also suffer seeing it is a righteous thing with god to recompense tribulation tothem that trouble you  and to you who are troubled rest with uswhen the lord jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mightyangels  in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know notgod and that obey not the gospel of our lord jesus christ  whoshall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence ofthe lord and from the glory of his power  when he shall come tobe glorified in his saints and to be admired in all them that believebecause our testimony among you was believed in that day wherefore also we pray always for you that our god would countyou worthy of this calling and fulfil all the good pleasure of hisgoodness and the work of faith with power  that the name of ourlord jesus christ may be glorified in you and ye in him according tothe grace of our god and the lord jesus christ now we beseech you brethren by the coming of our lord jesuschrist and by our gathering together unto him  that ye be notsoon shaken in mind or be troubled neither by spirit nor by wordnor by letter as from us as that the day of christ is at hand let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not comeexcept there come a falling away first and that man of sin berevealed the son of perdition  who opposeth and exalteth himselfabove all that is called god or that is worshipped so that he as godsitteth in the temple of god shewing himself that he is god remember ye not that when i was yet with you i told you thesethings   and now ye know what withholdeth that he might berevealed in his time for the mystery of iniquity doth already work only he who nowletteth will let until he be taken out of the way and then shall that wicked be revealed whom the lord shallconsume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with thebrightness of his coming  even him whose coming is after theworking of satan with all power and signs and lying wonders  andwith all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perishbecause they received not the love of the truth that they might besaved and for this cause god shall send them strong delusion that theyshould believe a lie  that they all might be damned who believednot the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness but we are bound to give thanks alway to god for you brethrenbeloved of the lord because god hath from the beginning chosen you tosalvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of thetruth  whereunto he called you by our gospel to the obtaining ofthe glory of our lord jesus christ therefore brethren stand fast and hold the traditions which yehave been taught whether by word or our epistle now our lord jesus christ himself and god even our fatherwhich hath loved us and hath given us everlasting consolation andgood hope through grace  comfort your hearts and stablish you inevery good word and work finally brethren pray for us that the word of the lord may havefree course and be glorified even as it is with you  and that wemay be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men for all men havenot faith but the lord is faithful who shall stablish you and keep youfrom evil and we have confidence in the lord touching you that ye both doand will do the things which we command you and the lord direct your hearts into the love of god and into thepatient waiting for christ now we command you brethren in the name of our lord jesuschrist that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walkethdisorderly and not after the tradition which he received of us for yourselves know how ye ought to follow us for we behaved notourselves disorderly among you  neither did we eat any mans breadfor nought but wrought with labour and travail night and day that wemight not be chargeable to any of you  not because we have notpower but to make ourselves an ensample unto you to follow us for even when we were with you this we commanded you that ifany would not work neither should he eat for we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderlyworking not at all but are busybodies now them that are such we command and exhort by our lord jesuschrist that with quietness they work and eat their own bread but ye brethren be not weary in well doing and if any man obey not our word by this epistle note that manand have no company with him that he may be ashamed yet count him not as an enemy but admonish him as a brother now the lord of peace himself give you peace always by all meansthe lord be with you all the salutation of paul with mine own hand which is the token inevery epistle so i write the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you all amenthe first epistle of paul the apostle to timothy paul an apostle of jesus christ by the commandment of god oursaviour and lord jesus christ which is our hope  unto timothymy own son in the faith grace mercy and peace from god our fatherand jesus christ our lord as i besought thee to abide still at ephesus when i went intomacedonia that thou mightest charge some that they teach no otherdoctrine  neither give heed to fables and endless genealogieswhich minister questions rather than godly edifying which is infaith so do now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart andof a good conscience and of faith unfeigned  from which somehaving swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling  desiring tobe teachers of the law understanding neither what they say norwhereof they affirm but we know that the law is good if a man use it lawfully knowing this that the law is not made for a righteous man but forthe lawless and disobedient for the ungodly and for sinners forunholy and profane for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothersfor manslayers  for whoremongers for them that defile themselveswith mankind for menstealers for liars for perjured persons and ifthere be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine according to the glorious gospel of the blessed god which wascommitted to my trust and i thank christ jesus our lord who hath enabled me for thathe counted me faithful putting me into the ministry  who wasbefore a blasphemer and a persecutor and injurious but i obtainedmercy because i did it ignorantly in unbelief and the grace of our lord was exceeding abundant with faith andlove which is in christ jesus this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation thatchrist jesus came into the world to save sinners of whom i am chief howbeit for this cause i obtained mercy that in me first jesuschrist might shew forth all longsuffering for a pattern to them whichshould hereafter believe on him to life everlasting now unto the king eternal immortal invisible the only wisegod be honour and glory for ever and ever amen this charge i commit unto thee son timothy according to theprophecies which went before on thee that thou by them mightest war agood warfare  holding faith and a good conscience which somehaving put away concerning faith have made shipwreck  of whom ishymenaeus and alexander whom i have delivered unto satan that theymay learn not to blaspheme i exhort therefore that first of all supplications prayersintercessions and giving of thanks be made for all men  forkings and for all that are in authority that we may lead a quiet andpeaceable life in all godliness and honesty for this is good and acceptable in the sight of god our saviour who will have all men to be saved and to come unto the knowledgeof the truth for there is one god and one mediator between god and men theman christ jesus  who gave himself a ransom for all to betestified in due time whereunto i am ordained a preacher and an apostle i speak thetruth in christ and lie not a teacher of the gentiles in faith andverity i will therefore that men pray every where lifting up holy handswithout wrath and doubting in like manner also that women adorn themselves in modestapparel with shamefacedness and sobriety not with broided hair orgold or pearls or costly array  but which becometh womenprofessing godliness with good works let the woman learn in silence with all subjection but i suffer not a woman to teach nor to usurp authority overthe man but to be in silence for adam was first formed then eve and adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was inthe transgression notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing if theycontinue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety this is a true saying if a man desire the office of a bishop hedesireth a good work a bishop then must be blameless the husband of one wifevigilant sober of good behaviour given to hospitality apt toteach  not given to wine no striker not greedy of filthy lucrebut patient not a brawler not covetous  one that ruleth well hisown house having his children in subjection with all gravity for if a man know not how to rule his own house how shall he takecare of the church of god   not a novice lest being lifted upwith pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil moreover he must have a good report of them which are withoutlest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil likewise must the deacons be grave not doubletongued not givento much wine not greedy of filthy lucre  holding the mystery ofthe faith in a pure conscience and let these also first be proved then let them use the officeof a deacon being found blameless even so must their wives be grave not slanderers soberfaithful in all things let the deacons be the husbands of one wife ruling theirchildren and their own houses well for they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase tothemselves a good degree and great boldness in the faith which is inchrist jesus these things write i unto thee hoping to come unto thee shortly but if i tarry long that thou mayest know how thou oughtest tobehave thyself in the house of god which is the church of the livinggod the pillar and ground of the truth and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness godwas manifest in the flesh justified in the spirit seen of angelspreached unto the gentiles believed on in the world received up intoglory now the spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times someshall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits anddoctrines of devils  speaking lies in hypocrisy having theirconscience seared with a hot iron  forbidding to marry andcommanding to abstain from meats which god hath created to bereceived with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth for every creature of god is good and nothing to be refused ifit be received with thanksgiving  for it is sanctified by the wordof god and prayer if thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things thoushalt be a good minister of jesus christ nourished up in the words offaith and of good doctrine whereunto thou hast attained but refuse profane and old wives fables and exercise thyselfrather unto godliness for bodily exercise profiteth little but godliness is profitableunto all things having promise of the life that now is and of thatwhich is to come this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation for therefore we both labour and suffer reproach because wetrust in the living god who is the saviour of all men specially ofthose that believe these things command and teach let no man despise thy youth but be thou an example of thebelievers in word in conversation in charity in spirit in faithin purity till i come give attendance to reading to exhortation todoctrine neglect not the gift that is in thee which was given thee byprophecy with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery meditate upon these things give thyself wholly to them that thyprofiting may appear to all take heed unto thyself and unto the doctrine continue in themfor in doing this thou shalt both save thyself and them that hearthee rebuke not an elder but intreat him as a father and the youngermen as brethren  the elder women as mothers the younger assisters with all purity honour widows that are widows indeed but if any widow have children or nephews let them learn first toshew piety at home and to requite their parents for that is good andacceptable before god now she that is a widow indeed and desolate trusteth in god andcontinueth in supplications and prayers night and day but she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth and these things give in charge that they may be blameless but if any provide not for his own and specially for those of hisown house he hath denied the faith and is worse than an infidel let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore yearsold having been the wife of one man well reported of for good works if she have brought up childrenif she have lodged strangers if she have washed the saints feet ifshe have relieved the afflicted if she have diligently followed everygood work but the younger widows refuse for when they have begun to waxwanton against christ they will marry  having damnation becausethey have cast off their first faith and withal they learn to be idle wandering about from house tohouse and not only idle but tattlers also and busybodies speakingthings which they ought not i will therefore that the younger women marry bear childrenguide the house give none occasion to the adversary to speakreproachfully for some are already turned aside after satan if any man or woman that believeth have widows let them relievethem and let not the church be charged that it may relieve them thatare widows indeed let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honourespecially they who labour in the word and doctrine for the scripture saith thou shalt not muzzle the ox thattreadeth out the corn and the labourer is worthy of his reward against an elder receive not an accusation but before two orthree witnesses them that sin rebuke before all that others also may fear i charge thee before god and the lord jesus christ and theelect angels that thou observe these things without preferring onebefore another doing nothing by partiality lay hands suddenly on no man neither be partaker of other menssins keep thyself pure drink no longer water but use a little wine for thy stomachssake and thine often infirmities some mens sins are open beforehand going before to judgmentand some men they follow after likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand andthey that are otherwise cannot be hid let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own mastersworthy of all honour that the name of god and his doctrine be notblasphemed and they that have believing masters let them not despise thembecause they are brethren but rather do them service because theyare faithful and beloved partakers of the benefit these things teachand exhort if any man teach otherwise and consent not to wholesome wordseven the words of our lord jesus christ and to the doctrine which isaccording to godliness  he is proud knowing nothing but dotingabout questions and strifes of words whereof cometh envy striferailings evil surmisings  perverse disputings of men of corruptminds and destitute of the truth supposing that gain is godlinessfrom such withdraw thyself but godliness with contentment is great gain for we brought nothing into this world and it is certain we cancarry nothing out and having food and raiment let us be therewith content but they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare andinto many foolish and hurtful lusts which drown men in destructionand perdition for the love of money is the root of all evil which while somecoveted after they have erred from the faith and pierced themselvesthrough with many sorrows but thou o man of god flee these things and follow afterrighteousness godliness faith love patience meekness fight the good fight of faith lay hold on eternal lifewhereunto thou art also called and hast professed a good professionbefore many witnesses i give thee charge in the sight of god who quickeneth allthings and before christ jesus who before pontius pilate witnessed agood confession  that thou keep this commandment without spotunrebukable until the appearing of our lord jesus christ  whichin his times he shall shew who is the blessed and only potentate theking of kings and lord of lords  who only hath immortalitydwelling in the light which no man can approach unto whom no man hathseen nor can see to whom be honour and power everlasting amen charge them that are rich in this world that they be nothighminded nor trust in uncertain riches but in the living god whogiveth us richly all things to enjoy  that they do good thatthey be rich in good works ready to distribute willing tocommunicate  laying up in store for themselves a good foundationagainst the time to come that they may lay hold on eternal life o timothy keep that which is committed to thy trust avoidingprofane and vain babblings and oppositions of science falsely socalled  which some professing have erred concerning the faithgrace be with thee amenthe second epistle of paul the apostle to timothy paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god according tothe promise of life which is in christ jesus  to timothymy dearly beloved son grace mercy and peace from god the fatherand christ jesus our lord i thank god whom i serve from my forefathers with pureconscience that without ceasing i have remembrance of thee in myprayers night and day  greatly desiring to see thee being mindfulof thy tears that i may be filled with joy  when i call toremembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee which dwelt first inthy grandmother lois and thy mother eunice and i am persuaded thatin thee also wherefore i put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift ofgod which is in thee by the putting on of my hands for god hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power and oflove and of a sound mind be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our lord nor ofme his prisoner but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospelaccording to the power of god  who hath saved us and called uswith an holy calling not according to our works but according to hisown purpose and grace which was given us in christ jesus before theworld began  but is now made manifest by the appearing of oursaviour jesus christ who hath abolished death and hath brought lifeand immortality to light through the gospel  whereunto i amappointed a preacher and an apostle and a teacher of the gentiles for the which cause i also suffer these things nevertheless i amnot ashamed for i know whom i have believed and am persuaded that heis able to keep that which i have committed unto him against that day hold fast the form of sound words which thou hast heard of mein faith and love which is in christ jesus that good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the holyghost which dwelleth in us this thou knowest that all they which are in asia be turned awayfrom me of whom are phygellus and hermogenes the lord give mercy unto the house of onesiphorus for he oftrefreshed me and was not ashamed of my chain  but when he wasin rome he sought me out very diligently and found me the lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the lord inthat day and in how many things he ministered unto me at ephesusthou knowest very well thou therefore my son be strong in the grace that is in christjesus and the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnessesthe same commit thou to faithful men who shall be able to teachothers also thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of jesus christ no man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of thislife that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier and if a man also strive for masteries yet is he not crownedexcept he strive lawfully the husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of thefruits consider what i say and the lord give thee understanding in allthings remember that jesus christ of the seed of david was raised fromthe dead according to my gospel  wherein i suffer trouble as anevil doer even unto bonds but the word of god is not bound therefore i endure all things for the elects sakes that theymay also obtain the salvation which is in christ jesus with eternalglory it is a faithful saying for if we be dead with him we shallalso live with him  if we suffer we shall also reign with himif we deny him he also will deny us  if we believe not yet heabideth faithful he cannot deny himself of these things put them in remembrance charging them before thelord that they strive not about words to no profit but to thesubverting of the hearers study to shew thyself approved unto god a workman that needethnot to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth but shun profane and vain babblings for they will increase untomore ungodliness and their word will eat as doth a canker of whom is hymenaeusand philetus  who concerning the truth have erred saying thatthe resurrection is past already and overthrow the faith of some nevertheless the foundation of god standeth sure having thisseal the lord knoweth them that are his and let every one thatnameth the name of christ depart from iniquity but in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and ofsilver but also of wood and of earth and some to honour and some todishonour if a man therefore purge himself from these he shall be a vesselunto honour sanctified and meet for the masters use and

angry not given to wine no striker not givento filthy lucre  but a lover of hospitality a lover of good mensober just holy temperate  holding fast the faithful word as hehath been taught that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhortand to convince the gainsayers for there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceiversspecially they of the circumcision  whose mouths must be stoppedwho subvert whole houses teaching things which they ought not forfilthy lucres sake one of themselves even a prophet of their own said thecretians are alway liars evil beasts slow bellies this witness is true wherefore rebuke them sharply that theymay be sound in the faith  not giving heed to jewish fables andcommandments of men that turn from the truth unto the pure all things are pure but unto them that are defiledand unbelieving is nothing pure but even their mind and conscience isdefiled they profess that they know god but in works they deny himbeing abominable and disobedient and unto every good work reprobate but speak thou the things which become sound doctrine  thatthe aged men be sober grave temperate sound in faith in charityin patience the aged women likewise that they be in

to be ready to every good work  to speak evil ofno man to be no brawlers but gentle shewing all meekness unto allmen for we ourselves also were sometimes foolish disobedientdeceived serving divers lusts and pleasures living in malice andenvy hateful and hating one another but after that the kindness and love of god our saviour toward manappeared  not by works of righteousness which we have done butaccording to his mercy he saved us by the washing of regenerationand renewing of the holy ghost  which he shed on us abundantlythrough jesus christ our saviour  that being justified by hisgrace we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life this is a faithful saying and these things i will that thouaffirm constantly that they which have believed in god might becareful to maintain

thebowels of the saints are refreshed by thee brother wherefore though i might be much bold in christ to enjoin theethat which is convenient  yet for loves sake i rather beseechthee being such an one as paul the aged and now also a prisoner ofjesus christ i beseech thee for my son onesimus whom i have begotten in mybonds  which in time past was to thee unprofitable but nowprofitable to thee and to me  whom i have sent again thoutherefore receive him that is mine own bowels  whom i wouldhave retained with me that in thy stead he might have ministered untome in the bonds of the gospel  but without thy mind would i donothing that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity butwillingly for perhaps he therefore departed for a season that thoushouldest receive him for ever  not now

lord jesus christ be with your spirit amenthe epistle of paul the apostle to the hebrews god who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time pastunto the fathers by the prophets  hath in these last days spokenunto us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of all things by whomalso he made the worlds  who being the brightness of his gloryand the express image of his person and upholding all things by theword of his power when he had by himself purged our sins sat down onthe right hand of the majesty on high  being made so much betterthan the angels as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellentname than they for unto which of the angels said he at any time thou art my sonthis day have i begotten thee and again i will be to him a fatherand he shall be to me a son   and again when he bringeth in thefirstbegotten into the world he saith and let all the angels of godworship him and of the angels he saith who maketh his angels spirits and hisministers a flame of fire but unto the son he saith thy throne o god is for ever andever a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom thou hast loved righteousness and hated iniquity therefore godeven thy god hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thyfellows and thou lord in the beginning hast laid the foundation of theearth and the heavens are the works of thine hands  they shallperish but thou remainest and they all shall wax old as doth agarment  and as a vesture shalt thou fold them up and they shallbe changed but thou art the same and thy years shall not fail but to which of the angels said he at any time sit on my righthand until i make thine enemies thy footstool   are they not allministering spirits sent forth to minister for them who shall beheirs of salvation   therefore we ought to give the more earnestheed to the things which we have heard lest at any time we should letthem slip for if the word spoken by angels was stedfast and everytransgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation which atthe first began to be spoken by the lord and was confirmed unto us bythem that heard him  god also bearing them witness both withsigns and wonders and with divers miracles and gifts of the holyghost according to his own will   for unto the angels hath he notput in subjection the world to come whereof we speak but one in a certain place testified saying what is man thatthou art mindful of him or the son of man that thou visitest him thou madest him a little lower than the angels thou crownedst himwith glory and honour and didst set him over the works of thy hands thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet for in thathe put all in subjection under him he left nothing that is not putunder himbut now we see not yet all things put under him but we see jesus who was made a little lower than the angels forthe suffering of death crowned with glory and honour that he by thegrace of god should taste death for every man for it became him for whom are all things and by whom are allthings in bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of theirsalvation perfect through sufferings for both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are allof one for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren saying i will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of thechurch will i sing praise unto thee and again i will put my trust in him and again behold i andthe children which god hath given me forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and bloodhe also himself likewise took part of the same that through death hemight destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil and deliver them who through fear of death were all theirlifetime subject to bondage for verily he took not on him the nature of angels but he tookon him the seed of abraham wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto hisbrethren that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest inthings pertaining to god to make reconciliation for the sins of thepeople for in that he himself hath suffered being tempted he is able tosuccour them that are tempted wherefore holy brethren partakers of the heavenly callingconsider the apostle and high priest of our profession christ jesus who was faithful to him that appointed him as also moses wasfaithful in all his house for this man was counted worthy of more glory than moses inasmuchas he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house for every house is builded by some man but he that built allthings is god and moses verily was faithful in all his house as a servant fora testimony of those things which were to be spoken after  butchrist as a son over his own house whose house are we if we holdfast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end wherefore as the holy ghost saith to day if ye will hear hisvoice  harden not your hearts as in the provocation in the dayof temptation in the wilderness  when your fathers tempted meproved me and saw my works forty years wherefore i was grieved with that generation and said they doalway err in their heart and they have not known my ways so i sware in my wrath they shall not enter into my rest  take heed brethren lest there be in any of you an evil heart ofunbelief in departing from the living god but exhort one another daily while it is called to day lest anyof you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin for we are made partakers of christ if we hold the beginning ofour confidence stedfast unto the end  while it is said to day ifye will hear his voice harden not your hearts as in the provocation for some when they had heard did provoke howbeit not all thatcame out of egypt by moses but with whom was he grieved forty years was it not with themthat had sinned whose carcases fell in the wilderness   and towhom sware he that they should not enter into his rest but to themthat believed not   so we see that they could not enter inbecause of unbelief let us therefore fear lest a promise being left us of enteringinto his rest any of you should seem to come short of it for unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them but theword preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in themthat heard it for we which have believed do enter into rest as he said as ihave sworn in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest although theworks were finished from the foundation of the world for he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wiseand god did rest the seventh day from all his works and in this place again if they shall enter into my rest seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein andthey to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief again he limiteth a certain day saying in david to day afterso long a time as it is said to day if ye will hear his voiceharden not your hearts for if jesus had given them rest then would he not afterward havespoken of another day there remaineth therefore a rest to the people of god for he that is entered into his rest he also hath ceased fromhis own works as god did from his let us labour therefore to enter into that rest lest any manfall after the same example of unbelief for the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than anytwoedged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul andspirit and of the joints and marrow and is a discerner of thethoughts and intents of the heart neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sightbut all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom wehave to do seeing then that we have a great high priest that is passed intothe heavens jesus the son of god let us hold fast our profession for we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with thefeeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as weare yet without sin let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that wemay obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need for every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men inthings pertaining to god that he may offer both gifts and sacrificesfor sins  who can have compassion on the ignorant and on themthat are out of the way for that he himself also is compassed withinfirmity and by reason hereof he ought as for the people so also forhimself to offer for sins and no man taketh this honour unto himself but he that is calledof god as was aaron so also christ glorified not himself to be made an high priestbut he that said unto him thou art my son to day have i begottenthee as he saith also in another place thou art a priest for everafter the order of melchisedec who in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers andsupplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able tosave him from death and was heard in that he feared  though hewere a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvationunto all them that obey him  called of god an high priest afterthe order of melchisedec of whom we have many things to say and hard to be utteredseeing ye are dull of hearing for when for the time ye ought to be teachers ye have need thatone teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles ofgod and are become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat for every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word ofrighteousness for he is a babe but strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age eventhose who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern bothgood and evil therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ let usgo on unto perfection not laying again the foundation of repentancefrom dead works and of faith toward god  of the doctrine ofbaptisms and of laying on of hands and of resurrection of the deadand of eternal judgment and this will we do if god permit for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and havetasted of the heavenly gift and were made partakers of the holyghost  and have tasted the good word of god and the powers of theworld to come  if they shall fall away to renew them again untorepentance seeing they crucify to themselves the son of god afreshand put him to an open shame for the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon itand bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressedreceiveth blessing from god  but that which beareth thorns andbriers is rejected and is nigh unto cursing whose end is to beburned but beloved we are persuaded better things of you and thingsthat accompany salvation though we thus speak for god is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour oflove which ye have shewed toward his name in that ye have ministeredto the saints and do minister and we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence tothe full assurance of hope unto the end  that ye be not slothfulbut followers of them who through faith and patience inherit thepromises for when god made promise to abraham because he could swear byno greater he sware by himself  saying surely blessing i willbless thee and multiplying i will multiply thee and so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise for men verily swear by the greater and an oath for confirmationis to them an end of all strife wherein god willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs ofpromise the immutability of his counsel confirmed it by an oath that by two immutable things in which it was impossible for god tolie we might have a strong consolation who have fled for refuge tolay hold upon the hope set before us  which hope we have as ananchor of the soul both sure and stedfast and which entereth intothat within the veil  whither the forerunner is for us enteredeven jesus made an high priest for ever after the order ofmelchisedec for this melchisedec king of salem priest of the most high godwho met abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessedhim  to whom also abraham gave a tenth part of all first being byinterpretation king of righteousness and after that also king ofsalem which is king of peace  without father without motherwithout descent having neither beginning of days nor end of lifebut made like unto the son of god abideth a priest continually now consider how great this man was unto whom even the patriarchabraham gave the tenth of the spoils and verily they that are of the sons of levi who receive theoffice of the priesthood have a commandment to take tithes of thepeople according to the law that is of their brethren though theycome out of the loins of abraham  but he whose descent is notcounted from them received tithes of abraham and blessed him that hadthe promises and without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better and here men that die receive tithes but there he receiveth themof whom it is witnessed that he liveth and as i may so say levi also who receiveth tithes payed tithesin abraham for he was yet in the loins of his father when melchisedec methim if therefore perfection were by the levitical priesthood forunder it the people received the law what further need was therethat another priest should rise after the order of melchisedec andnot be called after the order of aaron   for the priesthood beingchanged there is made of necessity a change also of the law for he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to anothertribe of which no man gave attendance at the altar for it is evident that our lord sprang out of juda of whichtribe moses spake nothing concerning priesthood and it is yet far more evident for that after the similitude ofmelchisedec there ariseth another priest  who is made not afterthe law of a carnal commandment but after the power of an endlesslife for he testifieth thou art a priest for ever after the order ofmelchisedec for there is verily a disannulling of the commandment goingbefore for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof for the law made nothing perfect but the bringing in of a betterhope did by the which we draw nigh unto god and inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest  forthose priests were made without an oath but this with an oath by himthat said unto him the lord sware and will not repent thou art apriest for ever after the order of melchisedec  by so much wasjesus made a surety of a better testament and they truly were many priests because they were not sufferedto continue by reason of death  but this man because hecontinueth ever hath an unchangeable priesthood wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that comeunto god by him seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them for such an high priest became us who is holy harmlessundefiled separate from sinners and made higher than the heavens who needeth not daily as those high priests to offer upsacrifice first for his own sins and then for the peoples for thishe did once when he offered up himself for the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity but theword of the oath which was since the law maketh the son who isconsecrated for evermore now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum we havesuch an high priest who is set on the right hand of the throne of themajesty in the heavens  a minister of the sanctuary and of thetrue tabernacle which the lord pitched and not man for every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrificeswherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also tooffer for if he were on earth he should not be a priest seeing thatthere are priests that offer gifts according to the law  who serveunto the example and shadow of heavenly things as moses wasadmonished of god when he was about to make the tabernacle for seesaith he that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed tothee in the mount but now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry by how muchalso he is the mediator of a better covenant which was establishedupon better promises for if that first covenant had been faultless then should noplace have been sought for the second for finding fault with them he saith behold the days comesaith the lord when i will make a new covenant with the house ofisrael and with the house of judah  not according to the covenantthat i made with their fathers in the day when i took them by the handto lead them out of the land of egypt because they continued not inmy covenant and i regarded them not saith the lord for this is the covenant that i will make with the house ofisrael after those days saith the lord i will put my laws into theirmind and write them in their hearts and i will be to them a god andthey shall be to me a people  and they shall not teach every manhis neighbour and every man his brother saying know the lord forall shall know me from the least to the greatest for i will be merciful to their unrighteousness and their sinsand their iniquities will i remember no more in that he saith a new covenant he hath made the first old nowthat which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divineservice and a worldly sanctuary for there was a tabernacle made the first wherein was thecandlestick and the table and the shewbread which is called thesanctuary and after the second veil the tabernacle which is called theholiest of all  which had the golden censer and the ark of thecovenant overlaid round about with gold wherein was the golden potthat had manna and aarons rod that budded and the tables of thecovenant  and over it the cherubims of glory shadowing themercyseat of which we cannot now speak particularly now when these things were thus ordained the priests went alwaysinto the first tabernacle accomplishing the service of god but into the second went the high priest alone once every yearnot without blood which he offered for himself and for the errors ofthe people  the holy ghost this signifying that the way into theholiest of all was not yet made manifest while as the firsttabernacle was yet standing  which was a figure for the time thenpresent in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices that couldnot make him that did the service perfect as pertaining to theconscience  which stood only in meats and drinks and diverswashings and carnal ordinances imposed on them until the time ofreformation but christ being come an high priest of good things to come by agreater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is tosay not of this building  neither by the blood of goats andcalves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy placehaving obtained eternal redemption for us for if the blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes of anheifer sprinkling the unclean sanctifieth to the purifying of theflesh  how much more shall the blood of christ who through theeternal spirit offered himself without spot to god purge yourconscience from dead works to serve the living god   and for thiscause he is the mediator of the new testament that by means of deathfor the redemption of the transgressions that were under the firsttestament they which are called might receive the promise of eternalinheritance for where a testament is there must also of necessity be thedeath of the testator for a testament is of force after men are dead otherwise it isof no strength at all while the testator liveth whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated withoutblood for when moses had spoken every precept to all the peopleaccording to the law he took the blood of calves and of goats withwater and scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkled both the book andall the people  saying this is the blood of the testament whichgod hath enjoined unto you moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle and all thevessels of the ministry and almost all things are by the law purged with blood andwithout shedding of blood is no remission it was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in theheavens should be purified with these but the heavenly thingsthemselves with better sacrifices than these for christ is not entered into the holy places made with handswhich are the figures of the true but into heaven itself now toappear in the presence of god for us  nor yet that he shouldoffer himself often as the high priest entereth into the holy placeevery year with blood of others  for then must he often havesuffered since the foundation of the world but now once in the end ofthe world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice ofhimself and as it is appointed unto men once to die but after this thejudgment  so christ was once offered to bear the sins of manyand unto them that look for him shall he appear the second timewithout sin unto salvation for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not thevery image of the things can never with those sacrifices which theyoffered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect for then would they not have ceased to be offered because thatthe worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience ofsins but in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sinsevery year for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goatsshould take away sins wherefore when he cometh into the world he saith sacrifice andoffering thou wouldest not but a body hast thou prepared me  inburnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure then said i lo i come in the volume of the book it is writtenof me to do thy will o god above when he said sacrifice and offering and burnt offeringsand offering for sin thou wouldest not neither hadst pleasuretherein which are offered by the law  then said he lo i cometo do thy will o god he taketh away the first that he may establishthe second by the which will we are sanctified through the offering of thebody of jesus christ once for all and every priest standeth daily ministering and offeringoftentimes the same sacrifices which can never take away sins but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for eversat down on the right hand of god  from henceforth expectingtill his enemies be made his footstool for by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that aresanctified whereof the holy ghost also is a witness to us for after thathe had said before  this is the covenant that i will make withthem after those days saith the lord i will put my laws into theirhearts and in their minds will i write them  and their sins andiniquities will i remember no more now where remission of these is there is no more offering forsin having therefore brethren boldness to enter into the holiestby the blood of jesus  by a new and living way which he hathconsecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh and having an high priest over the house of god  let us drawnear with a true heart in full assurance of faith having our heartssprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with purewater let us hold fast the profession of our faith without waveringfor he is faithful that promised  and let us consider oneanother to provoke unto love and to good works  not forsakingthe assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is butexhorting one another and so much the more as ye see the dayapproaching for if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledgeof the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins  but acertain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation whichshall devour the adversaries he that despised moses law died without mercy under two orthree witnesses  of how much sorer punishment suppose ye shallhe be thought worthy who hath trodden under foot the son of god andhath counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was sanctifiedan unholy thing and hath done despite unto the spirit of grace for we know him that hath said vengeance belongeth unto me iwill recompense saith the lord and again the lord shall judge hispeople it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living god but call to remembrance the former days in which after ye wereilluminated ye endured a great fight of afflictions  partlywhilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictionsand partly whilst ye became companions of them that were so used for ye had compassion of me in my bonds and took joyfully thespoiling of your goods knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven abetter and an enduring substance cast not away therefore your confidence which hath greatrecompence of reward for ye have need of patience that after ye have done the willof god ye might receive the promise for yet a little while and he that shall come will come andwill not tarry now the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back mysoul shall have no pleasure in him but we are not of them who draw back unto perdition but of themthat believe to the saving of the soul now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence ofthings not seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by theword of god so that things which are seen were not made of thingswhich do appear by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice thancain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous godtestifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh by faith enoch was translated that he should not see death andwas not found because god had translated him for before histranslation he had this testimony that he pleased god but without faith it is impossible to please him for he thatcometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder ofthem that diligently seek him by faith noah being warned of god of things not seen as yetmoved with fear prepared an ark to the saving of his house by thewhich he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousnesswhich is by faith by faith abraham when he was called to go out into a place whichhe should after receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went outnot knowing whither he went by faith he sojourned in the land of promise as in a strangecountry dwelling in tabernacles with isaac and jacob the heirs withhim of the same promise  for he looked for a city which hathfoundations whose builder and maker is god through faith also sara herself received strength to conceiveseed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because shejudged him faithful who had promised therefore sprang there even of one and him as good as dead somany as the stars of the sky in multitude and as the sand which is bythe sea shore innumerable these all died in faith not having received the promises buthaving seen them afar off and were persuaded of them and embracedthem and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on theearth for they that say such things declare plainly that they seek acountry and truly if they had been mindful of that country from whencethey came out they might have had opportunity to have returned but now they desire a better country that is an heavenlywherefore god is not ashamed to be called their god for he hathprepared for them a city by faith abraham when he was tried offered up isaac and hethat had received the promises offered up his only begotten son of whom it was said that in isaac shall thy seed be called accounting that god was able to raise him up even from the dead fromwhence also he received him in a figure by faith isaac blessed jacob and esau concerning things to come by faith jacob when he was a dying blessed both the sons ofjoseph and worshipped leaning upon the top of his staff by faith joseph when he died made mention of the departing ofthe children of israel and gave commandment concerning his bones by faith moses when he was born was hid three months of hisparents because they saw he was a proper child and they were notafraid of the kings commandment by faith moses when he was come to years refused to be calledthe son of pharaohs daughter  choosing rather to sufferaffliction with the people of god than to enjoy the pleasures of sinfor a season  esteeming the reproach of christ greater richesthan the treasures in egypt for he had respect unto the recompence ofthe reward by faith he forsook egypt not fearing the wrath of the kingfor he endured as seeing him who is invisible through faith he kept the passover and the sprinkling of bloodlest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them by faith they passed through the red sea as by dry land whichthe egyptians assaying to do were drowned by faith the walls of jericho fell down after they werecompassed about seven days by faith the harlot rahab perished not with them that believednot when she had received the spies with peace and what shall i more say for the time would fail me to tell ofgedeon and of barak and of samson and of jephthae of david alsoand samuel and of the prophets  who through faith subduedkingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouthsof lions quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the swordout of weakness were made strong waxed valiant in fight turned toflight the armies of the aliens women received their dead raised to life again and others weretortured not accepting deliverance that they might obtain a betterresurrection  and others had trial of cruel mockings andscourgings yea moreover of bonds and imprisonment  they werestoned they were sawn asunder were tempted were slain with thesword they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins beingdestitute afflicted tormented  of whom the world was notworthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens andcaves of the earth and these all having obtained a good report through faithreceived not the promise  god having provided some better thingfor us that they without us should not be made perfect wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great acloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin whichdoth so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that isset before us  looking unto jesus the author and finisher of ourfaith who for the joy that was set before him endured the crossdespising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throneof god for consider him that endured such contradiction of sinnersagainst himself lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds ye have not yet resisted unto blood striving against sin and ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you asunto children my son despise not thou the chastening of the lordnor faint when thou art rebuked of him  for whom the lord lovethhe chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth if ye endure chastening god dealeth with you as with sons forwhat son is he whom the father chasteneth not   but if ye bewithout chastisement whereof all are partakers then are ye bastardsand not sons furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected usand we gave them reverence shall we not much rather be in subjectionunto the father of spirits and live   for they verily for a fewdays chastened us after their own pleasure but he for our profitthat we might be partakers of his holiness now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous butgrievous nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit ofrighteousness unto them which are exercised thereby wherefore lift up the hands which hang down and the feebleknees  and make straight paths for your feet lest that which islame be turned out of the way but let it rather be healed follow peace with all men and holiness without which no manshall see the lord  looking diligently lest any man fail of thegrace of god lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble youand thereby many be defiled  lest there be any fornicator orprofane person as esau who for one morsel of meat sold hisbirthright for ye know how that afterward when he would have inherited theblessing he was rejected for he found no place of repentance thoughhe sought it carefully with tears for ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched andthat burned with fire nor unto blackness and darkness and tempest and the sound of a trumpet and the voice of words which voicethey that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to themany more  for they could not endure that which was commandedand if so much as a beast touch the mountain it shall be stoned orthrust through with a dart  and so terrible was the sight thatmoses said i exceedingly fear and quake  but ye are come untomount sion and unto the city of the living god the heavenlyjerusalem and to an innumerable company of angels  to thegeneral assembly and church of the firstborn which are written inheaven and to god the judge of all and to the spirits of just menmade perfect  and to jesus the mediator of the new covenant andto the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that ofabel see that ye refuse not him that speaketh for if they escapednot who refused him that spake on earth much more shall not weescape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven whose voice then shook the earth but now he hath promised sayingyet once more i shake not the earth only but also heaven and this word yet once more signifieth the removing of thosethings that are shaken as of things that are made that those thingswhich cannot be shaken may remain wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let ushave grace whereby we may serve god acceptably with reverence andgodly fear  for our god is a consuming fire let brotherly love continue be not forgetful to entertain strangers for thereby some haveentertained angels unawares remember them that are in bonds as bound with them and themwhich suffer adversity as being yourselves also in the body marriage is honourable in all and the bed undefiled butwhoremongers and adulterers god will judge let your conversation be without covetousness and be contentwith such things as ye have for he hath said i will never leavethee nor forsake thee so that we may boldly say the lord is my helper and i will notfear what man shall do unto me remember them which have the rule over you who have spoken untoyou the word of god whose faith follow considering the end of theirconversation jesus christ the same yesterday and to day and for ever be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines for it isa good thing that the heart be established with grace not with meatswhich have not profited them that have been occupied therein we have an altar whereof they have no right to eat which servethe tabernacle for the bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into thesanctuary by the high priest for sin are burned without the camp wherefore jesus also that he might sanctify the people with hisown blood suffered without the gate let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp bearing hisreproach for here have we no continuing city but we seek one to come by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to godcontinually that is the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name but to do good and to communicate forget not for with suchsacrifices god is well pleased obey them that have the rule over you and submit yourselvesfor they watch for your souls as they that must give account thatthey may do it with joy and not with grief for that is unprofitablefor you pray for us for we trust we have a good conscience in allthings willing to live honestly but i beseech you the rather to do this that i may be restoredto you the sooner now the god of peace that brought again from the dead our lordjesus that great shepherd of the sheep through the blood of theeverlasting covenant  make you perfect in every good work to dohis will working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sightthrough jesus christ to whom be glory for ever and ever amen and i beseech you brethren suffer the word of exhortation fori have written a letter unto you in few words know ye that our brother timothy is set at liberty with whomif he come shortly i will see you salute all them that have the rule over you and all the saintsthey of italy salute you grace be with you all amenthe general epistle of james james a servant of god and of the lord jesus christto the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad greeting my brethren count it all joy when ye fall into diverstemptations  knowing this that the trying of your faith workethpatience but let patience have her perfect work that ye may be perfect andentire wanting nothing if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of god that giveth to allmen liberally and upbraideth not and it shall be given him but let him ask in faith nothing wavering for he that waverethis like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed for let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of thelord a double minded man is unstable in all his ways let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted but the rich in that he is made low because as the flower of thegrass he shall pass away for the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat but itwithereth the grass and the flower thereof falleth and the grace ofthe fashion of it perisheth so also shall the rich man fade away inhis ways blessed is the man that endureth temptation for when he istried he shall receive the crown of life which the lord hathpromised to them that love him let no man say when he is tempted i am tempted of god for godcannot be tempted with evil neither tempteth he any man  butevery man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust andenticed then when lust hath conceived it bringeth forth sin and sinwhen it is finished bringeth forth death do not err my beloved brethren every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and comethdown from the father of lights with whom is no variableness neithershadow of turning of his own will begat he us with the word of truth that weshould be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures wherefore my beloved brethren let every man be swift to hearslow to speak slow to wrath  for the wrath of man worketh notthe righteousness of god wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity ofnaughtiness and receive with meekness the engrafted word which isable to save your souls but be ye doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving yourown selves for if any be a hearer of the word and not a doer he is likeunto a man beholding his natural face in a glass  for hebeholdeth himself and goeth his way and straightway forgetteth whatmanner of man he was but whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty and continueththerein he being not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work thisman shall be blessed in his deed if any man among you seem to be religious and bridleth not histongue but deceiveth his own heart this mans religion is vain pure religion and undefiled before god and the father is this tovisit the fatherless and widows in their affliction and to keephimself unspotted from the world my brethren have not the faith of our lord jesus christ the lordof glory with respect of persons for if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring ingoodly apparel and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment and ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing and say untohim sit thou here in a good place and say to the poor stand thouthere or sit here under my footstool  are ye not then partial inyourselves and are become judges of evil thoughts   hearken mybeloved brethren hath not god chosen the poor of this world rich infaith and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them thatlove him   but ye have despised the poor do not rich men oppressyou and draw you before the judgment seats   do not theyblaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called   if yefulfil the royal law according to the scripture thou shalt love thyneighbour as thyself ye do well  but if ye have respect topersons ye commit sin and are convinced of the law as transgressors for whosoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend in onepoint he is guilty of all for he that said do not commit adultery said also do not killnow if thou commit no adultery yet if thou kill thou art become atransgressor of the law so speak ye and so do as they that shall be judged by the lawof liberty for he shall have judgment without mercy that hath shewed nomercy and mercy rejoiceth against judgment what doth it profit my brethren though a man say he hath faithand have not works can faith save him   if a brother or sisterbe naked and destitute of daily food  and one of you say untothem depart in peace be ye warmed and filled notwithstanding yegive them not those things which are needful to the body what doth itprofit   even so faith if it hath not works is dead beingalone yea a man may say thou hast faith and i have works shew methy faith without thy works and i will shew thee my faith by myworks thou believest that there is one god thou doest well the devilsalso believe and tremble but wilt thou know o vain man that faith without works is dead was not abraham our father justified by works when he hadoffered isaac his son upon the altar   seest thou how faithwrought with his works and by works was faith made perfect   andthe scripture was fulfilled which saith abraham believed god and itwas imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the friendof god ye see then how that by works a man is justified and not byfaith only likewise also was not rahab the harlot justified by works whenshe had received the messengers and had sent them out another way for as the body without the spirit is dead so faith withoutworks is dead also my brethren be not many masters knowing that we shall receivethe greater condemnation for in many things we offend all if any man offend not in wordthe same is a perfect man and able also to bridle the whole body behold we put bits in the horses mouths that they may obey usand we turn about their whole body behold also the ships which though they be so great and aredriven of fierce winds yet are they turned about with a very smallhelm whithersoever the governor listeth even so the tongue is a little member and boasteth great thingsbehold how great a matter a little fire kindleth   and the tongueis a fire a world of iniquity so is the tongue among our membersthat it defileth the whole body and setteth on fire the course ofnature and it is set on fire of hell for every kind of beasts and of birds and of serpents and ofthings in the sea is tamed and hath been tamed of mankind  butthe tongue can no man tame it is an unruly evil full of deadlypoison therewith bless we god even the father and therewith curse wemen which are made after the similitude of god out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing mybrethren these things ought not so to be doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water andbitter   can the fig tree my brethren bear olive berrieseither a vine figs so can no fountain both yield salt water andfresh who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you let himshew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom but if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts glorynot and lie not against the truth this wisdom descendeth not from above but is earthly sensualdevilish for where envying and strife is there is confusion and everyevil work but the wisdom that is from above is first pure then peaceablegentle and easy to be intreated full of mercy and good fruitswithout partiality and without hypocrisy and the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that makepeace from whence come wars and fightings among you come they nothence even of your lusts that war in your members   ye lust andhave not ye kill and desire to have and cannot obtain ye fight andwar yet ye have not because ye ask not ye ask and receive not because ye ask amiss that ye may consumeit upon your lusts ye adulterers and adulteresses know ye not that the friendship ofthe world is enmity with god whosoever therefore will be a friend ofthe world is the enemy of god do ye think that the scripture saith in vain the spirit thatdwelleth in us lusteth to envy   but he giveth more gracewherefore he saith god resisteth the proud but giveth grace unto thehumble submit yourselves therefore to god resist the devil and he willflee from you draw nigh to god and he will draw nigh to you cleanse yourhands ye sinners and purify your hearts ye double minded be afflicted and mourn and weep let your laughter be turned tomourning and your joy to heaviness humble yourselves in the sight of the lord and he shall lift youup speak not evil one of another brethren he that speaketh evil ofhis brother and judgeth his brother speaketh evil of the law andjudgeth the law but if thou judge the law thou art not a doer of thelaw but a judge there is one lawgiver who is able to save and to destroy whoart thou that judgest another   go to now ye that say to day orto morrow we will go into such a city and continue there a year andbuy and sell and get gain  whereas ye know not what shall be onthe morrow for what is your life it is even a vapour that appearethfor a little time and then vanisheth away for that ye ought to say if the lord will we shall live and dothis or that but now ye rejoice in your boastings all such rejoicing is evil therefore to him that knoweth to do good and doeth it not tohim it is sin go to now ye rich men weep and howl for your miseries that shallcome upon you your riches are corrupted and your garments are motheaten your gold and silver is cankered and the rust of them shall be awitness against you and shall eat your flesh as it were fire ye haveheaped treasure together for the last days behold the hire of the labourers who have reaped down yourfields which is of you kept back by fraud crieth and the cries ofthem which have reaped are entered into the ears of the lord ofsabaoth ye have lived in pleasure on the earth and been wanton ye havenourished your hearts as in a day of slaughter ye have condemned and killed the just and he doth not resist you be patient therefore brethren unto the coming of the lordbehold the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earthand hath long patience for it until he receive the early and latterrain be ye also patient stablish your hearts for the coming of thelord draweth nigh grudge not one against another brethren lest ye be condemnedbehold the judge standeth before the door take my brethren the prophets who have spoken in the name ofthe lord for an example of suffering affliction and of patience behold we count them happy which endure ye have heard of thepatience of job and have seen the end of the lord that the lord isvery pitiful and of tender mercy but above all things my brethren swear not neither by heavenneither by the earth neither by any other oath but let your yea beyea and your nay nay lest ye fall into condemnation is any among you afflicted let him pray is any merry let himsing psalms is any sick among you let him call for the elders of the churchand let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of thelord  and the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the lordshall raise him up and if he have committed sins they shall beforgiven him confess your faults one to another and pray one for anotherthat ye may be healed the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous manavaileth much elias was a man subject to like passions as we are and he prayedearnestly that it might not rain and it rained not on the earth bythe space of three years and six months and he prayed again and the heaven gave rain and the earthbrought forth her fruit brethren if any of you do err from the truth and one converthim  let him know that he which converteth the sinner from theerror of his way shall save a soul from death and shall hide amultitude of sinsthe first epistle general of peter peter an apostle of jesus christ to the strangers scatteredthroughout pontus galatia cappadocia asia and bithynia  electaccording to the foreknowledge of god the father throughsanctification of the spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of theblood of jesus christ grace unto you and peace be multiplied blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ whichaccording to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a livelyhope by the resurrection of jesus christ from the dead  to aninheritance incorruptible and undefiled and that fadeth not awayreserved in heaven for you  who are kept by the power of godthrough faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time wherein ye greatly rejoice though now for a season if need beye are in heaviness through manifold temptations  that the trialof your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheththough it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honourand glory at the appearing of jesus christ  whom having not seenye love in whom though now ye see him not yet believing ye rejoicewith joy unspeakable and full of glory  receiving the end of yourfaith even the salvation of your souls of which salvation the prophets have enquired and searcheddiligently who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you searching what or what manner of time the spirit of christ whichwas in them did signify when it testified beforehand the sufferingsof christ and the glory that should follow unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves but unto usthey did minister the things which are now reported unto you by themthat have preached the gospel unto you with the holy ghost sent downfrom heaven which things the angels desire to look into wherefore gird up the loins of your mind be sober and hope tothe end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelationof jesus christ  as obedient children not fashioning yourselvesaccording to the former lusts in your ignorance  but as he whichhath called you is holy so be ye holy in all manner of conversation because it is written be ye holy for i am holy and if ye call on the father who without respect of personsjudgeth according to every mans work pass the time of yoursojourning here in fear  forasmuch as ye know that ye were notredeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold from your vainconversation received by tradition from your fathers  but withthe precious blood of christ as of a lamb without blemish and withoutspot  who verily was foreordained before the foundation of theworld but was manifest in these last times for you  who by himdo believe in god that raised him up from the dead and gave himglory that your faith and hope might be in god seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth throughthe spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren see that ye love oneanother with a pure heart fervently  being born again not ofcorruptible seed but of incorruptible by the word of god whichliveth and abideth for ever for all flesh is as grass and all the glory of man as the flowerof grass the grass withereth and the flower thereof falleth away but the word of the lord endureth for ever and this is the wordwhich by the gospel is preached unto you wherefore laying aside all malice and all guile and hypocrisiesand envies all evil speakings  as newborn babes desire thesincere milk of the word that ye may grow thereby  if so be yehave tasted that the lord is gracious to whom coming as unto a living stone disallowed indeed of menbut chosen of god and precious  ye also as lively stones arebuilt up a spiritual house an holy priesthood to offer up spiritualsacrifices acceptable to god by jesus christ wherefore also it is contained in the scripture behold i lay insion a chief corner stone elect precious and he that believeth onhim shall not be confounded unto you therefore which believe he is precious but unto themwhich be disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed thesame is made the head of the corner  and a stone of stumbling anda rock of offence even to them which stumble at the word beingdisobedient whereunto also they were appointed but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood an holynation a peculiar people that ye should shew forth the praises ofhim who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light which in time past were not a people but are now the people ofgod which had not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy dearly beloved i beseech you as strangers and pilgrims abstainfrom fleshly lusts which war against the soul  having yourconversation honest among the gentiles that whereas they speakagainst you as evildoers they may by your good works which theyshall behold glorify god in the day of visitation submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the lords sakewhether it be to the king as supreme  or unto governors as untothem that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and for thepraise of them that do well for so is the will of god that with well doing ye may put tosilence the ignorance of foolish men  as free and not using yourliberty for a cloke of maliciousness but as the servants of god honour all men love the brotherhood fear god honour the king servants be subject to your masters with all fear not only tothe good and gentle but also to the froward for this is thankworthy if a man for conscience toward godendure grief suffering wrongfully for what glory is it if when ye be buffeted for your faults yeshall take it patiently but if when ye do well and suffer for itye take it patiently this is acceptable with god for even hereunto were ye called because christ also sufferedfor us leaving us an example that ye should follow his steps who did no sin neither was guile found in his mouth  who whenhe was reviled reviled not again when he suffered he threatenednot but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously  whohis own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree that we beingdead to sins should live unto righteousness by whose stripes ye werehealed for ye were as sheep going astray but are now returned unto theshepherd and bishop of your souls likewise ye wives be in subjection to your own husbands thatif any obey not the word they also may without the word be won by theconversation of the wives  while they behold your chasteconversation coupled with fear whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting thehair and of wearing of gold or of putting on of apparel  but letit be the hidden man of the heart in that which is not corruptibleeven the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit which is in the sight ofgod of great price for after this manner in the old time the holy women also whotrusted in god adorned themselves being in subjection unto their ownhusbands  even as sara obeyed abraham calling him lord whosedaughters ye are as long as ye do well and are not afraid with anyamazement likewise ye husbands dwell with them according to knowledgegiving honour unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel and as beingheirs together of the grace of life that your prayers be nothindered finally be ye all of one mind having compassion one of anotherlove as brethren be pitiful be courteous  not rendering evil forevil or railing for railing but contrariwise blessing knowing thatye are thereunto called that ye should inherit a blessing for he that will love life and see good days let him refrainhis tongue from evil and his lips that they speak no guile  lethim eschew evil and do good let him seek peace and ensue it for the eyes of the lord are over the righteous and his ears areopen unto their prayers but the face of the lord is against them thatdo evil and who is he that will harm you if ye be followers of thatwhich is good   but and if ye suffer for righteousness sakehappy are ye and be not afraid of their terror neither be troubled but sanctify the lord god in your hearts and be ready always togive an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope thatis in you with meekness and fear  having a good conscience thatwhereas they speak evil of you as of evildoers they may be ashamedthat falsely accuse your good conversation in christ for it is better if the will of god be so that ye suffer forwell doing than for evil doing for christ also hath once suffered for sins the just for theunjust that he might bring us to god being put to death in theflesh but quickened by the spirit  by which also he went andpreached unto the spirits in prison  which sometime weredisobedient when once the longsuffering of god waited in the days ofnoah while the ark was a preparing wherein few that is eight soulswere saved by water the like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us notthe putting away of the filth of the flesh but the answer of a goodconscience toward god by the resurrection of jesus christ  whois gone into heaven and is on the right hand of god angels andauthorities and powers being made subject unto him forasmuch then as christ hath suffered for us in the flesh armyourselves likewise with the same mind for he that hath suffered inthe flesh hath ceased from sin  that he no longer should live therest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men but to the will ofgod for the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought thewill of the gentiles when we walked in lasciviousness lusts excessof wine revellings banquetings and abominable idolatries wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the sameexcess of riot speaking evil of you  who shall give account tohim that is ready to judge the quick and the dead for for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that aredead that they might be judged according to men in the flesh butlive according to god in the spirit but the end of all things is at hand be ye therefore sober andwatch unto prayer and above all things have fervent charity among yourselves forcharity shall cover the multitude of sins use hospitality one to another without grudging as every man hath received the gift even so minister the sameone to another as good stewards of the manifold grace of god if any man speak let him speak as the oracles of god if any manminister let him do it as of the ability which god giveth that godin all things may be glorified through jesus christ to whom be praiseand dominion for ever and ever amen beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which isto try you as though some strange thing happened unto you  butrejoice inasmuch as ye are partakers of christs sufferings thatwhen his glory shall be revealed ye may be glad also with exceedingjoy if ye be reproached for the name of christ happy are ye for thespirit of glory and of god resteth upon you on their part he is evilspoken of but on your part he is glorified but let none of you suffer as a murderer or as a thief or as anevildoer or as a busybody in other mens matters yet if any man suffer as a christian let him not be ashamed butlet him glorify god on this behalf for the time is come that judgment must begin at the house ofgod and if it first begin at us what shall the end be of them thatobey not the gospel of god   and if the righteous scarcely besaved where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear   whereforelet them that suffer according to the will of god commit the keepingof their souls to him in well doing as unto a faithful creator the elders which are among you i exhort who am also an elder anda witness of the sufferings of christ and also a partaker of theglory that shall be revealed  feed the flock of god which is amongyou taking the oversight thereof not by constraint but willinglynot for filthy lucre but of a ready mind  neither as being lordsover gods heritage but being ensamples to the flock and when the chief shepherd shall appear ye shall receive a crownof glory that fadeth not away likewise ye younger submit yourselves unto the elder yea allof you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility forgod resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of god that hemay exalt you in due time  casting all your care upon him for hecareth for you be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as aroaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour  whomresist stedfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions areaccomplished in your brethren that are in the world but the god of all grace who hath called us unto his eternalglory by christ jesus after that ye have suffered a while make youperfect stablish strengthen settle you to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever amen by silvanus a faithful brother unto you as i suppose i havewritten briefly exhorting and testifying that this is the true graceof god wherein ye stand the church that is at babylon elected together with yousaluteth you and so doth marcus my son greet ye one another with a kiss of charity peace be with youall that are in christ jesus amenthe second general epistle of peter simon peter a servant and an apostle of jesus christ to themthat have obtained like precious faith with us through therighteousness of god and our saviour jesus christ  grace and peacebe multiplied unto you through the knowledge of god and of jesus ourlord  according as his divine power hath given unto us all thingsthat pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of himthat hath called us to glory and virtue  whereby are given unto usexceeding great and precious promises that by these ye might bepartakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that isin the world through lust and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtueand to virtue knowledge  and to knowledge temperance and totemperance patience and to patience godliness  and to godlinessbrotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that yeshall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lordjesus christ but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afaroff and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make yourcalling and election sure for if ye do these things ye shall neverfall  for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantlyinto the everlasting kingdom of our lord and saviour jesus christ wherefore i will not be negligent to put you always inremembrance of these things though ye know them and be establishedin the present truth yea i think it meet as long as i am in this tabernacle to stiryou up by putting you in remembrance  knowing that shortly i mustput off this my tabernacle even as our lord jesus christ hath shewedme moreover i will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease tohave these things always in remembrance for we have not followed cunningly devised fables when we madeknown unto you the power and coming of our lord jesus christ but wereeyewitnesses of his majesty for he received from god the father honour and glory when therecame such a voice to him from the excellent glory this is my belovedson in whom i am well pleased and this voice which came from heaven we heard when we were withhim in the holy mount we have also a more sure word of prophecy whereunto ye do wellthat ye take heed as unto a light that shineth in a dark place untilthe day dawn and the day star arise in your hearts  knowing thisfirst that no prophecy of the scripture is of any privateinterpretation for the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man butholy men of god spake as they were moved by the holy ghost but there were false prophets also among the people even as thereshall be false teachers among you who privily shall bring in damnableheresies even denying the lord that bought them and bring uponthemselves swift destruction and many shall follow their pernicious ways by reason of whom theway of truth shall be evil spoken of and through covetousness shall they with feigned words makemerchandise of you whose judgment now of a long time lingereth notand their damnation slumbereth not for if god spared not the angels that sinned but cast them downto hell and delivered them into chains of darkness to be reservedunto judgment  and spared not the old world but saved noah theeighth person a preacher of righteousness bringing in the flood uponthe world of the ungodly  and turning the cities of sodom andgomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow making them anensample unto those that after should live ungodly  and deliveredjust lot vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked  forthat righteous man dwelling among them in seeing and hearing vexedhis righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds  thelord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations and toreserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished  butchiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness anddespise government presumptuous are they selfwilled they are notafraid to speak evil of dignities whereas angels which are greater in power and might bring notrailing accusation against them before the lord but these as natural brute beasts made to be taken anddestroyed speak evil of the things that they understand not andshall utterly perish in their own corruption  and shall receivethe reward of unrighteousness as they that count it pleasure to riotin the day time spots they are and blemishes sporting themselveswith their own deceivings while they feast with you  having eyesfull of adultery and that cannot cease from sin beguiling unstablesouls an heart they have exercised with covetous practices cursedchildren  which have forsaken the right way and are gone astrayfollowing the way of balaam the son of bosor who loved the wages ofunrighteousness  but was rebuked for his iniquity the dumb assspeaking with mans voice forbad the madness of the prophet these are wells without water clouds that are carried with atempest to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever for when they speak great swelling words of vanity they allurethrough the lusts of the flesh through much wantonness those thatwere clean escaped from them who live in error while they promise them liberty they themselves are the servantsof corruption for of whom a man is overcome of the same is hebrought in bondage for if after they have escaped the pollutions of the worldthrough the knowledge of the lord and saviour jesus christ they areagain entangled therein and overcome the latter end is worse withthem than the beginning for it had been better for them not to have known the way ofrighteousness than after they have known it to turn from the holycommandment delivered unto them but it is happened unto them according to the true proverb thedog is turned to his own vomit again and the sow that was washed toher wallowing in the mire this second epistle beloved i now write unto you in both whichi stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance  that ye may bemindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophetsand of the commandment of us the apostles of the lord and saviour knowing this first that there shall come in the last days scofferswalking after their own lusts  and saying where is the promise ofhis coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue asthey were from the beginning of the creation for this they willingly are ignorant of that by the word of godthe heavens were of old and the earth standing out of the water andin the water  whereby the world that then was being overflowedwith water perished  but the heavens and the earth which arenow by the same word are kept in store reserved unto fire againstthe day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day iswith the lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day the lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men countslackness but is longsuffering to usward not willing that anyshould perish but that all should come to repentance but the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night in thewhich the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the elementsshall melt with fervent heat the earth also and the works that aretherein shall be burned up seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved what mannerof persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of god wherein theheavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall meltwith fervent heat   nevertheless we according to his promiselook for new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness wherefore beloved seeing that ye look for such things bediligent that ye may be found of him in peace without spot andblameless and account that the longsuffering of our lord is salvation evenas our beloved brother paul also according to the wisdom given untohim hath written unto you  as also in all his epistles speakingin them of these things in which are some things hard to beunderstood which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest as theydo also the other scriptures unto their own destruction ye therefore beloved seeing ye know these things before bewarelest ye also being led away with the error of the wicked fall fromyour own stedfastness but grow in grace and in the knowledge of our lord and saviourjesus christ to him be glory both now and for ever amenthe first epistle general of john that which was from the beginning which we have heard which wehave seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands havehandled of the word of life  for the life was manifested and

little children these things write i unto you that ye sinnotand if any man sin we have an advocate with the father jesus christthe righteous  and he is the propitiation for our sins and notfor ours only but also for the sins of the whole world and hereby we do know that we know him if we keep hiscommandments he that saith i know him and keepeth not his commandments is aliar and the truth is not in him but whoso keepeth his word in him verily is the love of godperfected hereby know we that we are in him he that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walkeven as he walked brethren i write no new commandment unto you but an oldcommandment which ye had from the beginning the old commandment isthe word which ye have heard from the beginning again a new commandment i write unto you which thing is true inhim and in you because the darkness is past and the true light nowshineth he that saith he is in the light and hateth his brother is indarkness even until now he that loveth his brother abideth in the light and there isnone occasion of stumbling in him but he that hateth his brother is in darkness and walketh indarkness and knoweth not whither he goeth because that darkness hathblinded his eyes i write unto you little children because your sins are forgivenyou for his names sake i write unto you fathers because ye have known him that is fromthe beginning i write unto you young men because ye have overcomethe wicked one i write unto you little children because ye haveknown the father i have written unto you fathers because ye have known him thatis from the beginning i have written unto you young men because yeare strong and the word of god abideth in you and ye have overcomethe wicked one love not the world neither the things that are in the world ifany man love the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh and the lustof the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is ofthe world and the world passeth away and the lust thereof but he thatdoeth the will of god abideth for ever little children it is the last time and as ye have heard thatantichrist shall come even now are there many antichrists whereby weknow that it is the last time they went out from us but they were not of us for if they hadbeen of us they would no doubt have continued with us but they wentout that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us but ye have an unction from the holy one and ye know all things i have not written unto you because ye know not the truth butbecause ye know it and that no lie is of the truth who is a liar but he that denieth that jesus is the christ he isantichrist that denieth the father and the son whosoever denieth the son the same hath not the father he thatacknowledgeth the son hath the father also let that therefore abide in you which ye have heard from thebeginning if that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remainin you ye also shall continue in the son and in the father and this is the promise that he hath promised us even eternallife these things have i written unto you concerning them that seduceyou but the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in youand ye need not that any man teach you but as the same anointingteacheth you of all things and is truth and is no lie and even asit hath taught you ye shall abide in him and now little children abide in him that when he shallappear we may have confidence and not be ashamed before him at hiscoming if ye know that he is righteous ye know that every one thatdoeth righteousness is born of him behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us thatwe should be called the sons of god therefore the world knoweth usnot because it knew him not beloved now are we the sons of god and it doth not yet appearwhat we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall belike him for we shall see him as he is and every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself evenas he is pure whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law for sin isthe transgression of the law and ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins and inhim is no sin whosoever abideth in him sinneth not whosoever sinneth hath notseen him neither known him little children let no man deceive you he that doethrighteousness is righteous even as he is righteous he that committeth sin is of the devil for the devil sinneth fromthe beginning for this purpose the son of god was manifested that hemight destroy the works of the devil whosoever is born of god doth not commit sin for his seedremaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of god in this the children of god are manifest and the children of thedevil whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of god neither hethat loveth not his brother for this is the message that ye heard from the beginning that weshould love one another not as cain who was of that wicked one and slew his brotherand wherefore slew he him because his own works were evil and hisbrothers righteous marvel not my brethren if the world hate you we know that we have passed from death unto life because we lovethe brethren he that loveth not his brother abideth in death whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer and ye know that nomurderer hath eternal life abiding in him hereby perceive we the love of god because he laid down his lifefor us and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren but whoso hath this worlds good and seeth his brother haveneed and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him how dwelleththe love of god in him   my little children let us not love inword neither in tongue but in deed and in truth and hereby we know that we are of the truth and shall assure ourhearts before him for if our heart condemn us god is greater than our heart andknoweth all things beloved if our heart condemn us not then have we confidencetoward god and whatsoever we ask we receive of him because we keep hiscommandments and do those things that are pleasing in his sight and this is his commandment that we should believe on the nameof his son jesus christ and love one another as he gave uscommandment and he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him and he inhimand hereby we know that he abideth in us by the spirit which he hathgiven us beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whetherthey are of god because many false prophets are gone out into theworld hereby know ye the spirit of god every spirit that confesseththat jesus christ is come in the flesh is of god  and every spiritthat confesseth not that jesus christ is come in the flesh is not ofgod and this is that spirit of antichrist whereof ye have heard thatit should come and even now already is it in the world ye are of god little children and have overcome them becausegreater is he that is in you than he that is in the world they are of the world therefore speak they of the world and theworld heareth them we are of god he that knoweth god heareth us he that is not ofgod heareth not us hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spiritof error beloved let us love one another for love is of god and everyone that loveth is born of god and knoweth god he that loveth not knoweth not god for god is love in this was manifested the love of god toward us because that godsent his only begotten son into the world that we might live throughhim herein is love not that we loved god but that he loved us andsent his son to be the propitiation for our sins beloved if god so loved us we ought also to love one another no man hath seen god at any time if we love one another goddwelleth in us and his love is perfected in us hereby know we that we dwell in him and he in us because hehath given us of his spirit and we have seen and do testify that the father sent the son tobe the saviour of the world whosoever shall confess that jesus is the son of god goddwelleth in him and he in god and we have known and believed the love that god hath to us godis love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in god and god in him herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in theday of judgment because as he is so are we in this world there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fearbecause fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect inlove we love him because he first loved us if a man say i love god and hateth his brother he is a liarfor he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen how can he lovegod whom he hath not seen   and this commandment have we fromhim that he who loveth god love his brother also whosoever believeth that jesus is the christ is born of god andevery one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begottenof him by this we know that we love the children of god when we lovegod and keep his commandments for this is the love of god that we keep his commandments andhis commandments are not grievous for whatsoever is born of god overcometh the world and this isthe victory that overcometh the world even our faith who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth thatjesus is the son of god   this is he that came by water and bloodeven jesus christ not by water only but by water and blood and itis the spirit that beareth witness because the spirit is truth for there are three that bear record in heaven the father theword and the holy ghost and these three are one and there are three that bear witness in earth the spirit andthe water and the blood and these three agree in one if we receive the witness of men the witness of god is greaterfor this is the witness of god which he hath testified of his son he that believeth on the son of god hath the witness in himselfhe that believeth not god hath made him a liar because he believethnot the record that god gave of his son and this is the record that god hath given to us eternal lifeand this life is in his son he that hath the son hath life and he that hath not the son ofgod hath not life these things have i written unto you that believe on the name ofthe son of god that ye may know that ye have eternal life and thatye may believe on the name of the son of god and this is the confidence that we have in him that if we askany thing according to his will he heareth us  and if we knowthat he hear us whatsoever we ask we know that we have the petitionsthat we desired of him if any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death heshall ask and he shall give him life for them that sin not untodeath there is a sin unto death i do not say that he shall pray forit all unrighteousness is sin and there is a sin not unto death we know that whosoever is born of god sinneth not but he that isbegotten of god keepeth himself and that wicked one toucheth him not and we know that we are of god and the whole world lieth inwickedness and we know that the son of god is come and hath given us anunderstanding that we may know him that is true and we are in himthat is true even in his son jesus christ this is the true god andeternal life little children keep yourselves from idols amenthe second epistle general of john the elder unto the elect lady and her children whom i love inthe truth and not i only but also all they that have known thetruth  for the truths sake which dwelleth in us and shall bewith us for ever grace be with you mercy and peace from god the father and fromthe lord jesus christ the son of the father in truth and love i rejoiced greatly that i found of thy children walking in truthas we have received a commandment from the father and now i beseech thee lady not as though i wrote a newcommandment unto thee but that which we had from the beginning thatwe love one another and this is love that we walk after his commandments this is thecommandment that as ye have heard from the beginning ye should walkin it for many deceivers are entered into the world who confess notthat jesus christ is come in the flesh this is a deceiver and anantichrist look to yourselves that we lose not those things which we havewrought but that we receive a full reward whosoever transgresseth and abideth not in the doctrine ofchrist hath not god he that abideth in the doctrine of christ hehath both the father and the son if there come any unto you and bring not this doctrine receivehim not into your house neither bid him god speed  for he thatbiddeth him god speed is partaker of his evil deeds having many things to write unto you i would not write withpaper and ink but i trust to come unto you and speak face to facethat our joy may be full the children of thy elect sister greet thee amenthe third epistle general of john the elder unto the wellbeloved gaius whom i love in the truth beloved i wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and bein health even as thy soul prospereth for i rejoiced greatly when the brethren came and testified ofthe truth that is in thee even as thou walkest in the truth i have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth beloved thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to thebrethren and to strangers  which have borne witness of thycharity before the church whom if thou bring forward on their journeyafter a godly sort thou shalt do well  because that for hisnames sake they went forth taking nothing of the gentiles we therefore ought to receive such that we might be fellowhelpersto the truth i wrote unto the church but diotrephes who loveth to have thepreeminence among them receiveth us not wherefore if i come i will remember his deeds which he doethprating against us with malicious words and not content therewithneither doth he himself receive the brethren and forbiddeth them thatwould and casteth them out of the church beloved follow not that which is evil but that which is goodhe that doeth good is of god but he that doeth evil hath not seengod demetrius hath good report of all men and of the truth itselfyea and we also bear record and ye know that our record is true i had many things to write but i will not with ink and pen writeunto thee  but i trust i shall shortly see thee and we shallspeak

father and preserved in jesus christand called  mercy unto you and peace and love be multiplied beloved when i gave all diligence to write unto you of the commonsalvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort youthat ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was oncedelivered unto the saints for there are certain men crept in unawares who were before ofold ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace ofour god into lasciviousness and denying the only lord god and ourlord jesus christ i will therefore put you in remembrance though ye once knew thishow that the lord having saved the people out of the land of egyptafterward destroyed them that believed not and the angels which kept not their first estate but left theirown habitation he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darknessunto the judgment of the great day even as sodom and gomorrha and the cities about them in likemanner giving themselves over to fornication and going after strangeflesh are set forth for an example suffering the vengeance ofeternal fire likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh despisedominion and speak evil of dignities yet michael the archangel when contending with the devil hedisputed about the body of moses durst not bring against him arailing accusation but said the lord rebuke thee but these speak evil of those things which they know not butwhat they know naturally as brute beasts in those things theycorrupt themselves woe unto them for they have gone in the way of cain and rangreedily after the error of balaam for reward and perished in thegainsaying of core these are spots in your feasts of charity when they feast withyou feeding themselves without fear clouds they are without watercarried about of winds trees whose fruit withereth without fruittwice dead plucked up by the roots  raging waves of the seafoaming out their own shame wandering stars to whom is reserved theblackness of darkness for ever and enoch also the seventh from adam prophesied of thesesaying behold the lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints to execute judgment upon all and to convince all that are ungodlyamong them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodlycommitted and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners havespoken against him these are murmurers complainers walking after their own lustsand their mouth speaketh great swelling words having mens persons inadmiration because of advantage but beloved remember ye the words which were spoken before ofthe apostles of our lord jesus christ  how that they told youthere should be mockers in the last time who should walk after theirown ungodly lusts these be they who separate themselves sensual having not thespirit but ye beloved building up yourselves on your most holy faithpraying in the holy ghost  keep yourselves in the love of godlooking for the mercy of our lord jesus christ unto eternal life and of some have compassion making a

asia unto ephesus and untosmyrna and unto pergamos and unto thyatira and unto sardis andunto philadelphia and unto laodicea and i turned to see the voice that spake with me and beingturned i saw seven golden candlesticks  and in the midst of theseven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with agarment down to the foot and girt about the paps with a goldengirdle his head and his hairs were white like wool as white as snowand his eyes were as a flame of fire  and his feet like unto finebrass as if they burned in a furnace and his voice as the sound ofmany waters and he had in his

likeunto an emerald and round about the throne were four and twenty seats and uponthe seats i saw four and twenty elders sitting clothed in whiteraiment and they had on their heads crowns of gold and out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings andvoices and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the thronewhich are the seven spirits of god and before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystaland in the midst of the throne and round about the throne were fourbeasts full of eyes before and behind and the first beast was like a lion and the second beast like acalf and the third beast had a face as a man and the fourth beastwas like a flying eagle and the four beasts had each of them six wings about him and theywere full of eyes within and they rest not day and night sayingholy holy holy lord god almighty which was and is and is tocome and when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him thatsat on the throne who liveth for ever and ever  the four andtwenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne and worshiphim that liveth for ever and ever and cast their crowns before thethrone saying  thou art worthy o lord to receive glory andhonour and power for thou hast created all things and for thypleasure they are and were created and i saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a bookwritten within and on the backside sealed with seven seals and i saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who isworthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof   and noman in heaven nor in earth neither under the earth was able to openthe book neither to look thereon and i wept much because no man was found worthy to open and toread the book neither to look thereon and one of the elders saith unto me weep not behold the lion ofthe tribe of juda the root of david hath prevailed to open the bookand to loose the seven seals thereof and i beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the fourbeasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had beenslain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spiritsof god sent forth into all the earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him thatsat upon the throne and when he had taken the book the four beasts and four andtwenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of themharps and golden vials full of odours which are the prayers ofsaints and they sung a new song saying thou art worthy to take thebook and to open the seals thereof for thou wast slain and hastredeemed us to god by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue andpeople and nation  and hast made us unto our god kings andpriests and we shall reign on the earth and i beheld and i heard the voice of many angels round aboutthe throne and the beasts and the elders and the number of them wasten thousand times ten thousand and thousands of thousands saying with a loud voice worthy is the lamb that was slain to receivepower and riches and wisdom and strength and honour and gloryand blessing and every creature which is in heaven and on the earth andunder the earth and such as are in the sea and all that are in themheard i saying blessing and honour and glory and power be untohim that sitteth upon the throne and unto the lamb for ever and ever and the four beasts said amen and the four and twenty eldersfell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever and i saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and i heard asit were the noise of thunder one of the four beasts saying come andsee and i saw and behold a white horse and he that sat on him had abow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering andto conquer and when he had opened the second seal i heard the second beastsay come and see and there went out another horse that was red and power was givento him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth and that theyshould kill one another and there was given unto him a great sword and when he had opened the third seal i heard the third beastsay come and see and i beheld and lo a black horse and he that saton him had a pair of balances in his hand and i heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say a measureof wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny andsee thou hurt not the oil and the wine and when he had opened the fourth seal i heard the voice of thefourth beast say come and see and i looked and behold a pale horse and his name that sat onhim was death and hell followed with him and power was given untothem over the fourth part of the earth to kill with sword and withhunger and with death and with the beasts of the earth and when he had opened the fifth seal i saw under the altar thesouls of them that were slain for the word of god and for thetestimony which they held  and they cried with a loud voicesaying how long o lord holy and true dost thou not judge andavenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth   and whiterobes were given unto every one of them and it was said unto themthat they should rest yet for a little season until theirfellowservants also and their brethren that should be killed as theywere should be fulfilled and i beheld when he had opened the sixth seal and lo therewas a great earthquake and the sun became black as sackcloth of hairand the moon became as blood  and the stars of heaven fell untothe earth even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs when she isshaken of a mighty wind and the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled togetherand every mountain and island were moved out of their places and the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich menand the chief captains and the mighty men and every bondman andevery free man hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of themountains  and said to the mountains and rocks fall on us andhide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne and from thewrath of the lamb  for the great day of his wrath is come andwho shall be able to stand   and after these things i saw fourangels standing on the four corners of the earth holding the fourwinds of the earth that the wind should not blow on the earth nor onthe sea nor on any tree and i saw another angel ascending from the east having the sealof the living god and he cried with a loud voice to the four angelsto whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea  saying hurtnot the earth neither the sea nor the trees till we have sealed theservants of our god in their foreheads and i heard the number of them which were sealed and there weresealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of thechildren of israel of the tribe of juda were sealed twelve thousand of the tribe ofreuben were sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of gad were sealedtwelve thousand of the tribe of aser were sealed twelve thousand of the tribe ofnephthalim were sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of manasses weresealed twelve thousand of the tribe of simeon were sealed twelve thousand

throne and before the lamb clothed with whiterobes and palms in their hands  and cried with a loud voicesaying salvation to our god which sitteth upon the throne and untothe lamb and all the angels stood round about the throne and about theelders and the four beasts and fell before the throne on their facesand worshipped god  saying amen blessing and glory andwisdom and thanksgiving and honour and power and might be untoour god for ever and ever amen and one of the elders answered saying unto me what are thesewhich are arrayed in white robes and whence came they   and isaid unto him sir thou knowest and he said to me these are theywhich came out of great tribulation and have washed their robes andmade them white in the blood of the lamb therefore are they before the throne of god and serve him dayand night in his temple and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwellamong them they shall hunger no more neither thirst any more neither shallthe sun light on them nor any heat for the lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed themand shall lead them unto living fountains of waters and god shallwipe away all tears from their eyes and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence inheaven about the space of half an hour and i saw the seven angels which stood before god and to themwere given seven trumpets and another angel came and stood at the altar having a goldencenser and there was given unto him much incense that he shouldoffer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar whichwas before the throne and the smoke of the incense which came with the prayers of thesaints ascended up before god out of the angels hand and the angel took the censer and filled it with fire of thealtar and cast it into the earth and there were voices andthunderings and lightnings and an earthquake and the seven angels which had the seven trumpets preparedthemselves to sound the first angel sounded and there followed hail and fire mingledwith blood and they were cast upon the earth and the third part oftrees was burnt up and all green grass was burnt up and the second angel sounded and as it were a great mountainburning with fire was cast into the sea and the third part of the seabecame blood  and the third part of the creatures which were inthe sea and had life died and the third part of the ships weredestroyed and the third angel sounded and there fell a great star fromheaven burning as it were a lamp and it fell upon the third part ofthe rivers and upon the fountains of waters  and the name of thestar is called wormwood and the third part of the waters becamewormwood and many men died of the waters because they were madebitter and the fourth angel sounded and the third part of the sun wassmitten and the third part of the moon and the third part of thestars so as the third part of them was darkened and the day shonenot for a third part of it and the night likewise and i beheld and heard an angel flying through the midst ofheaven saying with a loud voice woe woe woe to the inhabiters ofthe earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the threeangels which are yet to sound   and the fifth angel sounded andi saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth and to him was given thekey of the bottomless pit and he opened the bottomless pit and there arose a smoke out ofthe pit as the smoke of a great furnace and the sun and the air weredarkened by reason of the smoke of the pit and there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth and untothem was given power as the scorpions of the earth have power and it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass ofthe earth neither any green thing neither any tree but only thosemen which have not the seal of god in their foreheads and to them it was given that they should not kill them but thatthey should be tormented five months and their torment was as thetorment of a scorpion when he striketh a man and in those days shall men seek death and shall not find it andshall desire to die and death shall flee from them and the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared untobattle and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold and theirfaces were as the faces of men and they had hair as the hair of women and their teeth were asthe teeth of lions and they had breastplates as it were breastplates of iron andthe sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horsesrunning to battle and they had tails like unto scorpions and there were stings intheir tails and their power was to hurt men five months and they had a king over them which is the angel of thebottomless pit whose name in the hebrew tongue is abaddon but in thegreek tongue hath his name apollyon one woe is past and behold there come two woes more hereafter and the sixth angel sounded and i heard a voice from the fourhorns of the golden altar which is before god  saying to thesixth angel which had the trumpet loose the four angels which arebound in the great river euphrates and the four angels were loosed which were prepared for an hourand a day and a month and a year for to slay the third part of men and the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundredthousand thousand and i heard the number of them and thus i saw the horses in the vision and them that sat onthem having breastplates of fire and of jacinth and brimstone andthe heads of the horses were as the heads of lions and out of theirmouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone by these three was the third part of men killed by the fire andby the smoke and by the brimstone which issued out of their mouths for their power is in their mouth and in their tails for theirtails were like unto serpents and had heads and with them they dohurt and the rest of the men which were not killed by these plaguesyet repented not of the works of their hands that they should notworship devils and idols of gold and silver and brass and stoneand of wood which neither can see nor hear nor walk  neitherrepented they of their murders nor of their sorceries nor of theirfornication nor of their thefts and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothedwith a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as itwere the sun and his feet as pillars of fire  and he had in hishand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea andhis left foot on the earth  and cried with a loud voice as whena lion roareth and when he had cried seven thunders uttered theirvoices and when the seven thunders had uttered their voices i was aboutto write and i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me seal upthose things which the seven thunders uttered and write them not and the angel which i saw stand upon the sea and upon the earthlifted up his hand to heaven  and sware by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein areand the earth and the things that therein are and the sea and thethings which are therein that there should be time no longer but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall beginto sound the mystery of god should be finished as he hath declaredto his servants the prophets and the voice which i heard from heaven spake unto me again andsaid go and take the little book which is open in the hand of theangel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth and i went unto the angel and said unto him give me the littlebook and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall makethy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and i took the little book out of the angels hand and ate itup and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as i had eatenit my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before manypeoples and nations and tongues and kings and there was given me a reed like unto a rod and the angelstood saying rise and measure the temple of god and the altar andthem that worship therein but the court which is without the temple leave out and measureit not for it is given unto the gentiles and the holy city shallthey tread under foot forty and two months and i will give power unto my two witnesses and they shallprophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days clothed insackcloth these are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks standingbefore the god of the earth and if any man will hurt them fire proceedeth out of theirmouth and devoureth their enemies and if any man will hurt them hemust in this manner be killed these have power to shut heaven that it rain not in the days oftheir prophecy and have power over waters to turn them to blood andto smite the earth with all plagues as often as they will and when they shall have finished their testimony the beast thatascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them andshall overcome them and kill them and their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great citywhich spiritually is called sodom and egypt where also our lord wascrucified and they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shallsee their dead bodies three days and an half and shall not suffertheir dead bodies to be put in graves and they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them andmake merry and shall send gifts one to another because these twoprophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth and after three days and an half the spirit of life from godentered into them and they stood upon their feet and great fear fellupon them which saw them and they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them comeup hither and they ascended up to heaven in a cloud and theirenemies beheld them and the same hour was there a great earthquake and the tenthpart of the city fell and in the earthquake were slain of men seventhousand and the remnant were affrighted and gave glory to the godof heaven the second woe is past and behold the third woe comethquickly and the seventh angel sounded and there were great voices inheaven saying the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms ofour lord and of his christ and he shall reign for ever and ever and the four and twenty elders which sat before god on theirseats fell upon their faces and worshipped god  saying wegive thee thanks o lord god almighty which art and wast and art tocome because thou hast taken to thee thy great power and hastreigned and the nations were angry and thy wrath is come and the timeof the dead that they should be judged and that thou shouldest givereward unto thy servants the prophets and to the saints and themthat fear thy name small and great and shouldest destroy them whichdestroy the earth and the temple of god was opened in heaven and there was seenin his temple the ark of his testament and there were lightnings andvoices and thunderings and an earthquake and great hail and there appeared a great wonder in heaven a woman clothed withthe sun and the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown oftwelve stars  and she being with child cried travailing inbirth and pained to be delivered and there appeared another wonder in heaven and behold a greatred dragon having seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns uponhis heads and his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven and didcast them to the earth and the dragon stood before the woman whichwas ready to be delivered for to devour her child as soon as it wasborn and she brought forth a man child who was to rule all nationswith a rod of iron and her child was caught up unto god and to histhrone and the woman fled into the wilderness where she hath a placeprepared of god that they should feed her there a thousand twohundred and threescore days and there was war in heaven michael and his angels foughtagainst the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels  andprevailed not neither was their place found any more in heaven and the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called thedevil and satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast outinto the earth and his angels were cast out with him and i heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is comesalvation and strength and the kingdom of our god and the power ofhis christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down whichaccused them before our god day and night and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the wordof their testimony and they loved not their lives unto the death therefore rejoice ye heavens and ye that dwell in them woe tothe inhabiters of the earth and of the sea for the devil is come downunto you having great wrath because he knoweth that he hath but ashort time and when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth hepersecuted the woman which brought forth the man child and to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle that shemight fly into the wilderness into her place where she is nourishedfor a time and times and half a time from the face of the serpent and the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after thewoman that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood and the earth helped the woman and the earth opened her mouthand swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth and the dragon was wroth with the woman and went to make warwith the remnant of her seed which keep the commandments of god andhave the testimony of jesus christ and i stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up outof the sea having seven heads and ten horns and upon his horns tencrowns and upon his heads the name of blasphemy and the beast which i saw was like unto a leopard and his feetwere as the feet of a bear and his mouth as the mouth of a lion andthe dragon gave him his power and his seat and great authority and i saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death and hisdeadly wound was healed and all the world wondered after the beast and they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beastand they worshipped the beast saying who is like unto the beast whois able to make war with him   and there was given unto him amouth speaking great things and blasphemies and power was given untohim to continue forty and two months and he opened his mouth in blasphemy against god to blasphemehis name and his tabernacle and them that dwell in heaven and it was given unto him to make war with the saints and toovercome them and power was given him over all kindreds and tonguesand nations and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose namesare not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from thefoundation of the world if any man have an ear let him hear he that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity he thatkilleth with the sword must be killed with the sword here is thepatience and the faith of the saints and i beheld another beast coming up out of the earth and hehad two horns like a lamb and he spake as a dragon and he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before himand causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship thefirst beast whose deadly wound was healed and he doeth great wonders so that he maketh fire come downfrom heaven on the earth in the sight of men  and deceiveth themthat dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he hadpower to do in the sight of the beast saying to them that dwell onthe earth that they should make an image to the beast which had thewound by a sword and did live and he had power to give life unto the image of the beast thatthe image of the beast should both speak and cause that as many aswould not worship the image of the beast should be killed and he causeth all both small and great rich and poor freeand bond to receive a mark in their right hand or in theirforeheads  and that no man might buy or sell save he that hadthe mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name here is wisdom let him that hath understanding count the numberof the beast for it is the number of a man and his number is sixhundred threescore and six and i looked and lo a lamb stood on the mount sion and withhim an hundred forty and four thousand having his fathers namewritten in their foreheads and i heard a voice from heaven as the voice of many waters andas the voice of a great thunder and i heard the voice of harpersharping with their harps  and they sung as it were a new songbefore the throne and before the four beasts and the elders and noman could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousandwhich were redeemed from the earth these are they which were not defiled with women for they arevirgins these are they which follow the lamb whithersoever he goeththese were redeemed from among men being the firstfruits unto god andto the lamb and in their mouth was found no guile for they are without faultbefore the throne of god and i saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven having theeverlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth and toevery nation and kindred and tongue and people  saying with aloud voice fear god and give glory to him for the hour of hisjudgment is come and worship him that made heaven and earth and thesea and the fountains of waters and there followed another angel saying babylon is fallen isfallen that great city because she made all nations drink of thewine of the wrath of her fornication and the third angel followed them saying with a loud voice ifany man worship the beast and his image and receive his mark in hisforehead or in his hand  the same shall drink of the wine ofthe wrath of god which is poured out without mixture into the cup ofhis indignation and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone inthe presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the lamb and the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and everand they have no rest day nor night who worship the beast and hisimage and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name here is the patience of the saints here are they that keep thecommandments of god and the faith of jesus and i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me write blessedare the dead which die in the lord from henceforth yea saith thespirit that they may rest from their labours and their works dofollow them and i looked and behold a white cloud and upon the cloud onesat like unto the son of man having on his head a golden crown andin his hand a sharp sickle and another angel came out of the temple crying with a loudvoice to him that sat on the cloud thrust in thy sickle and reapfor the time is come for thee to reap for the harvest of the earth isripe and he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earthand the earth was reaped and another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven healso having a sharp sickle and another angel came out from the altar which had power overfire and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sicklesaying thrust in thy sharp sickle and gather the clusters of thevine of the earth for her grapes are fully ripe and the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth and gatheredthe vine of the earth and cast it into the great winepress of thewrath of god and the winepress was trodden without the city and blood cameout of the winepress even unto the horse bridles by the space of athousand and six hundred furlongs and i saw another sign in heaven great and marvellous sevenangels having the seven last plagues for in them is filled up thewrath of god and i saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire and themthat had gotten the victory over the beast and over his image andover his mark and over the number of his name stand on the sea ofglass having the harps of god and they sing the song of moses the servant of god and the songof the lamb saying great and marvellous are thy works lord godalmighty just and true are thy ways thou king of saints who shall not fear thee o lord and glorify thy name for thouonly art holy for all nations shall come and worship before thee forthy judgments are made manifest and after that i looked and behold the temple of thetabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened  and the sevenangels came out of the temple having the seven plagues clothed inpure and white linen and having their breasts girded with goldengirdles and one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels sevengolden vials full of the wrath of god who liveth for ever and ever and the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of god andfrom his power and no man was able to enter into the temple till theseven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled and i heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the sevenangels go your ways and pour out the vials of the wrath of god uponthe earth and the first went and poured out his vial upon the earth andthere fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the markof the beast and upon them which worshipped his image and the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea and itbecame as the blood of a dead man and every living soul died in thesea and the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers andfountains of waters and they became blood and i heard the angel of the waters say thou art righteous olord which art and wast and shalt be because thou hast judgedthus for they have shed the blood of saints and prophets and thouhast given them blood to drink for they are worthy and i heard another out of the altar say even so lord godalmighty true and righteous are thy judgments and the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun and powerwas given unto him to scorch men with fire and men were scorched with great heat and blasphemed the name ofgod which hath power over these plagues and they repented not togive him glory and the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of thebeast and his kingdom was full of darkness and they gnawed theirtongues for pain  and blasphemed the god of heaven because oftheir pains and their sores and repented not of their deeds and the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great rivereuphrates and the water thereof was dried up that the way of thekings of the east might be prepared and i saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouthof the dragon and out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouthof the false prophet for they are the spirits of devils working miracles which goforth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world to gatherthem to the battle of that great day of god almighty behold i come as a thief blessed is he that watcheth andkeepeth his garments lest he walk naked and they see his shame and he gathered them together into a place called in the hebrewtongue armageddon and the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air andthere came a great voice out of the temple of heaven from the thronesaying it is done and there were voices and thunders and lightnings and therewas a great earthquake such as was not since men were upon the earthso mighty an earthquake and so great and the great city was divided into three parts and the citiesof the nations fell and great babylon came in remembrance before godto give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath and every island fled away and the mountains were not found and there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven every stoneabout the weight of a talent and men blasphemed god because of theplague of the hail for the plague thereof was exceeding great and there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vialsand talked with me saying unto me come hither i will shew unto theethe judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication and theinhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of herfornication so he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness and isaw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast full of names ofblasphemy having seven heads and ten horns and the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour anddecked with gold and precious stones and pearls having a golden cupin her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication and upon her forehead was a name written mystery babylon thegreat the mother of harlots and abominations of the earth and i saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints andwith the blood of the martyrs of jesus and when i saw her i wonderedwith great admiration and the angel said unto me wherefore didst thou marvel i willtell thee the mystery of the woman and of the beast that carriethher which hath the seven heads and ten horns the beast that thou sawest was and is not and shall ascend outof the bottomless pit and go into perdition and they that dwell onthe earth shall wonder whose names were not written in the book oflife from the foundation of the world when they behold the beast thatwas and is not and yet is and here is the mind which hath wisdom the seven heads are sevenmountains on which the woman sitteth and there are seven kings five are fallen and one is and theother is not yet come and when he cometh he must continue a shortspace and the beast that was and is not even he is the eighth andis of the seven and goeth into perdition and the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings which havereceived no kingdom as yet but receive power as kings one hour withthe beast these have one mind and shall give their power and strengthunto the beast these shall make war with the lamb and the lamb shall overcomethem for he is lord of lords and king of kings and they that arewith him are called and chosen and faithful and he saith unto me the waters which thou sawest where thewhore sitteth are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues and the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast these shallhate the whore and shall make her desolate and naked and shall eather flesh and burn her with fire for god hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will and toagree and give their kingdom unto the beast until the words of godshall be fulfilled and the woman which thou sawest is that great city whichreigneth over the kings of the earth and after these things i saw another angel come down from heavenhaving great power and the earth was lightened with his glory and he cried mightily with a strong voice saying babylon thegreat is fallen is fallen and is become the habitation of devilsand the hold of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean andhateful bird for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of herfornication and the kings of the earth have committed fornicationwith her and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through theabundance of her delicacies and i heard another voice from heaven saying come out of hermy people that ye be not partakers of her sins and that ye receivenot of her plagues for her sins have reached unto heaven and god hath rememberedher iniquities reward her even as she rewarded you and double unto her doubleaccording to her works in the cup which she hath filled fill to herdouble how much she hath glorified herself and lived deliciously somuch torment and sorrow give her for she saith in her heart i sit aqueen and am no widow and shall see no sorrow therefore shall her plagues come in one day death and mourningand famine and she shall be utterly burned with fire for strong isthe lord god who judgeth her and the kings of the earth who have committed fornication andlived deliciously with her shall bewail her and lament for her whenthey shall see the smoke of her burning  standing afar off forthe fear of her torment saying alas alas that great city babylonthat mighty city for in one hour is thy judgment come and the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over herfor no man buyeth their merchandise any more  the merchandise ofgold and silver and precious stones and of pearls and fine linenand purple and silk and scarlet and all thyine wood and all mannervessels of ivory and all manner vessels of most precious wood and ofbrass and iron and marble  and cinnamon and odours andointments and frankincense and wine and oil and fine flour andwheat and beasts and sheep and horses and chariots and slavesand souls of men and the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed fromthee and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed fromthee and thou shalt find them no more at all the merchants of these things which were made rich by hershall stand afar off for the fear of her torment weeping and wailing and saying alas alas that great city that was clothed in finelinen and purple and scarlet and decked with gold and preciousstones and pearls   for in one hour so great riches is come tonought and every shipmaster and all the company in ships andsailors and as many as trade by sea stood afar off  and criedwhen they saw the smoke of her burning saying what city is like untothis great city   and they cast dust on their heads and criedweeping and wailing saying alas alas that great city wherein weremade rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costlinessfor in one hour is she made desolate rejoice over her thou heaven and ye holy apostles andprophets for god hath avenged you on her and a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone andcast it into the sea saying thus with violence shall that great citybabylon be thrown down and shall be found no more at all and the voice of harpers and musicians and of pipers andtrumpeters shall be heard no more at all in thee and no craftsmanof whatsoever craft he be shall be found any more in thee and thesound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee  andthe light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee and thevoice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at allin thee for thy merchants were the great men of the earth for by thysorceries were all nations deceived and in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints andof all that were slain upon the earth and after these things i heard a great voice of much people inheaven saying alleluia salvation and glory and honour and powerunto the lord our god  for true and righteous are his judgmentsfor he hath judged the great whore which did corrupt the earth withher fornication and hath avenged the blood of his servants at herhand and again they said alleluia and her smoke rose up for ever andever and the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down andworshipped god that sat on the throne saying amen alleluia and a voice came out of the throne saying praise our god allye his servants and ye that fear him both small and great and i heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and as thevoice of many waters and as the voice of mighty thunderings sayingalleluia for the lord god omnipotent reigneth let us be glad and rejoice and give honour to him for themarriage of the lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linenclean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints and he saith unto me write blessed are they which are calledunto the marriage supper of the lamb and he saith unto me these arethe true sayings of god and i fell at his feet to worship him and he said unto me seethou do it not i am thy fellowservant and of thy brethren that havethe testimony of jesus worship god for the testimony of jesus is thespirit of prophecy and i saw heaven opened and behold a white horse and he thatsat upon him was called faithful and true and in righteousness hedoth judge and make war his eyes were as a flame of fire and on his head were manycrowns and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself and he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood and his nameis called the word of god and the armies which were in heaven followed him upon whitehorses clothed in fine linen white and clean and out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword that with it he shouldsmite the nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron and hetreadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of almighty god and he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written kingof kings and lord of lords and i saw an angel standing in the sun and he cried with a loudvoice saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven comeand gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great god that ye may eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of captains and theflesh of mighty men and the flesh of horses and of them that sit onthem and the flesh of all men both free and bond both small andgreat and i saw the beast and the kings of the earth and theirarmies gathered together to make war against him that sat on thehorse and against his army and the beast was taken and with him the false prophet thatwrought miracles before him with which he deceived them that hadreceived the mark of the beast and them that worshipped his imagethese both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone and the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat uponthe horse which sword proceeded out of his mouth and all the fowlswere filled with their flesh and i saw an angel come down from heaven having the key of thebottomless pit and a great chain in his hand and he laid hold on the dragon that old serpent which is thedevil and satan and bound him a thousand years  and cast himinto the bottomless pit and shut him up and set a seal upon himthat he should deceive the nations no more till the thousand yearsshould be fulfilled and after that he must be loosed a little season and i saw thrones and they sat upon them and judgment was givenunto them and i saw the souls of them that were beheaded for thewitness of jesus and for the word of god and which had notworshipped the beast neither his image neither had received his markupon their foreheads or in their hands and they lived and reignedwith christ a thousand years but the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand yearswere finished this is the first resurrection blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrectionon such the second death hath no power but they shall be priests ofgod and of christ and shall reign with him a thousand years and when the thousand years are expired satan shall be loosedout of his prison  and shall go out to deceive the nations whichare in the four quarters of the earth gog and magog to gather themtogether to battle the number of whom is as the sand of the sea and they went up on the breadth of the earth and compassed thecamp of the saints about and the beloved city and fire came downfrom god out of heaven and devoured them and the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fireand brimstone where the beast and the false prophet are and shall betormented day and night for ever and ever and i saw a great white throne and him that sat on it fromwhose face the earth and the heaven fled away and there was found noplace for them and i saw the dead small and great stand before god and thebooks were opened and another book was opened which is the book oflife and the dead were judged out of those things which were writtenin the books according to their works and the sea gave up the dead which were in it and death andhell delivered up the dead which were in them and they were judgedevery man according to their works and death and hell were cast into the lake of fire this is thesecond death and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was castinto the lake of fire and i saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven andthe first earth were passed away and there was no more sea and i john saw the holy city new jerusalem coming down from godout of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and i heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold thetabernacle of god is with men and he will dwell with them and theyshall be his people and god himself shall be with them and be theirgod and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and thereshall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shallthere be any more pain for the former things are passed away and he that sat upon the throne said behold i make all thingsnewand he said unto me write for these words are true and faithful and he said unto me it is done i am alpha and omega thebeginning and the end i will give unto him that is athirst of thefountain of the water of life freely he that overcometh shall inherit all things and i will be hisgod and he shall be my son but the fearful and unbelieving and the abominable andmurderers and whoremongers and sorcerers and idolaters and allliars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire andbrimstone which is the second death and there came unto me one of the seven angels which had theseven vials full of the seven last plagues and talked with mesaying come hither i will shew thee the bride the lambs wife and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and highmountain and shewed me that great city the holy jerusalemdescending out of heaven from god  having the glory of god andher light was like unto a stone most precious even like a jasperstone clear as crystal  and had a wall great and high and hadtwelve gates and at the gates twelve angels and names writtenthereon which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children ofisrael  on the east three gates on the north three gates onthe south three gates and on the west three gates and the wall of the city had twelve foundations and in them thenames of the twelve apostles of the lamb and he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure thecity and the gates thereof and the wall thereof and the city lieth foursquare and the length is as large as thebreadth and he measured the city with the reed twelve thousandfurlongsthe length and the breadth and the height of it are equal and he measured the wall thereof an hundred and forty and fourcubits according to the measure of a man that is of the angel and the building of the wall of it was of jasper and the citywas pure gold like unto clear glass and the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished withall manner of precious stones the first foundation was jasper thesecond sapphire the third a chalcedony the fourth an emerald the fifth sardonyx the sixth sardius the seventhchrysolyte the eighth beryl the ninth a topaz the tenth achrysoprasus the eleventh a jacinth the twelfth an amethyst and the twelve gates were twelve pearls every several gate wasof one pearl and the street of the city was pure gold as it weretransparent glass and i saw no temple therein for the lord god almighty and thelamb are the temple of it and the city had no need of the sun neither of the moon toshine in it for the glory of god did lighten it and the lamb is thelight thereof and the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the lightof it and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour intoit and the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day for thereshall be no night there and they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations intoit and there shall in no wise enter into it any thing thatdefileth neither whatsoever worketh abomination or maketh a lie butthey which are written in the lambs book of life and he shewed me a pure river of water of life clear as crystalproceeding out of the throne of god and of the lamb in the midst of the street of it and on either side of theriver was there the tree of life which bare twelve manner of fruitsand yielded her fruit every month and the leaves of the tree were forthe healing of the nations and there shall be no more curse but the throne of god and ofthe lamb shall be in it and his servants shall serve him  andthey shall see his face and his name shall be in their foreheads and there shall be no night there and they need no candleneither light of the sun for the lord god giveth them light and theyshall reign for ever and ever and he said unto me these sayings are faithful and true and thelord god of the holy prophets sent his angel to shew unto his servantsthe things which must shortly be done behold i come quickly blessed is he that keepeth the sayings ofthe prophecy of this book and i john saw these things and heard them and when i had heardand seen i fell down to worship before the feet of the angel whichshewed me these things then saith he unto me see thou do it not for i am thyfellowservant and of thy brethren the prophets and of them whichkeep the sayings of this book worship god and he saith unto me seal not the sayings of the prophecy ofthis book for the time is at hand he that is unjust let him be unjust still and he which
